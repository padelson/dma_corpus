 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** ("Agreement") is made and entered
into as of July 21, 2005, by and among: **SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC SA** , a _societ
e anonyme_ organized under the laws of the Republic of France ("Parent");
**BEACON PURCHASER CORPORATION** , a Delaware corporation and an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Sub"); and

capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

 **A.** ** **Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have determined that it
is in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to
acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

  



  

 **B.** In furtherance of the contemplated acquisition of the Company by
Parent, it is proposed that Acquisition Sub make a tender offer to acquire
all of the issued and outstanding Company Shares upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. (Such tender offer, as it may
be amended from time to time, is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer.")

  



  

 **C**. Each Company Share accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer will be
exchanged for $35.00 (the "Per-Share Amount"), net to the seller in cash.

  



  

 **D.** It is further proposed that, after acquiring Company Shares pursuant
to the Offer, Acquisition Sub merge with and into the Company upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the merger of
Acquisition Sub into the Company being referred to in this Agreement as the
"Merger").

  



  

 **E.** In order to induce Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
certain stockholders of the Company are executing and delivering Transaction
Support Agreements with Parent and Acquisition Sub (the "Transaction Support
Agreements") and Noncompetition Agreements with Parent and the Company.

  



  

 **F.** ** **The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company have authorized and approved the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the performance by such parties of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  

   

     
   

  



  

 **G.** ** **The Board of Directors of the Company has (a) determined that
the Offer is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Companys
stockholders and (b) has resolved to recommend that the holders of Company
Shares accept the Offer and (to the extent necessary) adopt this Agreement
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

 **AGREEMENT**

  



  

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  



  

 **SECTION 1. THE OFFER**

  



  

 **1.1** ** Tender Offer**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **Unless this Agreement shall have previously been validly
terminated in accordance with Section 7, as promptly as practicable, but in
any event within ten business days after the date of this Agreement,
Acquisition Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer for all of the outstanding Company Shares (subject to
Section 5.8(c)) at a price per Company Share equal to the Per-Share Amount.
(The date on which Acquisition Sub commences the Offer, within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Commencement Date.")

  



  

 **(b)** ** **As promptly as practicable on the later of: (i) the earliest
date as of which Acquisition Sub is permitted under applicable law to accept
for payment Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn); and (ii) the earliest date as of which each of the conditions set
forth in Annex I (the "Offer Conditions") shall have been satisfied or
waived, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to)
accept for payment all Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not
validly withdrawn); _provided, however_ that the Offer may be
automatically extended from time to time in accordance with Section 1.1(d).
The obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) shall be subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Offer Conditions (and shall
not be subject to any other conditions). As promptly as possible after the
acceptance for payment of any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
(and not validly withdrawn), Acquisition Sub shall pay for such Company
Shares.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall (without the prior
written consent of the Company):

  



  

 **(i)** ** **change or waive the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I);

  



  

 **(ii)** ** **decrease the number of Company Shares sought to be
purchased by Acquisition Sub in the Offer;

  



  

 **(iii)** ** **reduce the price per share to be paid pursuant to the Offer;

  



  

 **(iv)** ** **extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the
Offer (except to the extent required pursuant to Section 1.1(d));

  



  

 **(v)** ** **change the form of consideration payable in the Offer;

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

 **(vi)** ** **amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions in any
manner adversely affecting, or that could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on, any of the holders of Company Shares;

  



  

 **(vii)** ** **impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the
Offer Conditions; or

  



  

 **(viii)** ** **amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer
in any manner adversely affecting, or that could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on, any of the holders of Company Shares.

  



  

 **(d)** ** **Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall
expire on the date (the "Initial Expiration Date") that is 20 business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act) after the Offer Commencement Date.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of
which the Offer is scheduled to expire (a "Subsequent Expiration Date"), any
Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, then the Offer and
its expiration date shall automatically be extended (and re-extended) beyond
the Initial Expiration Date or such Subsequent Expiration Date for one or
more periods of ten business days (or such other number of business days as
may be jointly determined by Acquisition Sub and the Company) per extension,
with no such period ending later than February 28, 2006, in order to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied (subject to the right of Acquisition Sub
to waive any unsatisfied Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition)
on the Initial Expiration Date or such Subsequent Expiration Date and accept
for payment Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn)). The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as
such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
Agreement), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
1.1(d), but subject to the Companys rights under Section 7.1, Acquisition
Sub may increase the price per share to be paid pursuant to the Offer and
extend the Offer to the extent required by law in connection with such
increase, in each case in its sole discretion and without the Companys
consent, provided that the Offer shall not be extended beyond February 28,
2006.

  



  

 **(e)** ** **Acquisition Sub may, in its discretion, elect to provide for a
subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act following the Acceptance Time (as
defined in Section 1.4(a)). If immediately after the Acceptance Time,
the Company Shares accepted for payment by Acquisition Sub do not represent
at least 90% of the outstanding Company Shares, then Acquisition Sub shall
provide for a subsequent offering period of at least three business days in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

 **1.2** ** Actions of Parent and Acquisition Sub**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub

staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer and give the Company

 **(a)** ** **On the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall file with the
SEC and (following or contemporaneously with the initial dissemination of the

counsel) from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company shall respond promptly to any such comments and give Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any response to

the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder; (i) each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company

this Section 1.3(a)) to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares.
 Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company

Section 1.3(a). To the extent requested by the Company, Parent shall cause

 **(b)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors may withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5.2(c).

  



  

 **(c)** ** **In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly
furnish or cause to be promptly furnished (including by instructing its
transfer agent to promptly furnish) to Acquisition Sub a list, as of a recent
date, of the record holders of Company Shares and their addresses, as well as
mailing labels containing such names and addresses. The Company will furnish
Acquisition Sub with such additional information (including lists of holders
of Company Shares, updated promptly from time to time at Acquisition Subs
request, and their addresses, mailing labels and any security
position listings in the Companys possession) and assistance as Acquisition
Sub may reasonably request for purposes of communicating the Offer to the
holders of Company Shares. Unless Parent or Acquisition Sub is required to
disclose any such information by Legal Requirements or applicable stock
exchange rules, all information furnished in accordance with this Section
1.3(c) shall be held in confidence by Parent and Acquisition Sub in
accordance with the requirements of the letter agreement, dated May 18, 2005,
between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), and shall
be used by Parent and Acquisition Sub only in connection with the
communication of the Offer and the dissemination of any proxy or information
statement relating to the Merger to the holders of Company Shares or as
necessary to enable Acquisition Sub to accept Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer, or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **1.4** ** Board of Directors**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **Following the time at which Acquisition Sub first accepts for
payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance
Time"), Parent shall be entitled to elect or designate all of the directors
on the Companys Board of Directors; _provided, however,_ that prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors shall always have at least
two Continuing Directors; _provided further,_ that (i) in no event shall the
requirement to

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

have at least two Continuing Directors result in Parents designees
constituting less than a majority of the Companys Board of Directors unless
Parent shall have failed to designate a sufficient number of directors to
constitute at least a majority and (ii) if the number of Continuing Directors
shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever (or
immediately following the Acceptance Time there are not at least two then-
existing directors of the Company who qualify to serve and are willing to
serve as Continuing Directors), then the number of Continuing Directors
required hereunder shall be reduced to the number of then-serving Continuing
Directors ( _i.e.,_ one or zero), unless any remaining Continuing Director is
able to identify a person who qualifies as a Continuing Director and
is willing to serve as a Continuing Director, in which case any such
remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled (but not required) to
designate such person to fill such vacancy, and such newly designated
director shall be deemed a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event shall Parent be entitled to designate pursuant hereto
any directors to serve on the Companys Board of Directors unless it is then
the beneficial owner of Company Shares entitling it to exercise at least a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding Company Shares. If requested
by Parent, following the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, subject to
compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, take all actions necessary
(including promptly filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the
Companys Board of Directors, promptly increasing the size of the Companys
Board of Directors (including by amending the bylaws of the Company if
necessary so as to increase such size) and/or promptly seeking the
resignations of incumbent directors) to cause persons designated by Parent to
be so elected or designated as directors of the Company.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **The Companys obligation to cause Parents designees to be
elected to or designated as members of the Companys Board of Directors shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.
The Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder
require in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.4, so long
as Parent shall have provided to the Company all information with respect to
Parent and its designees, officers, directors and Affiliates required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder.  Parent shall
promptly supply to the Company in writing, and shall be solely responsible
for, all such information.

  



  

 **1.5** ** Actions by Directors**. Following the election or designation of
Parents designees to the Companys Board of Directors pursuant to Section
1.4(a), and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the
Continuing Directors shall (in addition to any approval rights of the
Companys Board of Directors or its stockholders required by law) be required
to authorize (i) any amendment to or termination of this Agreement by the
Company, (ii) any amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation or
bylaws, (iii) any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub if such extension
adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on, any of the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent or Acquisition
Sub), (iv) any waiver of compliance with any covenant of Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any condition to any obligation of the Company, or any
waiver of any right of the Company under this Agreement, if such waiver
adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on, any of the

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

holders of Company Shares (other than Parent or Acquisition Sub), (v) any
withdrawal, modification, amendment or qualification by the Companys Board
of Directors of the Company Board Recommendation, and (vi) any other consent
or action by the Companys Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement
or the Merger if such consent or action adversely affects, or could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on, any of the holders of
Company Shares (other than Parent or Acquisition Sub); _provided, however_ ,
that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such persons
deaths, disabilities, refusal to serve or otherwise, then such actions may be
effected by majority vote of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Certificates previously representing such Company Shares in exchange for
payment therefor. Parent shall ensure that, upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of each such Company Stock Certificate, together with a properly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate
(or, under the circumstances described in Section 2.7(e), the transferee of

required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes relating to such transfer
have been paid.

9   

     
   

  



  

 **2.8** ** Appraisal Rights.**

  



  

 **(a)** ** **Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any Company Shares that constitute Appraisal Shares (as defined in
Section 2.8(c)) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
payment in accordance with Section 2.5, and each holder of Appraisal Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such Appraisal Shares
as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. From
and after the Effective Time, a holder of Appraisal Shares shall not have and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of
a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. If any holder of Appraisal
Shares shall fail to perfect or shall otherwise lose such holders right of
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) any right of such holder to
require the Surviving Corporation to purchase such Appraisal Shares for cash
shall be extinguished, and (ii) such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be
converted into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the
surrender of the Company Stock Certificate(s) previously representing such
Appraisal Shares) payment for such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section
2.5(c).

  



  

 **(b)** ** **The Company (i) shall give Parent written notice of any demand
by any stockholder of the Company for appraisal of such stockholders Company
Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand. The Company shall not make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
appraisal without the consent of Parent.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **For purposes of this Agreement, "Appraisal Shares" shall refer
to any Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by stockholders who have preserved their appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Company Shares.

  



  

 **2.9** ** ****Further Action**. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (in
the name of Acquisition Sub, in the name of the Company or otherwise) take
such action.

"Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the numbered section of this
Section 3 that includes a particular representation or warranty, or (c) in
any other part of the Company Disclosure Schedule where it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure or the context in which such

lessor thereunder, enforceable by the Company or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, there is no default under any Company Lease nor any condition or
event, which, after notice or a lapse of time or both would constitute
a default under any Company Lease (nor has the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries received, between January 1, 2003 and the date of this

 **(c)** ** **to the Companys knowledge, no investigation by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or is being threatened, other than any investigations that would not
reasonably be expected by the Company to result in restrictions on the

to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

 **3.11** ** Governmental Authorizations.**

  



  

 **(a)** ** **As of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all Governmental Authorizations necessary to enable them to
conduct their businesses in the manner in which such businesses are currently
being conducted, except where failure to hold such Governmental
Authorizations would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As of the date of this Agreement, such Governmental
Authorizations are, in all material respects, valid and in full force and
effect and the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms and requirements of such Governmental Authorizations.
Between January 1, 2003 and the date of this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries received any written notice from any Governmental
Entity (i) asserting any material violation of any term or requirement of any
material Governmental Authorization except where such notice has been
withdrawn or where the violation asserted in such notice is otherwise no
longer pending or where the violation asserted in such notice has been cured
or otherwise resolved in all material respects or (ii) notifying the Company
or one of its Subsidiaries of the revocation of any material Governmental
Authorization except where such notice has been withdrawn or is otherwise no

matters, including the international traffic in arms regulations ("ITAR") and
the export administration regulations (collectively, the "Export Control
Laws"). The Company possesses all Governmental Authorizations required under
Export Control Laws for its business as conducted as of the date of this
Agreement. Copies or descriptions of the Companys access control policies
and procedures as of the date of this Agreement with respect to facilities
manufacturing or assembling "defense articles" under Export Control Laws have
been delivered or otherwise made available to Parent. Part 3.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth (i) all facility security clearances
issued by any Governmental Entity (including the DSS) held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii)
the approximate number of Company Employees who hold personnel security
clearances issued by any Governmental Entity as of the date of this
Agreement. The Company and (to the Companys knowledge) such Company
Employees are in compliance in all material respects with the terms of such
facility and personnel security clearances. As of the date

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

of this Agreement, the Company maintains all security clearances required
to conduct its business as currently operated.  Neither the acceptance for
payment of any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, nor the
consummation of the Merger, will result in the revocation of any security
clearance of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company except for such
security clearances that could be revoked if an Agreed Arrangement were not
implemented or if any other measures required to effectively insulate against
foreign ownership, control or influence were not obtained, and provided that
no representation or warranty is made with respect to any facts or
circumstances unique to or otherwise relating to Parent or Acquisition Sub.

nor any of its Subsidiaries received any notice from any U.S. Governmental

Control Law or (ii) notifying the Company or one of its Subsidiaries of the
revocation of (A) any applicable Governmental Authorization required under
Export Control Laws or (B) any security facility or personnel clearances
issued by U.S. Governmental Entities except in each case where such notice
has been withdrawn or is otherwise no longer pending, where such Governmental
Authorization has been reinstated in all material respects or where the
violation or other matter asserted in such notice has been cured or otherwise
resolved in all material respects.

corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization.

  



  

 **4.2** ** Legal Proceedings.** As of the date of this Agreement:

Parent, being threatened) against Parent or Acquisition Sub that would
materially and adversely affect Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



  

 **(b)** ** **there is no court order or judgment to which Parent or
Acquisition Sub is subject that would materially and adversely affect
Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to consummate any of the transactions

29   

     
   

  



  

 **(c)** ** **no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent is pending or, to
Parents knowledge, threatened, other than any investigation that would not
materially and adversely affect Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **4.3** ** Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement.** Parent has the
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.  The Board of Directors of Parent has (a)
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by
Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize
this Agreement.  This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its
terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency and the relief of debtors, and (ii) rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

of the appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL. The
sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub will vote to adopt this Agreement (or
take such other appropriate actions in the case of a merger pursuant to
Section 253 of the DGCL) immediately after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company, constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Acquisition Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general
application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and
(ii) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies.

  



  

 **4.4** ** Non-Contravention; Consents.** Except in the case of clauses
"(b)" and "(c)" for violations and defaults that would not materially and
adversely affect Parents or Acquisition Subs ability to consummate any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub, the acquisition of
Company Shares by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer and the consummation
by Acquisition Sub of the Merger will not: (a) cause a violation of, or
conflict with, any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Parent or Acquisition Sub; (b) cause a violation by,

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

Parent or Acquisition Sub, or conflict with, of any Legal Requirement
applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub; or (c) cause a breach or default on
the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under any material contract by which it
is bound. Except as may be required by the Exchange Act, the DGCL, the HSR

forth in Section 4.4 of the disclosure schedule delivered to the Company on
the date of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub, nor any of Parents other Affiliates, is required to
make any filing with or to obtain any consent, approval authorization or
permit from any Person, domestic or foreign, at or prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub or the consummation by Parent or
Acquisition Sub of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
which if not made or received, (a) would be materially adverse to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (b) would prevent or materially
delay acceptance for payment of the Company Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer or the consummation of the Merger. No vote of Parents stockholders is
necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **4.5** ** Not an Interested Stockholder**. Neither Parent nor any of its

Parents Affiliates directly or indirectly owns, and at all times since

fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

  



  

 **4.9** ** ****Information in Schedule 14D-9**.  None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time the

time at or prior to the Acceptance Time, contain any untrue statement of a

the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of such meeting of
Company stockholders described in Section 5.3 (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

of furnishing confidential information) or knowingly encourage the submission
of a proposal that constitutes, or any inquiry or proposal that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Acquisition Proposal made
by any Person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives (any such Person, a "Third Party"); (ii) enter into with any
Third Party any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than any
confidentiality agreement of the type referred to in clause "(3)" of
the proviso to this sentence below) that contemplates an Alternative
Acquisition (as defined in Section 5.2(f)(i)) by such Third Party (or by any

Agreement; or (iii) continue or otherwise engage in any negotiations with a
Third Party or a Third Partys Representatives concerning, or provide any
confidential information regarding the Company to any Third Party or a Third
Partys Representatives with respect to, an Alternative Acquisition Proposal
made by such Third Party; _provided, however_ ,

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
the respective Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries may engage
in any such negotiations and provide any such information as described in
clause "(iii)" of this sentence in response to an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a breach of clause "(i)"
of this sentence if (1) such Alternative Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and the
Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to engage in any such negotiations with or
provide any such information to such Third Party or such Third Partys
Representatives would be reasonably likely to result in a breach by
the Companys Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders, (2) at least 24 hours prior to initiating any negotiations
with such Third Party or such Third Partys Representatives concerning, or
initially providing any confidential information regarding the Company to
such Third Party or such Third Partys Representatives in response to, such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal, the Company gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such Third Party and of the Companys intention to engage in
negotiations with, or furnish confidential information to, such Third Party
or such Third Partys Representatives, (3) prior to providing any
confidential information regarding the Company to such Third Party or such
Third Partys Representatives in response to such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal, the Company receives from such Third Party an
executed confidentiality agreement containing limitations on the use and
disclosure of confidential information furnished to such Third Party and such
Third Partys Representatives by the Company that are no less favorable to
the Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
(and provided that such confidentiality agreement with such Third Party shall
not contain restrictions that would prevent the Company from complying with
its obligations to provide required disclosure to Parent under this Section
5.2), and (4) prior to or contemporaneously with providing any confidential
information (whether initially or pursuant to subsequent deliveries of
confidential information) to such Third Party or such Third
Partys Representatives, the Company furnishes or otherwise makes the same
such confidential information available to Parent (to the extent such
confidential information has not been previously furnished or otherwise made
available to Parent). Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
negotiations with any Third Party relating to any Alternative
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company will not be responsible for, and will not be
deemed to have breached this Agreement by virtue of, any actions by its or
its Subsidiaries employees that have not been authorized by the
Companys senior management.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company
from a Third Party of any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
proposal that the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and
in any case within one business day after the Companys receipt thereof and
prior to engaging in any negotiations with, or providing any confidential
information to, such Third Party or such Third Partys Representatives,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of (i) such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry or proposal, (ii) the
identity of such Third Party, and (iii) the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry or proposal (including
any amendments or

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

modifications thereto). The Company shall (A) keep Parent reasonably informed
on a current basis of, and upon Parents request promptly update Parent on,
the status of any such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, including any
ongoing discussions or negotiations with the applicable Third Party with
respect thereto, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of any
such Alternative Acquisition Proposal, and (B) promptly (and no later than 24
hours after sending, and no later than one business day after receiving, such
written communications or materials, as applicable) provide Parent with
copies of all material written correspondence or other material written
communications or materials (other than (without limiting the Companys
obligations under clause "(4)" of the proviso to the first sentence of
Section 5.2(a)) due diligence materials) sent or provided to or by
the Company and its Representatives from or to the applicable Third Party and
its Representatives relating to the material terms and conditions of any
such Alternative Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation, or make any public statement
inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation (any of the foregoing, a
"Change in Recommendation"), (ii) fail to recommend against acceptance of a
publicly announced tender offer that constitutes an Alternative Acquisition
Proposal (and that remains pending) within ten business days after the
Company receives a written request from Parent to recommend against such
tender offer (provided that Parent shall not make such a request on more than
one occasion with respect to any particular tender offer where the offer
price and other material terms of such tender offer have not changed) or
(iii) fail to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten business
days after the Company receives a written request from Parent to do so if
Parent makes such request promptly following the public announcement by a
Third Party of an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (provided that Parent may
not make such a request on more than one occasion with respect to any
particular Alternative Acquisition Proposal where the price and other
material terms of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal have not changed),
unless, in the case of clause "(i)," clause "(ii)" or clause "(iii)" of this
sentence, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that failure to do so (i.e., that failing
to make a Change of Recommendation, that recommending against acceptance of a
tender offer in the circumstances described in clause "(ii)" of this
sentence, or that reconfirming the Company Board Recommendation in
the circumstances described in clause "(iii)" of this sentence) would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach by the Companys Board of Directors
of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders (A) by reason of there
being pending an Alternative Acquisition Proposal, (B) by reason of there
having been a favorable change in the circumstances of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries occurring after the date of this Agreement (or of which
the Company first obtains knowledge after the date of this Agreement) that
could be material to the decision of a holder of Company Shares as to whether
to tender such Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or as to whether to vote
to adopt this Agreement, or (C) for any other reason that could be material
to any such decision of a holder of Company Shares.

  



  

 **(d)** ** **Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall approve or recommend any Alternative Acquisition Proposal by a
Third Party or cause or permit the Company to enter into with any Third Party
any letter of intent, memorandum of

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement
or understanding (other than any confidentiality agreement of the type
referred to in clause "(3)" of the proviso to the first sentence of Section
5.2(a)) providing for any Alternative Acquisition by such Third Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company may, in response to a Designated Superior Proposal
(as defined in Section 5.2(f)(iii)), take any of the actions described in the
first sentence of this Section 5.2(d) (collectively, "Specified Actions");
_provided, however_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take
any Specified Action unless (i) the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that taking such
Specified Action is not inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
first provided prior written notice to Parent that it intends to take a
Specified Action in response to a Designated Superior Proposal (a "Notice of
Designated Superior Proposal"), which notice shall attach the most
current form or draft of any written agreement providing for the
Alternative Acquisition contemplated by such Designated Superior Proposal and
(iii) Parent does not make, during the period commencing upon the receipt of
such Notice of Designated Superior Proposal and ending five business days
thereafter (the "Matching Period"), a binding, unconditional written offer
(including the complete form of definitive acquisition agreement executed on
behalf of Parent and all exhibits and other attachments thereto, subject to
acceptance by the Company by countersignature on behalf of the Company, and
subject to no other conditions whatsoever) that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation, is at least as favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company as such Designated
Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that, during the Matching Period, the
Company and its Representatives shall negotiate with Parent in good faith
with respect to possible revisions to the terms of this Agreement if
any proposed revisions to the terms of this Agreement are offered in writing
by Parent to the Company. The Company further agrees that it will deliver to
Parent a new Notice of Designated Superior Proposal with respect to (A) each
material revision or material modification to a Designated Superior Proposal
that was the subject of a previous Notice of Designated Superior Proposal
where such revision or modification is adverse to the Company or its
stockholders, and (B) each other material revision or material modification
to a Designated Superior Proposal that was the subject of a previous Notice
of Designated Superior Proposal where such revision or modification is made
during a Matching Period, and that a new Matching Period shall commence for
purposes of this Section 5.2(d) under either of the circumstances described
in clauses "(A)" and "(B)" above at the time Parent receives the new Notice
of Designated Superior Proposal; _provided, however_ , that any such new
Matching Period shall be only three business days in duration.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to enter into any definitive agreement
contemplating any Designated Superior Proposal unless this Agreement has
been, or concurrently is, terminated by its terms pursuant to Section 7.1 and
the Company has paid, or concurrently with the entering into of such
definitive agreement pays, by cashiers check, or otherwise by immediately
available funds, any termination fee due to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3.

  



  

 **(e)** ** **Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from complying
with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or from furnishing
a copy or excerpts of this Agreement to any Third Party (or to any
Representative of any Third Party) that makes any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or that makes any inquiry that could lead to an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

 **(f)** ** **For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

 **(i)** ** **"Alternative Acquisition" shall mean any tender or exchange
offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
other transaction that would result in the direct or indirect acquisition by
any Third Party of 20% or more of the capital stock of the Company or of 20%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions.

  



  

 **(ii)** ** **"Alternative Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any written
proposal or offer for an Alternative Acquisition.

  



  

 **(iii)** ** **"Designated Superior Proposal" shall mean any Superior
Proposal that either (A) would result in the direct or indirect acquisition
by any Third Party of 90% or more of the capital stock of the Company or of
90% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or (B) contemplates the delivery to the Company or the stockholders of the
Company of aggregate consideration that is determined in good faith by the
Companys Board of Directors, after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, to be valued at more than the dollar amount
determined by multiplying the Per-Share Amount by the number of Company
Shares outstanding as of the date such Superior Proposal is made.

  



  

 **(iv)** ** **"Superior Proposal" shall mean any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal that (A) would result in the direct or indirect acquisition by any
Third Party of 50% or more of the capital stock of the Company or of 50% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B)
is determined in good faith by the Companys Board of Directors, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
(1) to contemplate an Alternative Acquisition that if consummated would be
more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from a financial point of view, taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this
Agreement (including any binding, unconditional offer by Parent to amend the
terms of this Agreement which includes the complete form of
definitive acquisition agreement executed on behalf of Parent and all
exhibits and other attachments thereto, subject to acceptance by the Company
by countersignature on behalf of the Company, and subject to no other
conditions whatsoever), and (2) to be reasonably capable of being consummated
on the terms so proposed.

  



  

 **5.3** ** Meeting of the Companys Stockholders**. If required following
the purchase of Company Shares by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer, or
the expiration of any subsequent offering period provided for in accordance
with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, the Company will (subject to
applicable Legal Requirements and the requirements of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws) take all action necessary to convene a meeting of
holders of Company Shares to vote upon the Merger. The Board of Directors of
the Company shall

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

recommend adoption of this Agreement, and the Company shall take all lawful
action to solicit such adoption, except to the extent that the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that to do so would be reasonably likely to result in
a breach by the Companys Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Companys Board of Directors may withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify any recommendation that the Companys stockholders adopt
this Agreement if it determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify such recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach
by the Companys Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders. At any such meeting of holders of Company Shares,
Parent shall ensure that all Company Shares owned beneficially or of record
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of Parents other Affiliates will be voted
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Parent will furnish to the Company
all information regarding Parent and its Affiliates that may be required
(pursuant to the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements) to be
set forth in the Companys proxy or information statement with respect to
such meeting (the "Proxy Statement"). The Company will not file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC, and will not amend or supplement the Proxy Statement,
without consulting Parent and its counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if, at any time after the purchase of
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer by Acquisition Sub, the Company Shares
beneficially owned by Acquisition Sub, together with any Company Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and Parents other Affiliates, shall
collectively represent at least 90% of the outstanding Company Shares, then
Parent shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to cause the Merger
to become effective as soon as practicable without a meeting of the Companys
stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  



  

 **5.4** ** Filings; Other Action**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i)
promptly make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions required
to be made or effected by it pursuant to the HSR Act, the Exchange Act and
other applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Offer and the Merger;
and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be taken, on a
timely basis, all actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
consummating and effectuating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub (A) shall promptly provide all
information requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (B) shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
take, and cause its Affiliates to promptly take, all actions and steps
necessary to obtain any clearance or approval required to be obtained from
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S.
Department of State, CFIUS, the DoD, the DSS, any state attorney general, any
foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **Each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt
notice upon obtaining knowledge of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other
parties informed as to the status of any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

Proceeding, and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication
to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice
or any other Governmental Entity (including the U.S. Department of State,
CFIUS, the DoD and the DSS) regarding the Offer or the Merger or Parents
ownership or operation of the Company or its business following
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties and will
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or
proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition, except as may
be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Legal Requirement, each
party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to
be present at each meeting or conference with representatives of any
Governmental Entity relating to any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in
connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **The Company and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cooperate
fully with each other as requested by the other parties in connection with
the process (including with respect to providing information and scheduling
or conducting conference calls and meetings) of obtaining any
Governmental Authorization or other approval or making any notification
pursuant to Export Control Laws in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **(d)** ** **Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all Offer Conditions to be satisfied on a timely
basis (to the extent the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions is within
Parents or Acquisition Subs direct or indirect control) and to cause
Acquisition Sub to purchase all Company Shares tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer on the earliest possible date.

  



  

 **(e)** ** **In no event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub be obligated
pursuant to this Section 5.4 to divest or "hold separate" any assets or to
implement any Security Arrangement that would impose limitations on the
ownership or operation by Parent or Acquisition Sub of (i) all or a portion
of its business or assets, or (ii) the shares of capital stock of Acquisition
Sub or the Surviving Corporation; _provided, however_ , that Parent and
Acquisition Sub agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement: (A) in connection with obtaining the Specified
Governmental Clearances, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be obligated to
agree to and to implement (and to permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to
agree to and to implement) any Agreed Arrangement, to the extent such Agreed
Arrangement is imposed by any Governmental Entity in connection with or as a
condition or prerequisite to granting any Specified Governmental Clearance;
and (B) in order to satisfy any requirement imposed by any Governmental
Entity other than the DoD or the DSS in connection with or as a condition or
prerequisite to granting any consent, approval or clearance or otherwise,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be obligated to agree to and to take (and to
permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to agree to and to take) any other
actions that impose limitations, burdens or restraints on the business,
operations or assets of the Company or the Surviving Corporation if such
limitations, burdens or restraints are not material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Security Arrangement" shall mean
a technology control plan, special security arrangement, voting trust

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

arrangement, proxy arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement with
respect to any assets, personnel or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities of any Subsidiary of the Company in connection
with approvals by the DoD, CFIUS or other Governmental Entity (including in
respect of acquisitions of U.S. government contractors handling classified
information and related material).

  



  

 **5.5** ** Access**. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford
Parents Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Acceptance Time, to the Companys books
and records and information, its properties and facilities and its personnel
(including finance staff and accountants) and, during such period, the
Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such readily available information
concerning the Companys business as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required to permit
any inspection or other access, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company would (a) violate any obligation of
the Company with respect to confidentiality (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any confidentiality obligation of the Company pursuant to
any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company in accordance with
clause "(3)" of the proviso to this first sentence of Section 5.2(a) in
connection with any Alternative Acquisition Proposal), (b) jeopardize
protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine or (c) violate any Legal Requirement. All
information obtained by Parent and its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 5.5 shall be treated as "Confidential Information" for purposes of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

 **5.6** ** ****Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub.** During the
period between the date of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Merger, Acquisition Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature
except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **5.7** ** Publicity**. The parties hereto shall (a) consult with each other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any Governmental Entity with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that the Company
need not consult with Parent in connection with any press release or public
statement to be issued or made with respect to any Alternative Acquisition
Proposal or with respect to any withdrawal of, modification to, amendment of
or qualification to the Company Board Recommendation), and (b) give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the other party being consulted and use commercially
reasonable efforts to come to an agreement with the other party being
consulted regarding specific wording of any such press release or public
announcement, except in each case (i) as may be required by any Legal
Requirement or by any listing agreement or the listing rules of a national
securities exchange or (ii) as determined by the party making such disclosure
in good faith, for disclosures relating to the effects of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the financial results of the disclosing
party in connection with any announcement or public reporting of financial
results by such party.

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

 **5.8** ** Stock Options; Restricted Stock**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that (i)
each unexercised and unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time shall become vested in accordance with the terms of the
Company Option Plan, and (ii) in accordance with the Company Option Plan,
each unexercised Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive, at the Effective Time in
consideration for such cancellation, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the amount by
which the Per-Share Amount (or such greater cash amount per Company Share as
may have been paid to any holder of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer)
exceeds the exercise price per share of Company Shares subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that each
outstanding Company Share outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time that constitutes unvested restricted stock of the Company shall become
vested in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plan, with the
result that no such Company Share shall remain subject to repurchase rights
in favor of the Company following the Acceptance Time.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **It is agreed that, by virtue of the restrictions on transfer
applicable to Company Shares that constitute unvested restricted stock of the
Company, no such Company Shares can be validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
at or prior to the Acceptance Time.

  



  

 **5.9** ** Other Employee Benefits**.

  



  

 **(a)** ** **Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Company or the Surviving Corporation
after the Acceptance Time (a "Continuing Employee") shall be provided, for a
period extending until at least the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
with (i) an annual salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and annual cash
bonus opportunities that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to such
Continuing Employee than the salary or hourly wage rate and annual cash
bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or
the relevant Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time, and (ii) continuation of coverage under the Companys or the relevant
Subsidiarys tax qualified and welfare benefit plans and arrangements, or
alternatively, benefits under a different plan or plans; _provided, however_
, that in each case such benefits shall be substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance Time,
excluding any equity-based plans, programs or arrangements. Nothing in this
Agreement (A) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to continue to employ any
particular Company Employee following the Effective Time, or (B) shall be
construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any Company Benefit
Plan.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **Parent shall ensure that, as of the Effective Time, each
Continuing Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits, but excluding benefit accrual) for service with the

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

Company or its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company provides such past service credit) under each of the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, in which such Continuing Employee becomes
a participant; _provided, however_ , that no such service recognition
shall result in any duplication of benefits.  As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit to
Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had
accrued under any applicable Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of any Continuing Employees,
subject only to any required approval of the applicable insurance provider,
if any, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods,
any evidence of insurability requirements and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitations under such plan, and (ii) cause each
Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid
by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the
plan year that includes the Effective Time for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and
honor in accordance with their terms all deferred compensation plans,
agreements and arrangements, severance and separation pay plans, agreements
and arrangements, and written employment, severance, retention, incentive,
change in control and termination agreements (including any change in control
provisions therein) set forth in Part 5.9(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule applicable to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in the
same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to
perform and honor such plans, agreements and arrangements if the Merger had
not been consummated.

  



  

 **5.10** ** Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.**

  



  

 **(a)** ** **From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent will cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement
identified in Part 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect
to indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws on the date of this
Agreement, and, from and after the Acceptance Time, such provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **Without limiting the provisions of Section 5.10(a), during the
period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, (i) without limiting the rights of any Indemnified
Party under clause "(ii)" of this sentence, the Company (and from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall, and Parent shall cause
the Company and the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless
each

  



  

44   

      
  

  



  

Indemnified Party (in each case to the fullest extent provided or permitted
by the terms of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, to the fullest extent provided or permitted by the
terms of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company and to the
fullest extent provided or permitted by the terms of any indemnification
agreements or arrangements with any such Indemnified Party) against and from
any costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (the foregoing, "Losses") in
connection with any claim, Legal Proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such
claim, Legal Proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or
indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, at or after
the Acceptance Time), and (ii) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party against any Losses in connection with any claim,
Legal Proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, Legal Proceeding,
investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the
Company, to the Surviving Corporation or to Parent, as applicable, a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 5.10(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

  



  

 **(c)** ** **From the Acceptance Time through the third anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of directors
and officers liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance policy in effect as of
the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that (i) in no event shall
Parent be required pursuant to this Section 5.10(c) to expend in any one year
an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently payable by the
Company with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the
annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to such amount, and (ii) in lieu of the foregoing,
and notwithstanding anything contained in clause "(i)" above, the Company may
obtain a prepaid tail policy (the "Tail Policy") prior to the Acceptance
Time, which policy provides Indemnified Persons with directors and officers
liability insurance for a period ending no earlier than the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, provided that the aggregate premium for the Tail
Policy shall not exceed $1,300,000. Except as permitted by the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.10(c), the Company shall not purchase
any directors and officers liability insurance, including any Tail Policy,
on or after the date of this Agreement without the written approval of
Parent, except in connection with any expiration of the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance policy (it being understood
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
upon the expiration of the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policy, the Company may replace such policy with a policy
having substantially the same level and scope of coverage).

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

 **(d)** ** **This Section 5.10 shall survive the Acceptance Time and shall
also survive consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time. This Section
5.10 is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other similar
transaction involving Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or in the event of
any sale by Parent or the Surviving Corporation of all or substantially all
of its assets, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall ensure that Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and any acquiring corporation or successor
Entity remain responsible for the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.10.

  



  

 **(e)** ** **For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was
an officer or director of the Company at or at or at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time shall be deemed to be an "Indemnified Party."

  



  

 **5.11** ** Stockholder Litigation** **.  **The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether commenced prior to
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, provided that (subject
to the following sentence) the Company shall control such defense and
settlement, and in no event shall Parent have the right or power to settle
such litigation. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or make an offer
to settle any litigation commenced against the Company or any of its
directors by any stockholder of the Company relating to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or
by the Transaction Support Agreements, without the prior written consent of
Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

 **5.12** ** ****Notification of Certain Matters** **.**

  



  

 **(a)** ** **The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of the discovery
of any material fact or circumstance that, or the discovery of the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any material event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would cause (i) any material representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material respect as of
the time originally made, or (ii) any material failure of the Company to
comply with any material covenant required to be complied with by it under
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notice shall affect the
representations or warranties of the Company or the conditions to the
performance by Parent and Acquisition Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement. In addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of the
Companys discovery of any material fact or circumstance that would cause any
material representation of the Company qualified by knowledge contained in
this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material respect as of the time
originally made if such representation were to have been made without the
knowledge qualifier as of the time originally made. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the failure of the Company to
deliver any notice required pursuant to this Section 5.12(a), nor any delay
in the delivery of any such notice, shall be considered in
determining whether the Offer Condition set forth in clause "(c)" of Annex I
has been satisfied or whether the termination right in Section 7.1(i)
is available to Parent, unless such failure or delay was the result of a
willful decision made by an executive officer of the

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

Company who had knowledge of the information required to be delivered to
Parent pursuant to this Section 5.12(a) and who had knowledge of the
applicability of this Section 5.12(a) to such information.

  



  

 **(b)** ** **Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of the discovery
of any material fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any material event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which,
would cause (i) any material representation or warranty of Parent or
Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material
respect, or (ii) any material failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply
with any material covenant required to be complied with by it under this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such notice shall affect
the representations or warranties of Parent or Acquisition Sub or the
conditions to the performance by the Company of its obligations under this
Agreement. In addition, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of
Parents discovery of any material fact or circumstance that would cause any
material representation of Parent or Acquisition Sub qualified by knowledge
contained in this Agreement to be inaccurate in any material respect as of
the time originally made if such representation were to have been made
without the knowledge qualifier as of the time originally made.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
failure of Parent to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 5.12(b), nor
any delay in the delivery of any such notice, shall be considered in
determining whether the termination right in Section 7.1(j) is available to
the Company, unless such failure or delay was the result of a
willful decision made by an executive officer of Parent who had knowledge of
the information required to be delivered to the Company pursuant to this
Section 5.12(b) and who had knowledge of the applicability of this Section
5.12(b) to such information.

  



  

 **5.13** ** Third Party Consents and Notification.** The Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain all required consents,
and shall make all required notifications, prior to the Acceptance Time under
third party contracts and agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall (i) consult with Parent prior to seeking
any such consent or making any such notification and (ii) shall not, without
Parents consent, pay any amounts, or otherwise relinquish any economic
right, to obtain any such consent.

  



  

 **SECTION 6. CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTYS OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER**

  



  

The obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions prior to the Effective
Time:

  



  

 **6.1** ** Stockholder Approval**. If adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of Company Shares is required by applicable law, this Agreement shall
have been adopted by the requisite vote of such holders.

  



  

 **6.2** ** No Injunctions; Laws**. No injunction shall have been issued by
a court of competent jurisdiction and shall be continuing that prohibits the
consummation of the Merger, and no law shall have been enacted since the date
of this Agreement and shall remain in effect

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

that prohibits the consummation of the Merger; _provided, however_ , that

the stockholders of the Company):

  



  

 **(a)** ** **by mutual consent of the Company and Parent at any time prior

 **(b)** ** **by the Company if Acquisition Sub shall have failed to commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within
ten business days after the date of this Agreement, provided that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available
to the Company if its failure to comply with any of its covenants under
this Agreement has resulted in the failure of the commencement of the Offer;

  



  

 **(c)** ** **by Parent or the Company at any time after February 28, 2006
and prior to the Acceptance Time if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before February 28, 2006 (provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any
party where the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such Party) to
comply with any of its covenants under this Agreement has resulted in the
failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before February
28, 2006);

  



  

 **(d)** ** **by Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time if (i) there shall be any Legal Requirement enacted by the United
States, by any state of the United States or by any Significant Jurisdiction
after the date of this Agreement and remaining in effect that makes the
acceptance for payment of the Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer
illegal or that prohibits the Merger, or any court of competent jurisdiction
in the United States or any Significant Jurisdiction shall have issued a
permanent injunction prohibiting the acceptance for payment of the Company
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the
Merger and such injunction shall have become final and non-appealable, (ii)
with respect to any Legal Requirement of the type referred to in clause "(i)"
of this sentence enacted after the date of this Agreement by any
other jurisdiction, or any final and non-appealable permanent injunction of
the type referred to in clause "(i)" of this sentence issued after the date
of this Agreement by any other court of competent jurisdiction, the violation
of such Legal Requirement or injunction that would occur if the Company
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer were accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer or if the Merger were consummated would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) any event
(including any final and non-appealable determination by any Governmental
Entity in the United States or in any Significant Jurisdiction with respect
to any approval required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) shall have occurred such that any of the conditions set forth
on Annex I that

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

have not been waived shall become impossible to be satisfied on or prior to
February 28, 2006; _provided, however,_ that a party shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if the issuance
of any such injunction or the occurrence of such event is attributable to the
failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to comply with any of
the covenants in this Agreement required to be complied with by such party
(or any Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

  



  

 **(e)** ** **by Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) expires as a result of the non-
satisfaction of one or more Offer Conditions, or is terminated or withdrawn
prior to the Acceptance Time, without Acquisition Sub having accepted for
payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer; _provided,
however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if the non-satisfaction of any Offer
Condition or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer is attributable to
the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to comply with any
of the covenants in this Agreement required to be complied with by such party
(or any Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

  



  

 **(f)** ** **by Parent if (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall have
made a Change in Recommendation, (ii) the Companys Board of Directors shall
have taken any Specified Action, (iii) the Companys Board of Directors shall
have failed to recommend against acceptance of a publicly announced tender
offer that constitutes an Alternative Acquisition Proposal (and that remains
pending) within ten business days after the Company receives a written
request from Parent to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer
(provided that (x) Parent shall not make such a request on more than one
occasion with respect to any particular tender offer where the offer price
and other material terms of such tender offer remain unchanged and (y) any
recommendation by the Companys Board of Directors against acceptance of such
tender offer shall not limit the rights of the Companys Board of Directors
under Section 5.2 with respect to subsequent Alternative Acquisition
Proposals, or amended versions of Alternative Acquisition Proposals, that
were not solicited in violation of clause "(i)" of the first sentence of
Section 5.2(a)), (iv) the Companys Board of Directors shall have failed to
recommend rejection of a publicly announced Alternative Acquisition Proposal
(that remains pending) within 20 business days after the Company receives a
written request from Parent to recommend rejection of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (provided that (x) Parent shall not make such a request
on more than one occasion with respect to any particular Alternative
Acquisition Proposal where the price and other material terms of such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal remain unchanged and (y) any recommendation
by the Companys Board of Directors in favor of rejection of such Alternative
Acquisition Proposal shall not limit the rights of the Companys Board of
Directors under Section 5.2 with respect to subsequent Alternative
Acquisition Proposals, or amended versions of Alternative Acquisition
Proposals, that were not solicited in violation of clause "(i)" of the first
sentence of Section 5.2(a)), (v) the Companys Board of Directors shall have
failed to reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten business days
after the Company receives a written request from Parent to do so promptly
following the public announcement by a Third Party of an Alternative
Acquisition Proposal (provided that (x)

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

Parent may not make such a request on more than one occasion with respect to
any particular Alternative Acquisition Proposal where the price and other
material terms of such Alternative Acquisition Proposal remain unchanged and

Board of Directors under Section 5.2 with respect to Alternative Acquisition
Proposals, or amended versions of Alternative Acquisition Proposals, that
were not solicited in violation of clause "(i)" of the first sentence of
Section 5.2(a)), or (vi) the Company shall have committed a willful and
material breach of its covenant set forth in clause "(i)" of the first
sentence of Section 5.2(a); _provided, however_ , that: (A) with respect to
clause "(i)" above, Parents right to terminate this Agreement shall expire
