Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person
(other than the Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates or otherwise
related parties). The Indemnified Party may participate in (but in no
case control) any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_; _provided that_
, the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to
any such participation. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification under this  _Article 8_) in regard to the Third Party Claim, with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), and by all appropriate proceedings (which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party). In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought under this _Article 8_ without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this  _Section 8.3(c)_, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to any such participation. 

   

 (d) Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Losses that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware, or should have become aware through the exercise of reasonable and diligent inquiry, of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, include copies of all available material written evidence thereof, and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of damages that have been sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of five (5) Business Days to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such five (5) Business Day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party under the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
