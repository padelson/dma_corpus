accounting or Tax elections or adjustments made at or subsequent to the
Closing.

 

(iii) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to Seller a schedule setting forth the final Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ ") and the components
thereof (the " _Working Capital Adjustment Statement_ ").

 

(iv) Buyer shall provide Seller with all reasonable access during normal
business hours to the working papers, accounting and other books and records
of the Rangeland Entities to the extent required to review Buyers preparation
of the Working Capital Adjustment Statement.

(v) The Working Capital Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding
upon the Parties on the date that is 30 days after the date of delivery
thereof by Buyer unless Seller gives written notice of its bona fide
disagreement (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer prior to such date, in which
case such Working Capital Adjustment Statement (as so adjusted pursuant to
this _Section 2.5_) shall become final and binding on the earlier of (A) the
date upon which Seller and Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters
specified in the Dispute Notice and (B) the date upon which the Final
Statement is issued by the Expert (as defined below).

 

(vi) Any Dispute Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the item, dollar
amount, and basis of any disagreement asserted together with supporting
documentation and other data as is reasonably necessary to provide
substantiation thereof.

(b) _Dispute Resolution_.

(i) During the 15 days following the date upon which Buyer receives a Dispute
Notice, Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in the
Dispute Notice. If at the end of such 15-day period (or earlier by mutual
agreement) Buyer and Seller have not reached agreement on all such matters,
Buyer and Seller may mutually agree to extend the time to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to all matters specified in
the Dispute Notice. In the absence of any such extension or upon the
termination of any such

 



18  extension without any additional extensions, the matters that remain in
dispute may be submitted by either Party to Grant Thornton LLP (or, if Grant
Thornton LLP is not willing or able to serve in such capacity, a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm agreed to by the Parties in writing)
(the " _Expert_ ") for review and resolution.

 

(ii) Not more than 5 days after either Party has submitted such remaining
disputed matters to the Expert for resolution, each Party shall submit to the
Expert any supporting materials and calculations with regard to any amounts in
dispute in the Working Capital Adjustment Statement. The Expert shall render a
decision resolving the matters within 30 days thereafter, unless the Parties
reach prior agreement and withdraw the dispute from the Expert. At the time
the Expert renders its decision, it shall provide a written statement of
findings and conclusions regarding the Working Capital Adjustment Statement
and any disputed amounts set forth therein and shall issue a statement (the "
_Final Statement_ ") reflecting such decisions.

(iii) The decision of the Expert in respect of a Dispute Notice shall be final
and binding on the Parties in respect of the matters covered by such Dispute
Notice. In connection with a dispute, the fees and expenses of the Expert
shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. The fees and disbursements of
Sellers independent advisors incurred in connection with the Final Statement
shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and disbursements of Buyers
independent advisors incurred in connection with the Final Statement shall be
borne by Buyer.

 

(c) _Payments_.

(i) If the Closing Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.5_) is less than the Estimated Net
Working Capital, Seller shall pay such difference to Buyer. If the Closing
Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to the procedures set
forth in this _Section 2.5_) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, Buyer
shall pay such difference to Seller.

 

(ii) A Party owing any amount to the other Party in accordance with _Section
2.5(c)(i)_ shall pay such amount, not later than 10 days after the date on
which the Closing Net Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 2.5_) is finally determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.5_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts specified by such other Party,
together with interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ on such date calculated from, but not including,
the Closing Date until, and including, the date paid.

(d) _Straddle Tax Period_. The Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount of any ad valorem, personal property and similar Taxes for a Straddle
Tax Period that are allocated to Seller pursuant to _Section 5.9(a)_. Any
payment or reimbursement required after the Closing to give effect to this
_Section 2.5(d)_ shall be made promptly by the relevant Party.

 



19 2.6 _Actions_. All actions that will be taken and all documents that will be
executed and delivered by the Parties on the Closing Date will be deemed to
have been taken and executed simultaneously, and no action will be deemed
taken nor any document executed and delivered until all such actions have been
taken, and all such documents have been executed and delivered.

2.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
purchase and sale of the Equity Interests pursuant to this Agreement will be
treated as a purchase and sale of the Assets for federal income tax purposes
(and for purposes of any applicable state taxes that follow the federal income
tax treatment). Seller and Buyer have agreed in writing to the allocation of
the total consideration hereunder for the Assets among the Assets as described
in _Schedule 2.7_. Buyer and Seller shall each file or cause to be filed IRS
Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement) for its taxable year that includes
the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the allocation set forth on
_Schedule 2.7_. In the event that any adjustment is required to be made to the
asset allocation set forth on _Schedule 2.7_ as a result of any adjustment to
the consideration paid hereunder (and for this purpose, any payments from one
Party to the other under this Agreement after the Closing Date shall be
treated as an adjustment to the consideration paid hereunder), the Parties
agree to consult in good faith on such adjustment and how such adjustment
should be reflected in the allocation hereunder. Seller and Buyer further
agree not to take any Tax position inconsistent with any such allocation
in connection with (a) any examination of their respective Tax Returns or any
refund claims; or (b) any litigation, investigations or other proceedings
involving any of their respective Tax Returns, except as required following a
final determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent
jurisdiction or upon the consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably
conditioned or delayed).

(g) To the Knowledge of Seller, there has been no exposure of any Person

operated and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and (iii)

its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 

4.2 _Authority_. Buyer has all requisite limited partnership power and
authority to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents and to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents have been duly and validly
authorized by all required limited partnership action on the part of Buyer,
and no other proceedings on the part of Buyer, including all required limited
partnership approvals of Buyer, are necessary to authorize the Transaction
Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. This Agreement has

 



32  been, and the other Transaction Documents will be, duly and validly executed
and delivered by Buyer, and, assuming the Transaction Documents have been duly
authorized, executed, and delivered by Seller, the Transaction Documents
shall constitute valid and binding agreements of Buyer, enforceable against
Buyer in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar Laws
now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors rights
generally and, as to enforceability, general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law), and considerations of
public policy, including the effect of statutory and other Laws regarding
fraudulent conveyances and preferential transfers.

4.3  _No Conflicts_. Neither the execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents by Buyer nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents by Buyer do or will: (a) violate any provision of
the limited partnership agreement or any other constituent document of Buyer;
(b) other than under any Antitrust Law, require the consent, waiver,
authorization, filing with, notification to or approval or any other action of
any Governmental Authority; (c) other than any consent required under the
Buyers credit agreement, result in a material violation or breach of or
termination of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) a
material default under (or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, acceleration, or any obligation to repay), any of the terms,
conditions, or provisions of any indenture, mortgage, note, bond, encumbrance,
license, contract, lease, franchise, permit, agreement, or other instrument
or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its
properties or assets may be bound, or give rise to any Lien; or (d) violate
any Law applicable to Buyer or by which any of its properties or assets may be
bound. 

4.4 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending or, to

Buyer.

4.5 _Brokerage Agreements_. Buyer has not entered (directly or indirectly)
into any agreement with any Person for the payment of any commission,
brokerage or "finders fee" in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for which Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates would be

account for investment and not with a view towards the resale, transfer, or
distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing the
Equity Interests, in violation of the Securities Act, other applicable federal
or state securities laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Buyer acknowledges that the Equity Interests have not
been registered under the Securities Act or other applicable federal or state
securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, by
reason of the contemplated sale of the Equity Interests in a transaction

33  otherwise disposing of the Equity Interests, or any interest therein, in
such manner as to violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act

regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

4.7 _Availability of Funds_. At the Closing, Buyer shall have funds sufficient
to fund the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and satisfy all other costs and expenses arising in connection therewith for
which Buyer is responsible.

4.8 _Independent Investigation; Representations_. Buyer has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the assets and liabilities
of the Rangeland Entities and prospects of the COLT Business, which
investigation, review and analysis was done by Buyer and the Buyer
Representatives. Buyer acknowledges that it and the Buyer Representatives have
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises
and records of the COLT Business for such purpose. In entering into this
Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the
aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual
representations or opinions of Seller or the Seller Representatives (except
the specific representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement and any representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in any other Transaction Documents). Buyer hereby acknowledges and
agrees that other than the representations and warranties made in _Article
III_ of this Agreement, none of Seller or any of the Seller Representatives
makes or has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, at
law or in equity, with respect to the COLT Business, or the assets or
liabilities of the Rangeland Entities, including as to (i) the operation of
the COLT Business after the Closing, or (ii) the probable success or
profitability of the COLT Business after the Closing.

4.9 _Disclaimer_. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV OF THIS
AGREEMENT, BUYER IS NOT MAKING ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. NOTHING IN THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL BE
CONSTRUED OR INTERPRETED TO RESTRICT, LIMIT, DIMINISH OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY

filings necessary, proper or advisable under any Antitrust Law and all
other applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions

Governmental Authorities and consents of parties to contracts with the
Rangeland Entities, as applicable, as are required for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will defend against any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,

and non-assignable without the consent of the other party or parties thereto,
unless such consent shall have been given. In no event shall "good faith" or

any filing or submission that is necessary or advisable under any Antitrust
Law. Such notification and report form and all such supplemental information
filed or submitted by such Party (or such Affiliate) will be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the relevant Antitrust Law. Each Party
will use good faith to resolve such objections, if any, as the Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the

with any such inquiry or request and to defend against any action of any
Governmental Authority or other Person that attempts to enjoin the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party will, and will cause

whether disputed or not (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), arising out of
or in connection with or attributable to the transactions effected pursuant to
this Agreement. The Party required by Law to file all necessary Tax Returns
relating to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such Tax Returns, and
Buyer and Seller shall each, and shall each cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate to minimize the incurrence of any such Transfer Taxes, and with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes due, in the timely preparation and filing
of, and join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns.

earlier of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the date this Agreement is terminated

of (i) the commencement of any suit, action, claim, arbitration
or investigation against Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates (including the
Rangeland Entities) relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the COLT
Business or any of the Rangeland Entities, or (ii) any representation and
warranty given by Seller in this Agreement were becoming materially
inaccurate, in each case of which Seller has Knowledge, _provided_ that the
delivery of any such notice, or Buyer otherwise becoming aware of such a
matter, shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to Buyer
hereunder.

5.6 _Construction and Other Payments_. Except in respect of any amounts that
are reflected in Net Working Capital, Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer on

Dakota PSC in respect of the matter described in  _Schedule 1.1(d)_.

 



38 5.7 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall procure that
all intercompany arrangements between, on the one hand, a Rangeland Entity
and, on the other hand, Seller or any of its Affiliates or other Related
Persons, are terminated with no further liability to any Rangeland Entity.

 

5.8 _Access; Confidentiality._

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing or the
prior termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Buyer and its
counsel, accountants, financial advisors, potential financial sources,
employees, agents and other authorized representatives (the " _Buyer
Representatives_ ") shall be given reasonable access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the facilities, properties,
personnel, books and records (including Tax records) of Seller (with respect
to the Rangeland Entities or the COLT Business) and the Rangeland Entities for
the purpose of conducting an investigation of the COLT Business, the
Rangeland Entities and their financial condition, operations and status, and
the Assets; _provided, however_ , that (i) Buyer and the Buyer Representatives
will not request information, or otherwise contact, any officer, director or
employee of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates without arranging such
contact with Seller and (ii) such investigation shall be conducted in a manner
that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the
Rangeland Entities. Buyer will not request information from, or otherwise
contact, any vendor, supplier or customer of or to the Rangeland Entities or
the COLT Business without the prior written consent of Seller. Seller will,
and will cause the Rangeland Entities to, cause their respective counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, employees, agents and other authorized
representatives (the " _Seller Representatives_ ") to be available to Buyer
and the Buyer Representatives at all reasonable times, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, for such purposes. Seller shall have
the right to have a Seller Representative present at all times during any such
inspections, interviews and examinations. Any environmental
property assessment conducted by Buyer shall be limited to Phase I only.
Buyer shall not be entitled to conduct additional Phase II environmental
property assessments without Sellers prior written consent, which may be
withheld in Sellers sole discretion. Any sampling, boring, drilling or other
invasive investigation activities shall be considered "Phase II" activities.

(b) (i) From the date of this Agreement until Closing and, if applicable, for
12 months after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Buyer Representatives to, hold in confidence all information provided to
Buyer or the Buyer Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ on terms
and subject to conditions equivalent to those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (ii) for 12 months after Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, not make disclosure to third parties of any
Confidential Information (as defined below), except with the prior consent of
Buyer or as required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8(b)(ii)_ shall not (x) apply
to any Person who executes the Non-Compete Agreement attached as _Exhibit C_
to this Agreement; or (y) restrict Seller, the Seller Representatives
or Sellers Affiliates from using any Confidential Information in connection
with the development, organization, financing, engineering, construction or
commercial operation of any business or facility that is not a Competitive
Activity as 

 



39  defined in the Non-Compete Agreement, including disclosures to third parties
as necessary for the foregoing (provided that the foregoing shall not permit
the disclosure by Seller, the Seller Representatives or Sellers Affiliates
of the Material Contracts to third parties to the extent the Material
Contracts constitute Confidential Information); or (z) restrict Seller, the
Seller Representatives or Sellers Affiliates from using generalized
knowledge, skills, and experience after the Closing Date. " _Confidential
Information_ " means any Material Contracts, any confidential financial
information of the Rangeland Entities that applies solely to the COLT
Business or any of the Assets and any other information of the Rangeland
Entities that has historically been treated as confidential by the Rangeland
Entities that applies solely to the COLT Business or any of the Assets.
However, Confidential Information does not include, and there will be no
obligation hereunder with respect to, information that: (i) is generally
available to the public on the Closing Date or (ii) becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure not otherwise
permissible under this Agreement or any other agreement or law regarding the
use or disclosure of confidential information; or (iii) is necessary to
disclose to a third party in order to resolve or potentially resolve a
dispute with Buyer.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 5.8(a)_, Buyer shall have no right of access
to, and Seller shall have no obligation to provide to Buyer, information
relating to (i) bids received from others in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or similar transactions) and information
and analyses (including financial analyses) relating to such bids, (ii) any
information, the disclosure of which would jeopardize any privilege available
to Seller, any of the Rangeland Entities or any Affiliate of Seller relating
to such information or would cause Seller, any of the Rangeland Entities or
any Affiliate of Seller to breach a confidentiality obligation or (iii) any
information the disclosure of which would comprise a violation of Law. To the
extent reasonably practicable, Seller and Buyer shall use good faith to make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restriction of the preceding sentence applies.

 

(d) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties and their respective
representatives, and save them harmless, effective as and from the date
hereof, from and against any Damages that they or any of them may suffer or
incur, or that may be made or brought against any of them, as a result of, in
respect of, or arising out of or in connection with any site visits or
inspections by Buyer or its Affiliates of the assets or properties of any
Seller Indemnified Party. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _SECTION 5.8_
SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON
FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF THE FRAUD OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF
ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.

 



40 5.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Allocation of Taxes._ Ad valorem, personal property and similar Taxes
that are not based on income, wages or receipts that are imposed with respect
to the Assets or the Rangeland Entities for a Straddle Tax Period shall be
prorated and allocated between Buyer and Seller based on the number of days in
such Straddle Tax Period on or before and after the Closing Date. Sellers
share of such Taxes shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the
Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Tax Period on or before the Closing Date, and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Tax
Period. Buyers share of such Taxes shall be equal to the total amount of such
Taxes for the Straddle Tax Period less the amount of such Taxes for the
Straddle Tax Period allocated to Seller as computed in the previous sentence.
All other Taxes (other than Taxes described in the preceding provisions of
this _Section 5.9(a)_) imposed with respect to the Assets or the Rangeland
Entities for a Straddle Period shall be prorated and allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business
on the Closing Date.

(b) _Tax Treatment of Purchase of Equity Interests_. Buyer and Seller agree to
treat the purchase of the Equity Interests pursuant to this Agreement for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and state and local tax purposes that follow the
federal income tax treatment) as the purchase by Buyer of all the Assets.
Buyer and Seller agree to report and file (and cause their Affiliates to
report and file) their U.S. federal income Tax Returns (and state and local
Tax Returns where applicable) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with such treatment, except as otherwise required following a final
determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of competent
jurisdiction or upon consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably
conditioned or delayed). Buyer and Seller further agree not to take (and to
cause their respective Affiliates not to take) any position, whether in any
Tax Return, audit, examination, claim, adjustment, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income tax (and state and local tax
purposes where applicable), which is inconsistent with such intended
treatment. Seller shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and pay,
all federal income taxes, state income taxes and other similar taxes
(including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred by or imposed on
Seller or the Rangeland Entities with respect to the income earned by the
Rangeland Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and gain to Seller from the
transactions described in this Agreement.

5.10 _Seller Marks_. Except to the extent set forth in this _Section 5.10_,
Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or any other right
whatsoever to use the words "Rangeland", "Rangeland Terminals", or "Rangeland
Pipeline" or any trademarks or logos containing or comprising the foregoing,
or any trademark or logo confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof, or
any trademark or logo used in connection therewith (collectively, the "
_Seller Marks_ "). From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall (a)
cause the Rangeland Entities to cease using the Seller Marks in any manner,
directly or indirectly, except for such limited uses as cannot be promptly
terminated ( _e.g._ , signage and other matters addressed in _Section
5.10(b)_), and to cease such limited usage of the Seller Marks as promptly as
reasonably possible after the Closing and in any event within 90 days
following the Closing Date, and (b) (i) remove, strike

 



41  over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from all signs at the field
offices owned, possessed or used by the Rangeland Entities and (ii) replace
all of the Rangeland Entities emergency signage (including emergency contact
telephone numbers) with Buyer signage, in each case within 30 days after the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this
_Section 5.10_ for the Environmental Permits or other permits to continue to
reflect the name of any of the Rangeland Entities (or use the Seller Marks) so
long as Buyer has since Closing taken (and continues to take) all commercially
reasonable actions necessary to comply with its obligations under _Section
5.12_ as promptly as reasonably practicable. During any period that Buyer is
using the Seller Marks as provided in this _Section 5.10_, Buyer shall use
good faith efforts to inform customers, suppliers and contractors that it is
not part of Seller or its Affiliates and is using the Seller Marks with
permission solely to facilitate the transition of the Business. The Parties
agree, because damages would be an inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to
enforce this _Section 5.10_ shall be entitled to seek specific performance
and injunctive relief as remedies for any breach thereof in addition to other
remedies available at law or in equity. This covenant shall survive
indefinitely without limitation as to time.

5.11 _Books and Records_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Books and Records
no later than 30 days after the Closing Date. From and after such delivery,
Buyer shall preserve and keep a copy of the Books and Records for a period of
at least seven years after the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide to Seller, at
no cost or expense to Seller, reasonable access (during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice) to the Books and Records as remain in
Buyers possession and reasonable access (during normal business hours and
upon reasonable prior notice) to the properties and employees of Buyer and
the Rangeland Entities in connection with matters relating to the business or
operations of the Rangeland Entities on or before the Closing Date and any
disputes relating to this Agreement.

 

5.12 _Notifications and Business Permits_. Buyer shall provide all notices and
otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to amend, transfer or reissue
the Business Permits listed on _Schedule 3.5(b)_ to no longer reflect the
name of any of the Rangeland Entities (or use the Seller Marks) as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Seller shall use good faith to cooperate with Buyer
to provide information reasonably necessary to so amend, transfer or reissue
such Business Permits.

5.13  _Employee and Benefit Plan Matters_.

(a) _Reserved_.

 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall terminate or transfer the
employment of all employees of the Rangeland Entities that are not Subject
Employees such that the only employees of the Rangeland Entities as of the
Closing shall be the Subject Employees. Seller shall be solely liable for any
severance or other obligations arising out of the actions described in this
_Section 5.13(b)_.

(c) Except as would result in a duplication of benefits, Buyer shall cause
its Employee Plans (and the Employee Plans of any Affiliate of Buyer) which
provide benefits to Subject Employees after Closing to provide the Subject
Employees with credit for service with Affiliates of Seller for purposes
of eligibility and vesting, and for

 



42  purposes of determining vacation and severance benefits. Buyer shall waive
(or cause to be waived) any pre-existing condition limitation and eligibility
waiting period under the Employee Plans provided to the Subject Employees
following Closing, and shall recognize (or cause to be reorganized) the dollar
amount of all expenses incurred by the Subject Employees and respective
spouses and dependents during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
for purposes of satisfying deductibles and co-payment thereunder for such
calendar year (but not out of pocket maximums) under the medical plans of
Buyer (or its Affiliates). Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that all Subject Employees are eligible for coverage under a medical
plan of Buyer (or its Affiliates) immediately upon the Closing.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary to terminate
or change the sponsoring employer of the Rangeland Benefit Plans such that the
Rangeland Entities are not a participating employer in any Rangeland Benefit
Plans from and after the Closing and that Buyer and the Rangeland Entities
shall have no liability (actual or potential) with respect to the Rangeland
Benefit Plans.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall be
solely responsible for all costs, expenses and liabilities relating to (i)
any current or former employees, consultants or independent contractors of
Seller and its Affiliates (including the Rangeland Entities) other than the
Subject Employees, (ii) any Subject Employees who are not employed by the
Rangeland Entities as of the Closing, or (iii) the Rangeland Benefit Plans
(including any Subject Employees participation therein). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (x) as soon as practicable but in no event
greater than 30 days following the Closing, Seller shall make a cash payment
to each Subject Employee equal to the value of such Subject Employees
vacation and paid time off that is accrued but unused as of the Closing
(less applicable tax withholding) and (y) from and after the Closing, Buyer,
the Rangeland Entities and their Affiliates shall have no obligation with
respect to vacation and paid time off that accrued with respect to Subject
Employees prior to the Closing.

(f) Nothing express or implied by this Agreement shall (i) confer upon any
Subject Employee or any other employee, consultant or independent contractor
(or any other current or former employee of Seller or any of its Affiliates,
including the Rangeland Entities), or representative thereof, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement or otherwise limit the right
of Buyer and its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Subject
Employee at any time, or (ii) be deemed to amend any Employee Plan of Seller,
Buyer or any of their Affiliates.

5.14 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. For a period of not less than
six years after the Closing Date, the Organizational Documents of the
Rangeland Entities shall continue to provide for at least the same
exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses to and holding harmless
of, all past and present employees, directors, officers, representatives,
agents, and managers of such entity for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Closing as are contained in such documents as of the date of
execution of this Agreement, and Buyer shall cause the Rangeland Entities to
honor all such provisions, including making any indemnification

 



43  payments and expense advancements thereunder; provided that such
indemnification payments shall constitute Damages to the extent the Buyer
Indemnified Parties would have an indemnity claim therefor under _Article
VII_. If any indemnifiable claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect
of such claim shall continue to the extent currently permitted under the
relevant entitys Organizational Documents until such claim is disposed of or
all orders in connection with such claim are fully satisfied.

5.15 _Release of Credit Agreement_. On or before Closing, Seller shall obtain
a full release effective as of the Closing Date releasing (i) all Liens
encumbering or affecting any of the Equity Interests or the Assets which are
created under or pursuant to or evidenced by the Credit Agreement and (ii)
each of the Rangeland Entities and Seller from all of their respective
obligations (including, without limitation, any and all guaranty obligations)
under or pursuant to the Credit Agreement and deliver evidence of such release
to Buyer.

5.16 _Entry into Capacity Contracts_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement:

(a) The Rangeland Entities will be entitled, prior to Closing, to enter into
(i) any Capacity Contract meeting or exceeding the Minimum Capacity Contract
Requirements; provided that prior to the execution of any such contract, Buyer
will be given the reasonable opportunity to review the proposed counterparty,
contract term and rate to be charged with respect to such contract (which
information shall be kept confidential by Buyer), and (ii) any Capacity
Contracts for Non-Compliant Capacity with the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that in connection with any such
consent, Buyer and Seller shall have agreed for purposes of _Section 2.3(a)_
the amount of Non-Compliant Capacity applicable to such Capacity Contract.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Rangeland Entities shall not enter into
Capacity Contracts pursuant to this _Section 5.16(a)_ in excess of 10 MBD in
the aggregate.

 

(b) Between the Closing and the earlier of the Capacity Contract Deadline and
the date on which none of the Capacity Contracts Escrow Amount remains on
deposit in the Escrow Account, Buyer will use its good faith, commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into, or cause the Rangeland Entities to enter
into, one or more Capacity Contracts for Post-Closing Committed Capacity for
any part of the 10 MBD rail capacity of the COLT Terminal that was not
committed as of the Closing. Upon execution, Buyer will provide prompt notice
to Seller of the counterparty, contract term and rate to be charged with
respect to any such Capacity Contract (which information shall be kept
confidential by Seller).

(c) If, despite, Buyers use of good faith, commercially reasonable efforts,
Buyer is unable to enter into Capacity Contracts for Post-Closing Committed
Capacity, it will be entitled to enter into one or more Capacity Contracts for
Non-Compliant Capacity; provided that until the earlier of the Capacity
Contract Deadline and the date on which none of the Capacity Contracts Escrow
Amount remains on deposit in the Escrow Account, prior to the execution of any
such Capacity Contract, (i) Seller will be given the 

 



44  reasonable opportunity to review the proposed counterparty, contract term
and rate to be charged with respect to such Capacity Contract (which
information shall be kept confidential by Seller) and (ii) Buyer and Seller
will act in good faith to agree on, for purposes of _Section 2.3(a)_, the
amount of Non-Compliant Capacity to be applicable to such Capacity Contract.

 

5.17 _Required Capital Projects_. Prior to Closing, Seller and the Rangeland
Entities will progress with all commercial diligence to Complete the Required
Capital Projects in accordance with the Required Capital Projects Plan, except
as may otherwise be agreed by Buyer. If at Closing the Required Capital
Projects are not Complete, Buyer shall Complete the Required Capital Projects
in accordance with the Required Capital Projects Plan and commensurate with
the standards generally adopted by the Seller before Closing, and shall grant
to Seller reasonable access to the Facilities to observe the Completion of
the Required Capital Projects by Buyer.

5.18 _Assistance with Buyer Financing and Inergy Securities Filings_. From and
after the date hereof and at any applicable time during the period ending
December 31, 2013 (provided that such obligations in respect of the Buyer
Financing shall only continue through the Closing Date), on Buyers reasonable
request (and at Buyers sole cost and expense):

(a) Seller shall use reasonable efforts and shall cause the
Rangeland Entities and their respective employees, agents and representatives
to use reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer all cooperation reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of any bridge or other
debt or equity financing entered into by Buyer in connection with the Closing
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Buyer Financing_
").

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable efforts to
furnish to Buyer such information in Sellers possession or control in
connection with the COLT Business as is reasonably necessary for the
preparation and filing of any filings the Buyer is required to make with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under applicable Law (the " _Required Buyer
Filings_ ") or in connection with the Buyer Financing.

(c) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining the
consents of Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P., the independent public accountants of
the Rangeland Entities, to include the reports of Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P.
with respect to any financial statements relating to the Rangeland Entities in
the Required Buyer Filings or in any offering documents used in connection
with any Buyer Financing, and to cause to be delivered to Buyer, at Buyers
expense, customary "comfort" letters of Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P. with regard
to the financial information of the Rangeland Entities included or referred
to in such Required Buyer Filing or in any such offering document.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that obtaining any Buyer Financing is not a condition
to Buyer complying with its obligations under this Agreement, including
closing the transactions contemplated herein following satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions in  _Section 6.1_.

 



45 5.19 _Retention of Environmental Insurance_. For a period of one (1) year from
and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not cancel, request a refund of
premiums paid or otherwise terminate any pollution liability insurance policy
included in the Assets purchased by Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein; provided, however, that Buyer shall not be obligated to
renew any such policies that expire during such period.

Agreement and the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Parties shall
survive until 12 months following the Closing Date, at which time such
representations, warranties or covenants will terminate and no indemnification

7.4 _Procedures_.

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party that is entitled
to seek indemnification under _Section 7.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") has
a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , other than a claim for
indemnification that involves a Third Party Claim, it shall give written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller or Buyer, as applicable (in each case,
the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail to the extent then known the nature of such claim and the factual basis
and circumstances surrounding the same and set forth an estimate of the amount
of Damages attributable to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within
30 days after its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party in
writing as to whether the Indemnifying Party admits or disputes the claim
described in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party gives written notice
that it admits the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice, then
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article VII_ , and subject to the limitations hereof,
with respect to the estimated amount of Damages stated in the Claim Notice. If
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing that it
disputes the claim for indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of
the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with respect
thereto but disputes the

 



49  amount of the Damages in connection therewith, then in either of such cases
the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be a disputed
indemnification claim that must be resolved by settlement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or by proceedings commenced in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party or by any other mutually agreeable method. 

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding made or brought by any
Person who or which is not a Party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_
") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Person against
whom or which such indemnification is being sought is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 10 Business Days after receipt of such written notice of such Third
Party Claim (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "). Such notice by the
Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all available material documentation, and will
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that
have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Within 15 days after
receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party either (i)
disputes the right of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this
_Article VII_ with respect to the Third Party Claim or (ii) admits the right
of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with
respect to Damages arising in connection with the Third Party Claim. The
failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond to the Indemnified Party within
such 15-day period after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice shall be
deemed to constitute a response by the Indemnifying Party that it disputes the
right of such Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_
with respect to that Third Party Claim.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party admits in writing that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this  _Article VII_ with respect to a Third
Party Claim, then in such event (i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently
defend the Third Party Claim with counsel approved by the Indemnified Party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of the
Third Party Claim unless such settlement is approved in writing by the
Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_ , that with respect to any claim
related to Taxes, such claim shall be defended by the applicable taxpayer
subject to the control of the Indemnifying Party and the approval rights of
the foregoing clause (ii). The costs and expenses of such defense shall be
payable by the Indemnifying Party. If, however, (i) the Indemnifying Party at
any time fails to so conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) the
Indemnified Party (A) determines in good faith that there is a reasonable
probability that a proceeding may adversely affect it other than as a result
of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to full indemnification
under this Agreement or (B) upon consultation with counsel has reasonably
determined in its good faith judgment that joint representation by counsel for
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party violates or could violate
applicable ethical and professional rules, then the Indemnified

 



50  Party (upon notice to the Indemnifying Party) may participate, together with
counsel for the Indemnifying Party, in the defense, compromise or settlement
of such Third Party Claims, and the reasonable costs and expenses of such
participation shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party disputes the right of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification under this _Article VII_ with respect to the Third Party Claim
described in a Third Party Claim Notice, then in such event (i) the
Indemnified Party may defend the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party (x) shall diligently
defend such Third Party Claim and (y) may not enter into a settlement thereof
without obtaining approval of the Indemnifying Party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the Indemnified
Party will not be seeking indemnification for any amounts paid pursuant to
such settlement thereof or for any other consequences, or such settlement
would not prejudice the rights of the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) the amount
of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third
Party Claim shall be a disputed indemnification claim to be resolved by
settlement between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or by
proceedings commenced in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by
either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party or by any other
mutually agreeable method.

(e) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in
any notice as provided in _Section 7.4(a)_ or _7.4(b)_ will not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party hereunder, except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such
notice or information was deprived of its right to recover any payment under
its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

7.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.9_,
_Section 5.13_ and _Section 8.17_ and except in the case of Fraud or willful
misconduct, the indemnification and remedies set forth in this _Article VII_
shall, from and after the Closing, constitute the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Parties with respect to any breach of representation or warranty or
non-performance, partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.5_
shall prevent either Party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in
pursuit of its indemnification claims under this _Article VII_. EXCEPT WITH
RESPECT TO CLAIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, EACH OF BUYER AND
SELLER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER DISCHARGES THE OTHER PARTY
AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, OR ANY OTHER
PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF SUCH RELEASED PARTY, OF AND FROM ANY AND ALL
CLAIMS, ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, DEMANDS, RIGHTS, DAMAGES, COSTS,
EXPENSES, LOSSES OR COMPENSATION WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, WHICH THE RELEASING PARTY NOW HAS OR
MAY HAVE OR WHICH MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING
ANY OF THE FOREGOING THAT IS FROM OR

 



51  RELATING TO THE POSSESSION, USE, HANDLING, MANAGEMENT, DISPOSAL,
INVESTIGATION, REMEDIATION, CLEANUP OR RELEASE OF ANY WASTES OR OTHER
SUBSTANCES GOVERNED BY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW APPLICABLE
THERETO.

7.6 _Determination of Amount of Losses_. The Damages giving rise to any 
_Section 7.3_ indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to the
actual Damage incurred by the Indemnified Party that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment actually
received by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events giving rise to
the claim for indemnification, including any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually received by the Indemnified Party (less the amount of
any deductible paid or reasonable costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection therewith). Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with information
sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the
indemnity payment in accordance with this _Section 7.6_. An Indemnified Party
shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate damages in respect
of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreements for any Damages. If an Indemnified
Party receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any
other Persons alleged to be responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and reimburse the
Indemnifying Party, as directed by the Indemnifying Party, for any payment
made or expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with
providing such indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by
the Indemnified Party (less the amount of any deductible paid or reasonable
costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection therewith).

ARTICLE VIII 

MISCELLANEOUS

notwithstanding, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Seller as evidenced in writing signed
by each of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would give rise to the failure of a condition to the obligations of Buyer
at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of
being cured, such breach has not been cured by Seller within 30 days after
written notice thereof from Buyer, provided that Buyer is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement at such time;

 



52 (c) by Seller, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition to the
obligations of Seller at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character
that it is capable of being cured, such breach has not been cured by Buyer
within 30 days after written notice thereof from Seller, provided that Seller
is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement at such time; and

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated by the date that is 3 months following the date of this
Agreement unless the FTC or the DOJ issues a Second Request, in which case
Buyer or Seller may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)_ if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated by
the date that is 6 months following the date of this Agreement; _provided,
however_ , that neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(d)_ if such Persons breach of this
Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

8.2 _Effect of Termination and Actions for Monetary Damages_. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided in _Section 8.1_, there shall be no
Liability on the part of any Party hereto with respect hereto; _provided,
however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for any
material breach hereof by such Party if this Agreement is terminated by the
non-breaching Party under _Section 8.1(b)_,  _Section 8.1(c)_ or _Section
8.1(d)_, as applicable.

8.3 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall provide
any benefit to any Third Party or entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause
of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties
that this Agreement shall not be construed as a Third Party beneficiary
contract; _provided, however_ , that the indemnification provisions in
_Article VII_ shall inure to the benefit of Buyer Indemnified Parties and
Seller Indemnified Parties as provided therein ( _provided, however_ , that
any claim for indemnity hereunder on behalf of an Indemnified Party must be
made and administered by Seller or Buyer, as applicable).

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party
shall bear all of its legal, accounting and other costs and expenses incident
to the negotiation of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

8.6 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the several Articles and Sections
of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a
part of the Agreement.

 



54 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents, the documents to be
executed thereunder and the Exhibits and Schedules constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

8.8 _Waiver_. Any Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of any other Party or (b) waive compliance with
any of the agreements of any other Party or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such Party. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement at a
particular time shall be deemed to be a waiver of that breach at any other
time, or of any other breach of this Agreement at any time.

8.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by Buyer and Seller. No supplement, alteration or modification
of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by Buyer and
Seller.

8.10 _Public Statements_. Prior to the Closing Date, no Party (or Affiliate
thereof) shall issue a press release or other public announcement concerning
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, except as required by applicable
Law or the applicable rules or regulations of any securities exchange or
Governmental Authority and after providing the other Party the opportunity to
review (and propose amendments to) such press release or public announcement.

8.11 _Assignment_. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns, but no Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party to this Agreement.

8.12 _Independent Covenants_. The covenants contained herein are independent
and separate, and in the event that any provision contained herein is declared
invalid or illegal, the other provisions hereof shall not be affected or
impaired thereby and shall remain valid and enforceable. 

8.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas, without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

8.14 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the courts of the
State of Texas located in Houston, Harris County, Texas or any federal court
of competent jurisdiction in the State of Texas and each of the Parties
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such

 



55  suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action
or proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT. Process in any suit,
action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether
within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided
in _Section 8.5_ will be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

 

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which together shall constitute one agreement binding on
the Parties. A facsimile or email transmission of a scanned, executed
counterpart of this Agreement shall be sufficient to bind a Party to the same
extent as an original.

 

8.16 _Limitation of Liability_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE
LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (OTHER THAN ANY SUCH DAMAGES ASSERTED BY A THIRD PARTY
AGAINST THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY, COVENANT OR AGREEMENT IN THIS AGREEMENT), WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE
BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY OF
LIABILITY, INCLUDING DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR DAMAGES DETERMINED AS A MULTIPLE
OF INCOME.

8.17  _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the COLT Business and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer and Seller will not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages and
will be irreparably damaged in the event that Closing fails to occur, or is
rendered incapable of occurring, as a result Sellers or Buyers, as the case
may be, breach of any term of this Agreement, and, therefore, the Parties
agree that Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to request
or pursue specific enforcement of the terms hereof to compel Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8.18 _Further Assurances_. The Parties shall deliver any and all other
instruments or documents and take such other and further action as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.
