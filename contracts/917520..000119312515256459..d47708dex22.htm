behalf of itself or the TEI Med Securityholders with respect thereto after the
Effective Time;

 



17 (vi) engage, employ or appoint any agents or representatives (including

the SH Rep on all matters relating to this Agreement (including _ARTICLE 11_ )
and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any
kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on
behalf of any TEI Med Securityholder by the SH Rep, and on any other action
taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any TEI Med Securityholder by the
SH Rep, as being fully binding upon such Person. Notices or communications to
or from the SH Rep shall constitute notice to or from each of the TEI Med
Securityholders. Any decision or action by the SH Rep hereunder, including any
agreement between the SH Rep and any Parent-Side Indemnified Person relating
to the defense, payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification
hereunder, shall constitute a decision or action of all TEI Med
Securityholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Person. No TEI Med Securityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent
from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The provisions of this _Section
2.8(b)_, including the power of attorney granted hereby, are independent and

operation of Law, whether by death or other event.

 

(c) _Resignation, etc_. The SH Rep may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of a majority in
interest of the TEI Med Securityholders calculated based on each TEI Med

_however_ , that in no event shall the SH Rep resign or be removed without
the Majority Holders having first appointed a new SH Rep who shall assume such
duties immediately upon the resignation or removal of the SH Rep. In the event
of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the SH Rep, a new SH Rep
shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of the Majority Holders.
Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such new SH
Rep shall be sent to Parent, such appointment to be effective upon the later
of the date indicated in such consent or the date such notice is received by
Parent; _provided_ , that until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub
Med and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the decisions
and actions of the prior SH Rep as described in _Section 2.8(a)_ above.

(d) _Limits on Liability; Indemnification_. The SH Rep shall not be liable
to the TEI Med Securityholders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or to have involved fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith (it
being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel, accountants or other professionals and experts retained by the SH Rep
shall be conclusive 

 



18  evidence of good faith). The TEI Med Securityholders shall severally and not
jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares), indemnify and hold
harmless the SH Rep from and against, compensate it for, reimburse it for and
pay any and all losses, liabilities, claims, actions, damages and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, arising out of and in
connection with its activities as the SH Rep under this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement (the " _SH Rep Losses_ "), in each case as such SH Rep Loss
is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that if it is finally adjudicated that
an SH Rep Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross
negligence, fraud, intentional misconduct or bad faith of the SH Rep, the SH
Rep shall reimburse the TEI Med Securityholder for the amount of such
indemnified SH Rep Loss attributable to such gross negligence, fraud,
intentional misconduct or bad faith. The SH Rep Losses shall be satisfied: (
_i_ ) from the SH Rep Expense Amount; and ( _ii_ ) to the extent the amount of
the SH Rep Losses exceeds amounts available to the SH Rep under (i), from (
_a_ ) the TEI Med Securityholders, severally and not jointly (in accordance
with their Pro Rata Shares) or ( _b_ ) the Escrow Fund, to the extent such
funds have been made available for distribution to the TEI Med
Securityholders. As soon as practicable after the date on which the final
obligations of the SH Rep under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement have
been discharged or such other date as the SH Rep deems appropriate, the Escrow
Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the SH Rep Expense Amount to the TEI
Med Securityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, as set forth in
the Escrow Agreement.

19 TEI Med shall deliver to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing a revised _Schedule 3.1(a)_ , updating any estimates included in
_Schedule 3.1(a)_ attached hereto, which revised _Schedule 3.1(a)_ shall be
deemed thereafter to be the final Consideration Spreadsheet for all purposes
under this Agreement; _provided_  that in no event will any such changes
increase the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration (except to the extent
resulting from an increase in Estimated Closing Cash).

 

(b) _Reliance_. Parent and Merger Sub Med shall be entitled to rely on the
Consideration Spreadsheet in making and causing the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent to make payments hereunder and Parent and Merger Sub Med
shall not be responsible for the calculations or the determinations regarding
such calculations in the Consideration Spreadsheet.

 



     | 3.2 | _Paying Agent_ 
---|---|--- 

Parent hereby appoints the Paying Agent to act as the paying agent for
the payments to be paid by the Paying Agent provided in _Section 3.3_.

---|---|--- 

(a) _Closing Merger Consideration_. ( _i_ ) TEI Med shall wire to the Paying
Agent, in immediately available funds, at or prior to the Effective Time, an
amount equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, ( _ii_ ) Parent shall wire to the
Paying Agent, in immediately available funds, at or prior to the Effective

_B_ ) the sum of ( _1_ ) an amount equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, ( _2_
) the Option Closing Merger Consideration and (3) the aggregate exercise
prices of all In-Money Options.

(b) _Certain Closing Payments (other than to the Paying Agent)_. At Closing,
Parent shall (out of the Purchase Price):

(i) pay the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Escrow Agent;

(ii) pay the applicable Transaction Expenses described under subclause (a) of

accounts designated in its Pay-Off Letter; and 

(iii) pay the SH Rep Expense Amount to the account designated by the SH Rep

_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and ( _ii_ ) instructions for use in effecting the

Person other than the Person in whose name the Common Certificate, if
applicable, so surrendered is registered, if such Common Certificate is
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall ( _A_ ) pay any stock transfer Tax required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Common Certificate or ( _B_ ) establish to the satisfaction of Parent that any
such Tax has been paid or is otherwise not applicable.

Option Surrender Agreement, the applicable portion of the Closing Merger

Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Common
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the date that is two (2) years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
Merger Consideration in respect of such Common Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any Merger
Consideration in respect of such Common Certificate shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto and the Paying Agent shall release such Merger Consideration to the
Surviving Corporation promptly thereafter.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. TEI Med, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
Merger Sub Med shall be entitled to (and to cause the Paying Agent or Escrow
Agent to) deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and

any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of
which TEI Med, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or Merger Sub Med (or the
Paying Agent or Escrow Agent) made such deduction and withholding.

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Common
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Common Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall issue or cause to
be issued to such Person the consideration deliverable in respect of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Common Certificate, determined and effected in
accordance with _Section 2.6_, _provided_ that the Person to whom the Merger
Consideration is paid 

 



21  shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, indemnify the
Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to it against any
claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Common Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(a) _Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Amount shall be delivered by Parent to the
Escrow Agent in accordance with _Section 3.3(b)_ to be held and administered
in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

after the Closing Date, Parent and the SH Rep shall deliver joint written
instructions (the " _Joint Written Instructions_ ") to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to the TEI Med Securityholders
entitled to receive Closing Merger Consideration an amount equal to the
amount remaining in the Escrow Fund _minus_ the amount of any unresolved
Indemnity Claims, except as provided in the Support Agreement with respect to
Joint Securityholders. Thereafter, after resolution of all unresolved
Indemnity Claims, Parent and the SH Rep shall deliver Joint Written
Instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to
the TEI Med Securityholders entitled to receive Closing Merger Consideration
any remaining amount in the Escrow Fund, except as provided in the Support
Agreement with respect to Joint Securityholders.

(c) _Instructions for Release_. Any Joint Written Instructions for release of
amounts in the Escrow Fund to the TEI Med Securityholders shall direct the

subject to _Section 3.6_ and the terms of the Escrow Agreement.



     | 3.5 | _Merger Consideration Adjustment_ 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Estimated Net Working Capital_. No later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, TEI Med shall deliver to Parent a calculation of
Estimated Closing Working Capital. The amount, if any, by which Target Closing
Working Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital shall be referred
to herein as the " _Estimated Working Capital Deficit_ ". The amount, if any,
by which Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds Target Closing Working
Capital shall be referred to herein as the " _Estimated Working Capital
Excess_."

(b) _Review and Cooperation_. No later than one hundred twenty (120) days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the SH Rep a calculation of
Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash (the " _Calculations_ "). The SH Rep
shall have the right to review the Calculations and Parent shall and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to give the SH Rep reasonable access to
documentation and financial information used in the preparation of the
Calculations. If the SH Rep does not agree with the Calculations, no later
than sixty (60) days after receipt of the Calculations, the SH Rep shall
deliver to the Parent a notice (the " _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ")
describing any item or amount in any of the Calculations that is so disputed.
If the SH Rep does not deliver an Adjustment Dispute Notice within such sixty
(60)-day period, the SH Rep shall be deemed to agree with the Calculations and
_Section 3.5(d)_ shall apply.

 



22 (c) _Dispute Resolution_. If the SH Rep delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice
within such sixty (60)-day period, Parent and the SH Rep shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such dispute, but if such dispute is not resolved
within ten (10) Business Days after the date that Parent receives the
Adjustment Dispute Notice, then the SH Representative and Parent shall refer
such dispute to the Independent Accountants for resolution. In no event shall
the Independent Accountants determination be in an amount that is outside the
range of the disagreement between Parent and the SH Rep. Parent and the SH
Rep shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountants to make such determination within thirty (30) days of such dispute
being referred to the Independent Accountants. The determination made by the
Independent Accountants shall be final and binding on the parties, absent
manifest error, and the cost of retaining the Independent Accountants for this
purpose shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and borne by the TEI
Med Securityholders (payable out of the Escrow Amount), on the other hand, in
the proportion that Parents position, on the one hand, and SH Reps position,
on the other hand (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a
whole), bear to the final resolution as determined by the Independent
Accountants.

(i) If it is determined pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ that ( _A_ ) Estimated
Closing Working Capital, _plus_  Estimated Closing Cash, exceeds ( _B_ )
Closing Working Capital, _plus_ Closing Cash, then such excess shall be
referred to herein as the " _Working Capital Deficit_ ". If it is determined
pursuant to this  _Section 3.5_ that ( _A_ ) Closing Working Capital, _plus_
Closing Cash, exceeds ( _B_ ) Estimated Closing Working Capital, _plus_
Estimated Closing Cash, then such excess shall be referred to herein as the "
_Working Capital Excess_ ".

(ii) If it is determined pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ that there is a
Working Capital Deficit, then not later than five (5) Business Days after
such determination Parent and the SH Rep shall instruct the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Parent from the Escrow Amount an amount equal to the Working
Capital Deficit.

 

(iii) If it is determined pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ that there is a
Working Capital Excess, then not later than five (5) Business Days after such
determination Parent shall deposit an amount equal to the Working Capital
Excess with the Paying Agent and cause the Paying Agent to disburse such
Working Capital Excess amount to the TEI Med Securityholders entitled to
receive Closing Merger Consideration based on their Pro Rata Shares, subject
to _Section 3.6_.

(iv) If it is determined pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ that neither clause
( _ii_ ) nor ( _iii_ ) of this _Section 3.5_ applies, then no Merger
Consideration adjustment payment shall be made.

 

(e) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Any payments pursuant to this _Section
3.5_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to Merger
Consideration unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(f) _Indemnification Not Affected_. Parents and the other Parent-Side
Indemnified Person rights to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall
not be deemed to limit, supersede or otherwise affect, or be limited,
superseded or otherwise affected by, Parents rights under this  _Section
3.5_, except to the extent set forth in _Section 11.2(e)(v)_.

 



23 ---|---|--- 

Parent shall wire the amount of the Closing Merger Consideration payable to
the Optionholders to TEI Med at Closing (the " _Option Closing Merger
Consideration_ "). Parent shall cause TEI Med, or its payroll agent, as
applicable, to pay the applicable portion of such Option Closing
Merger Consideration to each Optionholder that has delivered an Option
Surrender Agreement to Parent (or the Paying Agent), subject to _Section
3.3(f)_. Such payments will be made within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing Date for all Optionholders who have delivered an Option Surrender
Agreement to Parent (or the Paying Agent) at or prior to the Closing Date and,
for each other Optionholder, within fifteen (15) days after such Optionholder
shall have delivered an Option Surrender Agreement to Parent (or the Paying
Agent).



     | 3.7 | _Transfer Taxes_ 
---|---|--- 

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and
other similar Taxes incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne
and paid 50% by the TEI Med Securityholders and 50% by Parent when due. The SH

of any Person (other than TEI Med) (i) under Treasury Regulations Section

indemnification becomes aware of any fact that may give rise to Losses for

Claim made therein, the indemnity obligation set forth therein shall be

claimed in an Indemnity Claim Notice with respect to a breach of
representation or warranty delivered hereunder after the expiration of the
applicable survival period of such representation or warranty set forth in
_Section 11.1_. Each party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses for which indemnification
is provided to it under this _ARTICLE 11_.

(iv) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this _ARTICLE 11_ shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds actually received

indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Person, it shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Person promptly for the amount of such insurance payment that
covers such Loss for which it has already received an indemnification payment.

any such amount expressly taken into account in determining any
accruals, reserves or provisions reflected in the final Closing Working
Capital.

such TEI Med Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification
hereunder, excluding amounts taken from the Escrow Fund, shall not exceed the
portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such TEI Med
Securityholder) and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses for which any TEI Med
Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification hereunder for fraud on

such TEI Med Securityholder is obligated to provide indemnification hereunder,
excluding amounts taken from the Escrow Fund, shall not exceed the portion of
the Purchase Price actually received by such TEI Med Securityholder).

(g) _Subject Matter_. The rights and remedies of an Indemnified Person based
upon any inaccuracy or breach of any provisions of this Agreement shall in no
way be limited by the fact that the facts upon which such Indemnified Persons

Agreement (including a provision as to which there is no inaccuracy for
breach).

(h) _Investigation_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained herein, and the rights of indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto, shall not be affected by any investigation conducted, or knowledge
acquired or deemed acquired, by or on behalf of any party.

have under this Agreement or for breach of this Agreement, at common law
or otherwise, except as provided in the Support Agreement with respect to
Joint Securityholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _ARTICLE
11_ shall restrict or limit any rights that a Parent-Side Indemnified Person
or a Securityholder-Side Indemnified Person may have to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief to prevent a breach of this Agreement or to
specifically enforce this Agreement.

 

(j) _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this
_ARTICLE 11_ shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price unless otherwise required by Law.

obligations of the TEI Med Securityholders under this Agreement for Losses
described in  _Section 11.2(a)(i)_, except ( _i_ ) for any indemnification
obligation arising out of ( _A_ ) fraud or ( _B_ ) breaches of Fundamental

by the TEI Med Securityholders by deducting such amount from the Closing
Merger Consideration.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless all past officers and directors of TEI Med (the "
_Covered Parties_ ") to the same extent and in the same manner and subject to
the same limits as such persons are indemnified as of the date of this
Agreement by TEI Med pursuant to the DGCL, TEI Meds certificate of
incorporation, TEI Meds by-laws and indemnification agreements between TEI
Med and such Covered Parties for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing obligations shall only
apply to the extent covered by the DandO Tail Policy.

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 12.3_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Covered Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns ( _i_ )
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its respective successors or assigns, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 12.3_.

 



     | 12.4 | _Tax Matters_ 
---|---|--- 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) TEI Med shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Med that are required to be filed
(taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date, and TEI Med
shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes of TEI Med due on or before the
Closing Date. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extension) for the filing of any such Tax Return
that is an income Tax Return, TEI Med shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return
to Parent for Parents review, and TEI Med shall consider in good faith any
reasonable comment that Parent submits to TEI Med no less than five (5)
Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return.

(ii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Med that relate to Tax Periods ending
on or before the Closing Date but that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date, and the Securityholders shall indemnify Parent (in accordance
with _ARTICLE 11_ ) for all Taxes due with respect to such

 



60  Tax Returns. At least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date
(taking into account any extension) for the filing of any such income Tax
Return, and at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (taking
into account any extension) for the filing of any other such Tax Return,
Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the SH Rep for the SH Reps
review. Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment that the
SH Rep submits to Parent no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due
date of such Tax Return.

(iii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns in respect of TEI Med that are required to be
filed for a Straddle Period. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due
date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of any such Tax
Return, Parent shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the SH Rep for the
SH Reps review. Parent shall consider in good faith any reasonable comment
relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period that the SH Rep submits to Parent no
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return.

(iv) With respect to Taxes of TEI Med relating to a Straddle Period, the
Securityholders shall indemnify Parent (in accordance with _ARTICLE 11_ ) for
the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that
is deemed to end on the Closing Date. The amount of Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period that
is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (A) in the case of property
Taxes and other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) in the case
of all other Taxes (other than Taxes covered by _Section 3.7_), determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Closing Date. For purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two
portions of the Straddle Period pursuant to this _Section 12.4(a)(iv)_, the
amount of any item that is taken into account only once for each Tax Period
(e.g., the benefit of graduated Tax rates, exemption amounts) shall be
allocated between the two portions of the Straddle Period in proportion to the
number of days in each portion. Any transactions that occur on the Closing
Date but after the Closing and that are not incurred in the ordinary course
of business of TEI Med (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) shall be considered allocable to a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(v) All Tax Returns described in this _Section 12.4(a)_, to the extent
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be prepared in accordance with
past custom and practice of TEI Med in preparing its Tax Returns, except to
the extent otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Cooperation_. Parent and the SH Rep agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to Taxes of TEI Med, including, without
limitation, access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns by Parent or the SH Rep, the preparation for
any audit by any Taxing Authority and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Each of Parent and the SH Rep
shall retain all books and records with respect to Taxes of TEI Med for a
period of at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date.

 



61 (c) _Notice of Tax Claims_. If a Governmental Authority shall commence any
audit, examination or other proceeding or make any claim relating to Taxes
that, if successful, might result in an indemnification payment pursuant to
_Section 11.2_ (a " _Tax Claim"_ ), Parent shall promptly give written notice
of such Tax Claim to the SH Rep, together with copies of all notices and
communications relating to such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the failure
of Parent to give such notice shall only relieve the Securityholders from
their indemnification obligations hereunder to the extent the Securityholders
demonstrate actual and material damage caused by such failure.

(d) _Control of Tax Claims_. The SH Rep shall, upon written notification to
Parent, control all proceedings at its own expense and may make all decisions
with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Tax Period ending on or before the
Closing Date; provided that the SH Rep shall not settle any such Tax Claim
without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) if the resolution of such Tax Claim
reasonably could be expected to affect the Tax liability of TEI Med for any
Post-Closing Tax Period. The SH Rep and Parent shall jointly control all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period, and
any such Tax Claim shall not be settled without the prior written consent of
both the SH Rep and Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). If the SH Rep declines to assume the defense of any
Tax Claim that it is entitled to control and defend pursuant to this 
_Section 12.4(d)_ after receipt of notice thereof, or if SH Rep is not
entitled to control or defend any Tax Claim pursuant to this _Section
12.4(d)_, Parent shall thereupon have the right to undertake the control,
defense and settlement of such Tax Claim; _provided_ that Parent shall not
settle any such Tax Claim without SH Reps prior written consent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this _Section 12.4(d)_, on the one hand,
and _Section 11.2(c)_, on the other hand, with respect to any Tax Claim, the
provisions of this _Section 12.4(d)_ shall control.

 

(e) _Refunds_. The TEI Med Securityholders shall be entitled to any refunds
(including any interest paid thereon) or credits in lieu of refunds of Taxes
of TEI Med attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, net of any reasonable
cost to Parent or its subsidiaries attributable to the obtaining and receipt
of such refund, provided that (1) such Taxes were paid by TEI Med at or prior
to the Closing or by a TEI Med Securityholder at or after the Closing, and (2)
such refund does not arise as a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax
benefit from a Post-Closing Tax Period. Parent and its Affiliates shall
reasonably cooperate with the SH Rep in obtaining any refund or credit to
which the TEI Med Securityholders are entitled under this _Section 12.4(e)_.
Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall promptly forward to or reimburse the
TEI Med Securityholders for any such refunds (including any interest paid
thereon) or credits due to the TEI Med Securityholders after receipt thereof.
To the extent such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to
be returned to the applicable Taxing Authority, the TEI Med Securityholders
shall promptly repay the amount of such refund, together with any interest
imposed by such Taxing Authority and any penalties or additional amounts
imposed by such Taxing Authority that are attributable to any action of the
TEI Med Securityholders, to Parent.

(f) _No Section 336(e) or 338 Election_. Parent agrees that it will not
make any election under Sections 336(e) or 338 of the Code, or any comparable
election under state or local law, with respect to the acquisition of TEI Med.

 

(g) _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit
TEI Med or any Affiliate to) file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return or Tax election relating in whole or in part to TEI Med or agree to the
waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations, with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the SH Rep (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



62 ---|---|--- 

Parent shall purchase and keep in place for a period of not less than three
(3) years after the Effective Time a successor products liability insurance
plan with a liability limit of not less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)
naming each of TEI Med and TEI Bio as named insureds.

the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in

(c) _Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, Waiver of Jury Trial_. This Agreement shall
be construed, governed and interpreted in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally: ( _i_ ) agrees that any dispute arising out
of this Agreement may be brought in any Chancery Court in the State of
Delaware, ( _ii_ ) consents to such jurisdiction; ( _iii_ ) waives any
objection to such venue and ( _iv_ ) waives trial by jury in any Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties could be irreparably harmed if any provision of this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that any breach of
this Agreement by a party could not be adequately compensated in all cases by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to
any other right or remedy to which the other parties may be entitled at law or
in equity, each party shall be entitled to seek to enforce any provision of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to obtain temporary,
preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches, without posting any bond or giving any other undertaking.

 

(e) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers; Assignment_. This Agreement and
the Additional Agreements, together with all schedules hereto and thereto
(including the Disclosure Schedule) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral
or written, except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
execution of this Agreement but, if the Closing occurs, be superseded in its
entirety effective as of the Closing. This Agreement may only be amended,
modified, supplemented or assigned by ( _i_ ) prior to the Effective Time, by
an agreement in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub Med

 



64  and TEI Med, or ( _ii_ ) after the Effective Time, an agreement in writing
signed by Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on one hand, and the SH Rep
(on behalf of the TEI Med Securityholders) on the other hand; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in each case, after Stockholder Approval of the Merger is
obtained, there shall be no amendment, waiver or assignment that, pursuant to
applicable Law, requires further approval of the Stockholders, without the
receipt of such further approvals. Any failure of Parent or Merger Sub Med, on
the one hand, or TEI Med on the other hand, to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived prior to the Closing by
TEI Med, and after the Closing by the SH Rep (with respect to any failure by
Parent or Merger Sub Med) or by Parent or Merger Sub Med (with respect to any
failure by TEI Med), respectively, only by a written instrument signed by
such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure. 

(f) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A manual signature on
this Agreement or any other document to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, an image of which shall been transmitted electronically, will
constitute an original signature for all purposes.

(g) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement or
in any Additional Agreement, each party shall pay its own legal, accounting
and out-of-pocket and other expenses incident to the negotiation and execution
of, and Closing under, this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
Transaction Expenses described under subclause (a) of such definition shall
be paid as contemplated by _ARTICLE 3_.

(h) _Invalidity and Severability_. If any provision contained in this
Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, then,
to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement. Should any portion,
provision or clause of this Agreement be deemed too broad to permit
enforcement to its full extent then it shall be enforced to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, and the parties consent and agree that such scope may be
judicially modified accordingly in any Proceeding brought to enforce such
portion, provision or clause.

(i) _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of any party are cumulative of each other
and of every other right or remedy such party may otherwise have at Law or in
equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.

(j)  _Incorporation of Schedules_. The schedules (including the Disclosure
Schedule) that are attached to this Agreement are a part of this Agreement and
are incorporated herein by reference.

 

(k) _Further Assurances_. Without limiting any other obligation hereunder,
each party shall upon request execute and deliver to any other party such
other documents, and do such other acts and things, including filing any
forms, notifications or reports with

 



65  Governmental Authorities, in each case as such requesting party may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement, the Additional Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

(l) _Attorney-Client Privilege; Future Representation; Parties Other than TEI
Med_. Parent and Merger Sub Med hereby acknowledge that Wilmer Cutler
Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP (" _WilmerHale_ ") has acted as counsel to TEI Med
in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The following
provisions apply to the attorney-client relationship between ( _i_ ) TEI Med
and WilmerHale prior to Closing and ( _ii_ ) the TEI Med Securityholders (and
any subset of them) and WilmerHale following Closing. Each TEI Med
Securityholder hereby agrees that it will not seek to disqualify WilmerHale
from acting as counsel to any of the TEI Med Securityholders either in the
event of a dispute hereunder or in the course of the defense or prosecution of
any claim relating to the transactions contemplated herein because of its
representation of TEI Med in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein. Parent and Merger Sub Med agree that the TEI Med Securityholders who
are employees of TEI Med have a reasonable expectation of privacy
with respect to their communications (including any e-mail communications
using the e-mail system of TEI Med) with WilmerHale prior to the Closing to
the extent such communications concern the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub Med further agree that for the purposes of
the attorney-client privilege, any communications between WilmerHale and TEI
Med or the TEI Med Securityholders who are employees of TEI Med that were made
in the course of negotiating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that relate to the subject matter of this Agreement or that may be
relevant to any claims for indemnification under this Agreement or any other
dispute arising in connection with this Agreement or any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document executed or delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby (" _Protected
Communications_ ") shall be deemed privileged communications of the TEI
Med Securityholders who are employees of TEI Med for the purposes of such
claims or disputes, and to the extent that they may not be considered as such
at law, Parent and Merger Sub Med hereto agree to contractually treat such
Protected Communications as if they were privileged communications of the TEI
Med Securityholders who are employees of TEI Med.
