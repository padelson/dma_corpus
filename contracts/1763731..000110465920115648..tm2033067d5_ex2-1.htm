Pre-Closing Purchaser Cash,  _multiplied by_ (B) the quotient of (1) the

equal to the product of (A) the Pre-Closing Purchaser Cash, _multiplied by_
(B) the quotient of (I) the number of Participating Company Units owned by
Blocker GP as of immediately following the Company Equity Reclassification,
_divided by_ (II) the Pre-Closing Outstanding Units (such cash, the "
_Blocker GP Sale Consideration_ ") and, upon the sale and transfer of such
Blocker GP Sold Units and notwithstanding any provision of the limited
liability company operating agreement of the Company or otherwise to the
contrary, Purchaser shall be a member of the Company holding such Blocker GP
Sold Units and the Company shall continue without dissolution;

each of the fiscal years of Purchaser referred to in clause (i) above, (iii)
all other forms, reports, registration statements, prospectuses and other
documents (other than preliminary materials) filed by Purchaser with the SEC
since the beginning of the first fiscal year referred to in clause (i) above
(the forms, reports, registration statements, prospectuses and other
documents referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and this clause (iii),
whether or not available through EDGAR, collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ ")
and (iv) all certifications and statements required by (A) Rules 13a-14 or
15d-14 under the Exchange Act, and (B) 18 U.S.C.  §1350 (Section 906 of SOX)
with respect to any report referred to in clause (i) above (collectively, the
" _Public Certifications_ "). The SEC Reports (x) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (y) did not, as of their respective effective dates (in the
case of SEC Reports that are registration statements filed pursuant to
the requirements of the Securities Act) and at the time they were filed with
the SEC (in the case of all other SEC Reports) contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of
the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to Purchaser or the SEC
Reports. As of the date hereof, (i) none of the SEC Reports is the subject of
ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comments and (ii) neither the SEC nor
any other Governmental Entity is conducting any investigation or review of
any SEC Report. The Public Certifications are each true as of their
respective dates of filing. As used in this _Section 7.05_, the term "file"
shall be broadly construed to include any manner permitted by SEC rules and
regulations in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or
otherwise made available to the SEC.

  



  

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated
by reference in the SEC Reports, fairly present in all material respects the
financial position and the results of operations, changes in shareholders'
equity, and cash flows of Purchaser at the respective dates of and, for the
periods referred to in such financial statements, all in accordance with (i)
GAAP methodologies applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto and for the omission of notes and audit
adjustments in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements to the
extent permitted by Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable).

(c) Purchaser has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and
paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Purchaser's disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial
and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Purchaser's management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Purchaser's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
Purchaser's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable SEC Report, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. Based on Purchaser's management's most
recently completed evaluation of Purchaser's internal control over financial
reporting, (i) Purchaser had no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Purchaser's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) Purchaser does not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting.

  



  

(d) There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit
made by Purchaser to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of Purchaser. Purchaser has not taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

Section 7.06 _No Undisclosed Liabilities; No Business or Operations_.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any
kind, other than those reflected on the Financial Statements or as
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements. Other than filing reports with
the SEC or the evaluation, negotiation and consummation of the Transactions,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any business or
operations.

  



  

Section 7.07 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the date of
Purchaser's formation, (i) there has not been any change, development,
condition, occurrence, event or effect relating to Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, resulted in, or would
reasonably be expected to result in, a material adverse effect on the ability
of Purchaser to enter into, perform its obligations under this Agreement and
consummate the Transactions and (ii) from December 31, 2019 through the date
of this Agreement, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have not taken any action
that (A) would require the consent of the Company pursuant to _Section 8.02_
if such action had been taken after the date hereof or (B) is material
to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

Section 7.08 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Except as may be contemplated by
the Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Subsidiaries maintains, contributes to or has any obligation or liability, or
could reasonably be expected to have any obligation or liability, under, any
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
including each, if any exists, (i) pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA) or post-retirement or employment health, medical, life insurance or
other benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, (ii) bonus,
incentive or deferred compensation, stock purchase, stock option, or other
equity-based compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) employment, individual consulting, severance, separation,
change in control or retention plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement or (iv) other fringe benefit compensation, benefit or employee
loan plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Benefit Plans_ ") and neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with another event) will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise)
becoming due to any shareholder, director, officer or employee of Purchaser
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) will result in the acceleration, vesting
or creation of any rights of any shareholder, director, officer or employee
of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to payments or benefits or increases
in any existing payments or benefits or any loan forgiveness.

  



  

Section 7.09 _Proceedings_. There are no Actions of any kind whatsoever,
at Law or in equity, pending, or to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in
writing against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Brokers and Finders_. No agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is or will become entitled to receive any
commission, brokerage, finder's fee or other similar compensation in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Purchaser.

Section 7.11 _Financial Ability; Trust Account_.

  



  

(a) As of the date hereof, there is at least $287,500,000 invested
in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust Account_ "),
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, a New York
corporation, acting as trustee (the " _Trustee_ "), pursuant to the
Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated April 3, 2019, by and between
Purchaser and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the Trustee, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity. The Trust Agreement has not been terminated,
repudiated, rescinded, amended or supplemented or modified, in any respect,
and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, no such termination, repudiation,
rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is contemplated. There are
no Contracts with the Trustee or any other Person that would (i) cause the
description of the Trust Agreement in the SEC Reports to be inaccurate or
(ii) entitle any Person (other than any Purchaser Stockholder who is a
Redeeming Stockholder) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account.
Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may
be released except in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Memorandum and
Articles of Association and Purchaser's final prospectus dated April 5, 2019.
Amounts in the Trust Account are invested in United States Government
securities or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Purchaser
has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date
under, and is not in material default, breach or delinquent in performance or
any other respect (claimed or actual) in connection with, the Trust Agreement,
and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default or breach thereunder. There are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened with respect to the
Trust Account. Since April 3, 2019, Purchaser has not released any money from
the Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the principal held in
the Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement or the payment of
Purchaser's income taxes as permitted in the Purchaser Organizational
Documents). As of the Closing, the obligations of Purchaser to dissolve or
liquidate pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Purchaser
Organizational Documents or any other Contract shall terminate, and, as of
the Closing, Purchaser shall have no obligation whatsoever to dissolve and
liquidate the assets of Purchaser by reason of the consummation of the
Transactions. Following the Closing, no Purchaser Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such Purchaser Stockholder is a Redeeming Stockholder.

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company herein and the compliance by
the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, Purchaser has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust
Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Trust Account will not
be available to Purchaser on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) As of the date hereof, Purchaser does not have, or have any
present intention, agreement, arrangement or understanding to enter into or
incur, any obligations with respect to or under any Indebtedness.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Investment Purposes_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser is purchasing the Participating Company Units and,
indirectly, the equity interests of the Company's Subsidiaries, for its own
account for investment purposes and not with a view toward distribution or re-
sale in violation of the Securities Act, and all other applicable securities
Laws, rules or regulations. Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined
in Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Purchaser
acknowledges that it is informed as to the risks of the Transactions and of
ownership of the Participating Company Units.

  



  

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that none of the Participating Company
Units or the equity interests of the Company's Subsidiaries has been or will
be registered under federal Law or qualified under state Law, but rather are
being offered for sale in accordance with certain exemptions under applicable
Law and that the Participating Company Units and the Subsidiary equity may not
be resold by it unless they are subsequently registered or qualified under
applicable Law, or an exemption from registration and qualification is then
available.

material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

not misleading; _provided_ ,  _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing

(c) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received

(j) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability for the Taxes of any person, other than Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor or
otherwise as a matter of Law.

Section 8.04 _Publicity_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company
and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall communicate and cooperate with each
other prior to any press release or public disclosure of the Transactions.
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company and the Sellers, on the other
hand, agree that no public release or announcement concerning the terms of the
Transactions shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), except such release or announcement as may be required by
Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the
securities of one of the Company's or any Seller's Affiliates or Purchaser or
one of its Affiliates are listed, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Purchaser, the Sellers and the Company are
permitted to (A) report and disclose the status and terms (including price
terms) of this Agreement and the Transactions to their (or in the case of any
Seller or the Company, its sponsors') direct or indirect limited partners if
required by those governing documents with those limited partners and
otherwise in the ordinary course of their business and (B) disclose the
consummation of the Transactions (but not, without the consent of the other
parties, price terms or the name of such other parties) on their websites and
otherwise in the ordinary course of their business and (ii) the Company and
the Sellers are permitted to report and disclose the status of this Agreement
and the Transactions pursuant to an internal communication or otherwise to
its employees.

  



  

Section 8.05 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it,
its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions are subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between UFG Holdings LLC and Purchaser, dated as of
August 17, 2020 (as amended or modified from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement
are hereby incorporated by reference.

  



  

   

73

 



    



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Purchaser, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries shall treat and hold as confidential any
information regarding any Seller, Blocker or Blocker GP or any of its
respective Affiliates in their businesses distinct from the Business (such
information, the " _Confidential Information_ ") and refrain from using any of
the Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, or as may otherwise be required by Law, in connection
with any dispute with third parties or any defense or prosecution of legal
proceedings, financial reporting, Tax or accounting matters.

  



  

Section 8.06 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and
_Section 8.05_, Purchaser shall be entitled, through its officers, employees
and Representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to have
such access to the properties, businesses and operations of the Company and
such examination of the books and records of the Company, as it reasonably
requests upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with
Purchaser's efforts to consummate the Transactions. Any such access and
examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under
circumstances that do not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the business and shall be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. The Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective
officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other
Representatives to cooperate with Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives
in connection with such access and examination, and the Company and its
Representatives, as the case may be, shall cooperate with Purchaser and its
Representatives, as the case may be, and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to minimize any disruption to the Business. Any disclosure during such
investigation by the Company or its Representatives shall not constitute any
enlargement or additional representation or warranty of any Seller-Side Party
beyond those specifically set forth in _Article IV_, _Article V_ or
_Article VI_, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent that
it (i) relates to interactions with other prospective buyers of the Company
or the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions, (ii) would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of any Seller, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or (iii) would require any Seller, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to disclose information that, in the
reasonable judgment and good faith of counsel to such Seller or the Company,
is subject to attorney-client privilege or may conflict with any applicable
Law or confidentiality obligations to which such Seller or the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries is bound.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
prior to the Closing, (i) without the written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not contact any customers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary course of business of Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and provided that the applicable Seller or the Company shall
have the right to have a Representative present during any such contact in the
event that it consents to such contact, and (ii) Purchaser shall not have any
right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties or
facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Company.

Section 8.07 _Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things
necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws, to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions, including providing any
notices to any Person required in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions, and obtaining any licenses, consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and Governmental Orders necessary to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , that in no event shall any party be
required to pay any material fee, penalty or other consideration to obtain any
license, Permit, consent, approval, authorization, qualification or waiver
required under any Contract for the consummation of the Transactions (other
than fees or expenses payable to the SEC in connection with the Transactions,
including the Registration Statement, filing fees payable pursuant to the
HSR Act or other Competition Laws, and any other ordinary course filing fees
in connection with Governmental Filings required to consummate the
Transactions). Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections and
applicable Competition Laws, each party hereto shall furnish to the other
parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate with one another
and use their reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary
documentation (including furnishing all information (i) required under any
applicable Competition Laws or other applicable Laws or (ii) requested by a
Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Competition Laws) to effect
promptly all necessary filings with any Governmental Entity and to obtain all
necessary, proper or advisable actions or nonactions, approvals consents,
waivers, exemptions and approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Transactions. Each party hereto shall provide to the other
parties copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any
Governmental Entity relating to the Transactions or any of the
matters described in this _Section 8.07_. Each of the parties hereto shall
promptly inform the other of any substantive oral communication with, and
provide copies of any written communications with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any such filings or any such transaction, unless prohibited by
reasonable request of any Governmental Entity. No party hereto shall
independently participate in any meeting or substantive conference call with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting or
substantive conference call and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, the opportunity to attend or participate. In the event a party is
prohibited from participating in or attending any meeting or substantive
conference call, the participating party shall keep the other party promptly
and reasonably apprised with respect thereto, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, the parties
hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating
to proceedings under Competition Laws or other applicable Laws. Any documents
or other materials provided pursuant to this _Section 8.07(b)_ may be
redacted or withheld as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns, and to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company or other competitively sensitive material or personally-
identifiable information or other sensitive personal or financial
information, and the parties may, as each deems advisable, reasonably
designate any material provided under this _Section 8.07_ as "outside
counsel only material." Such "outside counsel only materials" and the
information contained therein shall be given only to legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such legal counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the party providing such materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
party shall be obligated to share with the other party documents
responsive to items 4(c) and 4(d) on the Notification and Report Form for
Certain Mergers and Acquisitions under the HSR Act.

  



  

   

75

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant
to this _Section 8.07_, each party hereto shall use reasonable best efforts
to provide or cause to be provided (including, with respect to filings
pursuant to the HSR Act, by its "Ultimate Parent Entities", as that term is
defined in the HSR Act) as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
Governmental Entity information and documents relating to such party as
requested by such Governmental Entity or necessary, proper or advisable
to permit consummation of the Transactions, including filing any notification
and report form and related material required under the HSR Act and any other
filing or notice that may be required with any other Governmental Entity as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and, in the case of
filings under the HSR Act, no later than 10 Business Days after the date
hereof), and thereafter to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any request for additional information or documentary material relating to
such party that may be made (including under the HSR Act and any similar
Competition Law regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of
competition reviews). Each of the Company and Purchaser shall supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
relating to such party that may be requested by any Governmental Entity
and furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required
applications, notices, registrations and requests as may be required or
advisable to be filed with any Governmental Entity (including, with respect
to Purchaser and its Affiliates, providing financial information and
certificates as well as personal information of senior management or control
persons, and making individuals with appropriate seniority and expertise
available to participate in discussions or hearings). Purchaser shall cause
the filings made by it (or by its Ultimate Parent Entity, if applicable)
under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination," and make
any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or
advisable in connection therewith.

  



  

(d) Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided, all
agreements, documents, instruments, affidavits, statements or information that
may be required or requested by any Governmental Entity relating to (i)
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including any of its, or its Affiliates',
directors, officers, employees, partners, members or shareholders), (ii) all
Persons who are deemed or may be deemed to "control" Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries within the meaning of applicable Mortgage Laws and (iii)
Purchaser's and its Affiliates' structure, ownership, businesses, operations,
regulatory and legal compliance, assets, liabilities, financing, financial
condition or results of operations, or any of its or their directors,
officers, employees, partners, members or shareholders.

  



  

   

76

 



    



  

(e) If any objections are asserted with respect to the
Transactions under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted by any
Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the Transactions
as violative of any applicable Law, each of the parties hereto shall, at the
sole cost and expense of Purchaser, cooperate with one another in good faith
and use their reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend against any
action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the
Transactions), and (ii) take such action as reasonably necessary to overturn
any regulatory action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the Transactions), including by defending
any Action brought by any Governmental Entity in order to avoid entry of, or
to have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary,
in order to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to any of the Transactions under such
applicable Law so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions in their
entity.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, take any and all actions necessary to
obtain any authorization, consent or approval of a Governmental Entity
(including in connection with any Governmental Filings) necessary or
advisable so as to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as
expeditiously as possible (and in any event, no later than the Outside Date)
and to resolve, avoid or eliminate any impediments or objections, if any, that
may be asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Law, or to
otherwise oppose, avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
order, decree, judgment, preliminary or permanent injunction that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing, prohibiting, restricting, or
delaying the consummation of the Transactions, including: (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of, or
holding separate of, businesses, product lines, rights or assets of Purchaser
or its controlled Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
any interest therein (including entering into customary ancillary agreements
relating to any such sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition of such
businesses, product lines, rights or assets) and (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit
Purchaser's or its controlled Affiliates' (including the Company's and its
Subsidiaries'), freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or
control, one or more of the businesses, product lines, rights or assets of
Purchaser and its controlled Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or interest therein, in each case as may be required in order
to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as expeditiously
as possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date).

  



  

(g) From the date of this Agreement until Closing, neither
Purchaser nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall acquire or agree to
acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or any equity in, or by any other
manner, any assets or Person, if the execution and delivery of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition could in any
material respect (individually or in the aggregate): (i) impose any delay in
obtaining, or increase the risk of not obtaining, consents of a Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) increase the risk of a
Governmental Entity seeking or entering a Governmental Order prohibiting the
consummation of the Transactions, (iii) increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such Governmental Order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) otherwise
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall require any Seller-Side Party to (i) take,
or cause to be taken, any action with respect to Blackstone or any of its
Affiliates, including any affiliated investment funds or any portfolio
company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry)
of Blackstone or any of its Affiliates, including selling, divesting or
otherwise disposing of, or conveying, licensing, holding separate or otherwise
restricting or limiting its freedom of action with respect to, any assets,
business, products, rights, licenses or investments, or interests therein,
other than with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) provide,
or cause to be provided, (A) nonpublic or other confidential financial or
sensitive personally identifiable information of Blackstone, its Affiliates or
its or their respective directors, officers, employees, managers or partners,
or its or their respective control persons' or direct or indirect
equityholders' and their respective directors', officers', employees',
managers' or partners' (each of the foregoing Persons, a " _Blackstone
Related Person_ ") nonpublic or other confidential financial or sensitive
personally identifiable information (other than such information with respect
to the officers and directors of the Company which may be provided to a
Governmental Entity on a confidential basis) or (B) any other nonpublic,
proprietary or other confidential information of a Blackstone Related Person
that exceeds the scope of information that such Blackstone Related Person has
historically supplied in connection with a similar governmental filing or
notification.

  



  

Section 8.08 _Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may
have under any Company Benefit Plan, from the Closing through the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless each present (as of immediately prior to the Closing) and
former officer, director, manager, general partner, agent, employee or
fiduciary of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Indemnified Individuals_ ") from and against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, (i) by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Individual is or
was an officer, director, manager, general partner, agent, employee or
fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
(including this Agreement and the other transactions and actions contemplated
hereby and the enforcement of any such Indemnified Individual's rights under
this _Section 8.08 _or otherwise), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. In
the event of any such Action, (x) each Indemnified Individual will be entitled
to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the
Company within ten Business Days of receipt by the Company from such
Indemnified Individual of a request therefor, (y) the Company shall not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Action or
threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Individual hereunder) without the consent of such Indemnified
Individual unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Individual from all liability
arising out of such Action and (z) the Company shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

(b) The Organizational Documents of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or
present (as of immediately prior to the Closing) directors, managers,
officers and general partners of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are set
forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Closing in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and New Pubco
shall cause Purchaser to, maintain (or cause its Affiliates to maintain) the
existing insurance policies with the level and scope of directors' and
officers' liability insurance as applicable to the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing for a period of six (6)
years following the Closing (such period, the " _Tail Insurance Period_ ")
and covering those persons who served as a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, who were covered by a
Seller's, the Company's or their respective Affiliates' directors' and
officers' liability insurance prior to the Closing. If, for any reason, any
such insurance policy is anticipated to lapse or cease to be effective prior
to the end of the Tail Insurance Period, Purchaser shall, and New Pubco shall
cause Purchaser to, with respect to any insurance policy covering those
persons who served as a director or officer of the Company or any its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, purchase or cause to be purchased a tail
policy with the level and scope of directors' and officers' liability
insurance as applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, as of immediately prior to the Closing covering those persons serving as a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action
(whether arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against any
Indemnified Individual on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing,
the provisions of this _Section 8.08_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

  



  

(e) The covenants in this _Section 8.08_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Individuals and their respective heirs and legal representatives.
The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which an Indemnified Individual is entitled, whether pursuant
to law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Company, New Pubco or Purchaser or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
a majority of its properties and assets to any Person or effects any division
transaction or similar transaction, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 8.08_. In addition, the Company shall not distribute, sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its assets (whether by merger,
consolidation, division or otherwise) in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to render the Company unable to satisfy its obligations under this
_Section 8.08_.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

Section 8.09 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Without limiting the parties'
obligations under _Section 8.07_, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions, to do or cause to be done and to assist and
cooperate with the other party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including: (a) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties; (b) (i) the preparation and filing, in consultation with the other
parties, as promptly as reasonably practicable with any Governmental Entity
or other third party all documentation to effect all necessary, proper or
advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions
of information, applications and other documents and (ii) the obtaining and
maintaining of all approvals, consents, waivers, registrations, permits,
authorizations and other confirmations required to be obtained from any
Governmental Entity or other third party, in each case of the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the Transactions; (c) the defending of any
Actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the obligations
hereby; and (d) the execution and delivery of such instruments, and the
taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably require in
order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Company, any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be obligated to make any payments or otherwise pay any
consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable consent, waiver or
approval.

  



  

Section 8.10 _Preservation of Records_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Company to, preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the
Business for a period of seven years following the Closing Date (or longer if
required by applicable Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and
reasonably appropriate personnel available, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice, to the Seller Representative as may be reasonably
required by the Seller Representative in connection with any insurance
claims by, legal proceedings or Tax audits against, governmental
investigations of, or compliance with applicable Laws by, any Seller or any
of its Affiliates.

  



  

   

80

 



    



  

Section 8.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Intended Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_. The
parties intend that (i) effective with the date of the Domestication,
Purchaser will elect on Form 8832 to be treated as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Domestication qualifies as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and that this
Agreement shall be adopted as a plan of reorganization, (ii) the Mergers, the
Blocker GP Contribution, the PIPE and the New Pubco Class B Common Stock
Subscription, taken together, shall qualify as a contribution to New Pubco by
Blocker GP, the owners of the Blocker immediately prior to Closing and the
Sellers of Blocker Shares and/or Cash (as applicable) and by the owners of
Purchaser of the equity of Purchaser pursuant to Section 351 of the Code, and
(iii) any issuances of New Pubco Shares or Participating Company Units
pursuant to _Section 3.04_ of this Agreement shall be treated as a non-
taxable adjustment to the Equity Value Amount (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii),
collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "). The Seller
Representative shall prepare and deliver to New Pubco, within ninety (90)
days of the Closing Date, an allocation of the Sellers' aggregate Cash
Consideration and the Blocker GP Sale Consideration and any other amounts
treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the
Company's assets in accordance with and Section 1060 (and Section 751 and 755,
if applicable) of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). New Pubco shall have thirty (30) days from
the receipt of the Allocation to review and comment on the Allocation and New
Pubco and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
any disagreements; provided, that if New Pubco does not provide any
comments in writing to the Seller Representative within such period, such
Allocation as delivered by the Seller Representative shall become final. Any
disputes under this _Section 8.11(a)_ that cannot be resolved through good
faith negotiation shall be referred to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accountant_ "), whose determination shall be final and binding upon the
parties. The cost of the Accountant's review and determination shall be borne
by New Pubco and the Seller Representative based on the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded in favor of each such Person
bears to the amount actually contested by such Person. The parties agree that
the Domestication shall be treated as a transaction described in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.367(b)-3, and shall reasonable cooperate in furnishing
U.S. shareholders of Purchaser with the information necessary to comply with
their reporting obligations under such provision, and to make qualified
electing fund elections under Section 1295 of the Code. The Seller
Representative and New Pubco shall report consistently with the Intended Tax
Treatment and the Allocation on all Tax Returns, and no party shall take any
position in any Tax Return or with any Governmental Entity that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment or Allocation, as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 8.11(a)_ in each case, unless
required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section 1313 of the
Code.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) New Pubco shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for Blocker and the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be filed after the Closing and shall make all
payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Blocker GP may, at
its election, prepare and file (or cause Blocker to file) any information Tax
Returns with respect to any distributions or payments to the owners
of Blocker prior to Closing. With respect to any Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period that are of the type used to report
the income, loss, gain, deduction and other Tax attributes from the operation
of a partnership or other pass-through entity and that are of the type that
could reflect items of income, loss, gain, deduction or other Tax attributes
required to be included on a Tax Return of a Seller (whether or not such
items are actually reflected thereon) (a " _Pass-Through Tax Return_ "), (w)
such Pass-Through Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law, (x) New Pubco shall
submit such Tax Return to the Seller Representative no later than thirty (30)
days prior to filing any such Pass-Through Tax Return for its review, (y) New
Pubco shall make any changes to such Pass-Through Tax Return reasonably
requested by the Seller Representative and (z) no such Pass-Through Tax
Return shall be filed without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company (and any
Subsidiary of the Company that is a partnership for U.S. federal (or other
applicable) tax purposes) shall have in effect an election under Section 754
of the Code (and any similar election under state or local law) for the
taxable period which includes the Closing Date.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

(ii) The parties agree that in connection with the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns of or with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, deductions and/or losses of or with
respect to Indebtedness and Outstanding Company Expenses (or amounts that
would have been Outstanding Company Expenses except they were paid prior to
the Closing) shall be claimed in taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending
on or before the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _Allocation of Taxes_. The portion of any Taxes for a
Straddle Period allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are
based upon or related to income or receipts, payroll or other similar levels
of activities or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property, other than Transfer Taxes, the amount which would be
payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case
of other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the
amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending with
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire period; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
incurred in connection with the Pre-Closing Reorganization, including Taxes
incurred as a result of Sections 707, 704(c)(1)(B), 737 and Section 481(a) of
the Code with respect to any transaction occurring prior to the Closing, shall
be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date. For purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of
a taxable period pursuant to this _Section 8.11(c)_, the amount of any item
that is taken into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the
benefit of graduated tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated
between the two portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in
each portion. The parties agree that all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit allocable among the members of the Company for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date shall be allocated by taking into
account the member's varying interests during such taxable year in accordance
with Section 706(d) of the Code using the "interim closing of the books"
method.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation of Tax Matters_. The Sellers, Purchaser and New
Pubco shall cooperate reasonably in connection with the filing of any Tax
Returns and any Tax Proceeding or other audit or claim with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and information with
respect to Blocker, the Company or any Subsidiary which are reasonably
relevant to any Tax Proceeding or other audit or claim. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Sellers, Purchaser and New Pubco will cooperate reasonably and
use reasonable best efforts to have the now-current officers, directors and
employees of the Company or any Subsidiary cooperate in
furnishing information, evidence, testimony and other assistance in
connection with the filing of any Tax Return or any Tax Proceeding or other
audit or claim.

  



  

   

82

 



    



  

(e) _Tax Proceedings_.

  



  

(i) If a written notice of deficiency, audit, examination, or
other administrative or judicial proceeding, in each case with respect to
Taxes of Blocker, the Company or any Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or Straddle Period (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") is received from a Governmental
Entity by New Pubco or any of its Affiliates, New Pubco shall give the Seller
Representative written notice of such Tax Proceeding within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of such notice.

  



  

(ii) The Seller Representative shall have the right, at its own
expense, to control any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Pass-Through Tax
Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, the Seller
Representative shall inform New Pubco of the status of any such Tax
Proceeding, shall provide New Pubco (at New Pubco's cost and expense) with
copies of any pleadings, correspondence and other documents as New Pubco may
reasonably request and shall reasonably consult with New Pubco prior to the
settlement of any such proceedings and shall obtain the prior written consent
of New Pubco prior to the settlement of any such proceedings that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect New Pubco or the Company or any
Subsidiary in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; provided, further,
that New Pubco, at its own expense, shall have the right to participate in,
but not direct, the prosecution or defense of any such Tax
Proceedings controlled by the Seller Representative; and provided further,
with respect to any such Pass-Through Tax Return, the Seller
Representative shall, or shall cause the applicable Company or Subsidiary of
the Company to, make any available election under Code Section 6226 and
corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign law, and to make such
allocations and issue such notices, as are necessary to give effect to such
election.

  



  

(iii) New Pubco shall have the right, at its own expense, to
control any other Tax Proceeding with respect to Blocker, the Company or
any Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period;
_provided_ , that in the case of any such Tax Proceeding with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period and which is not otherwise
controlled by the Seller Representative in accordance with this _Section
8.11(e)_, New Pubco shall keep the Seller Representative reasonably informed
of the status of any such Tax Proceeding, shall provide the Seller
Representative (at the Seller Representative's cost and expense) with copies
of any pleadings, correspondence and other documents as the Seller
Representative may reasonably request, and shall consult with the Seller
Representative prior to the settlement of any such proceedings and shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Seller Representative prior to the
settlement of any such proceedings that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Seller Representative or any of its Affiliates, which
consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed; provided,
further, that the Seller Representative, at its own expense, shall have the
right to participate in, but not direct, the prosecution or defense of any
such Tax Proceeding controlled by New Pubco that relates a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Straddle Period.

  



  

   

83

 



    



  

(f) _Refunds_. The Seller Representative shall be entitled to, on
behalf of the Sellers and Blocker GP, the amount of any refund or credit
of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, on behalf of Blocker
GP and the owners of Blocker as of immediately prior to the Blocker Merger,
any refund or credit of Taxes of Blocker, in each case with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (allocated in accordance with
_Section 8.11(c)_). New Pubco shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Seller
Representative any amount to which it is entitled pursuant to this _Section
8.11(f)_ within five (5) calendar days of the receipt or recognition (by
means of an actual reduction in Taxes otherwise currently payable) of the
applicable refund or credit by New Pubco or any of its Affiliates. To the
extent requested by the Seller Representative, New Pubco will reasonably
cooperate in obtaining such refund or credit, including through the filing of
amended Tax Returns for periods ending before or on the Closing Date or
refund claims.

  



  

(g) _Post-Closing Actions_. Neither New Pubco or any of its
Affiliates (including Purchaser and, after the Closing, Blocker, the Company,
or any of its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative, (i) make, change or revoke any Tax election affecting
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (ii) amend, refile or otherwise
modify (or grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations with
respect to) any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period, (iii) file or request any ruling with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or enter into any voluntary
disclosure with any Governmental Entity regarding any Tax or Tax Returns of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case relating to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or (iv) take any action that results in
any increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax asset of the Sellers,
Blocker GP and the owners of Blocker as of immediately prior to the Blocker
Merger in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period.

  



  

(h) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes
incurred in connection with the Transactions. The party required to do so as
a matter of applicable Law shall, at its own expense, timely file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, the other parties will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  



  

(i) _FIRPTA Certificate; Tax Forms_. At or prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall have received (i) a duly executed certificate and notice in
compliance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c) and 1.897- 2(h),

Section 8.12 _Registration Statement; Special Meeting_.

  



  

(a) Subject to receipt of the PCAOB Audited Financials, as
promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (and, in any event, no later than 30 days following the date
hereof), New Pubco shall use its reasonable best efforts to prepare, with the
assistance of Purchaser and the Company, and cause to be filed with the SEC,
the Registration Statement. Each of New Pubco, Purchaser and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act and the Proxy Statement cleared of SEC comments as promptly as
practicable after the filing of the Registration Statement, and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Transactions. New Pubco also shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" approvals required to
consummate the Transactions. Each of New Pubco, Purchaser and the Company

the Proxy Statement to be mailed to stockholders of Purchaser.

  



  

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement will be made by New Pubco without providing Purchaser and the

New Pubco, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate and mutually agree upon
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) any
response to comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration
Statement and any amendment to the Registration Statement filed in
response thereto. If New Pubco, Purchaser or the Company becomes aware that
any information contained in the Registration Statement shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or that the Registration Statement
is required to be amended in order to comply with applicable Law, then (i)
such party shall promptly inform the other parties and (ii) each of New
Pubco, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate and mutually agree upon
(such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. New Pubco, Purchaser
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of Purchaser Shares, in each case pursuant to
applicable Law and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Organizational Documents of Purchaser. Each of New Pubco and Purchaser
shall provide the Company with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform the Company of any oral comments, that it receives from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Registration Statement promptly after the receipt
of such comments, and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any proposed written or oral responses to such comments
prior to responding to the SEC or its staff. Each of New Pubco, Purchaser and
the Company shall ensure that none of the information supplied by or on its
behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC,
at each time at which it is amended and at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, not misleading or (B) the Proxy Statement
will, at the date it is first mailed to stockholders of Purchaser and at the
time of the Special Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

other issuance that is subject to related party transaction rules) (all such
approvals, collectively, the " _Issuance Proposal_ "), (iv) approval of an
extension of the date by which Purchaser must consummate a Business
Combination to October 8, 2021 (or, if elected by the Company prior to the

Act, such other date designated by the Company) to be effected by way of
amendment and restatement of the Memorandum and Articles of Association (the
" _Extension Proposal_ "), (v) approval of the adoption of the Omnibus
Incentive Plan (the " _Omnibus Incentive Plan Proposal_ ") and (vi) approval
of any other proposals that are required to be made and approved in order to
consummate the Transactions and any other proposals that are reasonably agreed
between Purchaser and the Company to be appropriate in connection with the
Transactions (together with the Cayman Proposals, the Amendment Proposal, the
Issuance Proposal, the Extension Proposal and the Omnibus Incentive Plan
Proposal, the " _Proposals_ "). Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Proposals shall be the only matters (other than procedural
matters) which Purchaser shall propose to be acted on by Purchaser
Stockholders at the Special Meeting. Purchaser shall file any special
resolutions with the Registrar with respect to the Cayman Proposals, such
special resolutions to be forwarded to the Registrar within 15 days

convene and hold the Special Meeting in accordance with applicable Law, (ii)
cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to Purchaser Stockholders in
compliance with applicable Law and (iii) solicit proxies from shareholders
of Purchaser to vote in favor of each of the Proposals. Purchaser shall,
through the Purchaser Board, recommend to its stockholders that they approve
each of the Proposals (the " _Purchaser Board Recommendation_ ") and shall
include the Purchaser Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The
Purchaser Board shall not (and no committee or subgroup thereof
shall) change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the Purchaser Board
Recommendation. Once notice of the Special Meeting has been given, without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), (x) Purchaser shall not cancel, recess,
adjourn, postpone or delay the Special Meeting and (y) neither the Purchaser
Board nor any committee or subcommittee thereof shall change the record date
for determining stockholders of Purchaser entitled to notice of or to vote at

shall have the right to adjourn the Special Meeting on a single occasion to a
date that is not five Business Days later than the originally scheduled date
of the Special Meeting; _provided_ , _further_ , that in connection with such
adjournment, (A) neither the Purchaser Board nor any committee or subcommittee
shall change the record date for determining stockholders of Purchaser
entitled to notice of or to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment
and (B) the Purchaser Board shall direct that the date, time and place (or
means of remote communication) of the adjournment be announced at the Special
Meeting. Following the adjournment of the Special Meeting in accordance with
the immediately preceding two provisos, Purchaser (I) shall cause a
supplement to the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to Purchaser
Stockholders in compliance with applicable Law, which supplement shall
include a reaffirmation of the Purchaser Board Recommendation and the date,
time and place of the Special Meeting as so adjourned, (II) shall continue to
solicit proxies from the holders of Purchaser Shares to vote in favor of each
of the Proposals, and (III) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or
otherwise, Purchaser shall not otherwise cancel, recess, adjourn, postpone or
delay the Special Meeting as so adjourned or take any other action to prevent
or impede the Special Meeting as so adjourned from being convened or otherwise
prevent or impede any of the Proposals from being submitted to the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this subsection (d), Purchaser shall, at the written request of
the Company, adjourn the Special Meeting to a date to be agreed upon by
Purchaser and the Company for the absence of a quorum or if Purchaser has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Purchaser Shares to
obtain approval of the Proposals at the Special Meeting (which date, if not
mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Company, shall be the date that is
ten Business Days after the adjourned Special Meeting).

  



   

86

 



    



  

(e) Purchaser shall cause the Proxy Statement to include terms
providing Purchaser Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their
Purchaser Shares by delivering such shares for redemption to Purchaser's
transfer agent not later than 5:00 pm eastern time on the date that is two
Business Days prior to the date of the Special Meeting.

shall obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance that shall be
effective as of Closing and will cover those Persons who will be the directors

terms of the current directors' and officers' liability insurance in place
for the Company's and its Subsidiaries' directors and officers and (b) the
terms of a typical directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for a
company whose equity is listed on NYSE which policy has a scope and amount of

characteristics (including the line of business and revenues) as New Pubco,
the Company and their Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 8.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser Board, or an appropriate committee of "non-employee directors" (as
defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution

under the Exchange Act) of Purchaser following the Closing shall be an exempt

similar transaction or business combination involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or its or their business or assets (a " _Company Business
Combination Proposal_ "), in each case other than (A) with Purchaser, its
equityholders or their respective controlled Affiliates or (B) as otherwise
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement (including in connection with the

Section 8.19 _No Claim Against the Trust Account_. The Company
acknowledges that Purchaser is a blank check company with the power and
privileges to effect a merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar
business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or
assets, and the Company has read Purchaser's final prospectus, dated April 5,
2019 and other SEC Reports, the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and
the Trust Agreement and understands that Purchaser has established the Trust
Account described therein for the benefit of Purchaser's public stockholders
and that disbursements from the Trust Account are available only in the
limited circumstances set forth therein. The Company further acknowledges and
agrees that Purchaser's sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of
Purchaser's initial public offering and private placements of its
securities, and that substantially all of these proceeds have been deposited
in the Trust Account for the benefit of its public shareholders. The Company
further acknowledges that, if the Transactions are not consummated by April 8,
2021 or such later date as approved by the shareholders of Purchaser to
complete a Business Combination, Purchaser will be obligated to return to its
stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust Account. Accordingly, the
Company (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby waives any past,
present or future Action of any kind against, and any right to access, the
Trust Account, any trustee of the Trust Account and Purchaser to collect from
the Trust Account any monies that may be owed to them by Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates for any reason whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account at any time for any reason whatsoever. In the event that
the Company commences any Action against or involving the Trust Fund in
violation of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from
such party the associated reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with
any such Action, in the event Purchaser prevails in such Action. This
_Section 8.19_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Warrants, with the price per Public Warrant, the aggregate amount of warrants
subject to the Warrant Offer, and the other terms and conditions of the
Warrant Offer to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion. In the
event the Company elects to have Purchaser commence such Warrant Offer,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to launch such Warrant Offer
as soon as practicable, and such Warrant Offer shall be consummated
concurrently with the Closing with any such payment for the Public Warrants in
connection with the Warrant Offer to be made from the combined cash of the
Company and Purchaser after the release of funds from the Trust Account. The
Company shall have the right to review and approve all agreements and other
documentation relating to the Warrant Offer, and Purchaser shall not change
or waive any of the terms of the Warrant Offer without the Company's prior
written consent. Purchaser shall comply with all applicable securities laws
in its making of the Warrant Offer.

date set forth in the Extension Proposal) (the " _Outside Date_ "), if the
Closing shall not have occurred by 5:00 p.m. New York time on such date;

Representative) or a Purchaser-Side Party (in the case of a purported
termination by Purchaser), at the time of such purported termination, has
breached any of its obligations hereunder in any material respect and such
breach causes, or results in, either (i) the failure to satisfy the conditions
to the obligations of the non-terminating party set forth in _Article IX_
prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) the failure of the Closing to have
occurred prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(c)_ shall not be available to the
party seeking to terminate if a Seller-Side Party (in the case of a purported
termination by the Seller Representative) or a Purchaser-Side Party (in the

breach or breaches would result in a failure of a condition to
the obligations of the non-terminating party set forth in _Article IX_;

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(d) by Purchaser if (i) none of the Purchaser-Side Parties has
breached any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements hereunder in any material respect and (ii) a Seller-Side
Party has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements hereunder in any material respect and such breach or breaches would
render any condition set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_
not to be satisfied, and such breach is either (A) not capable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured within the earlier

to the Seller Representative and (y) two Business Days prior to the Outside
Date;

  



  

(e) by the Seller Representative if (i) none of the Seller-Side
Parties has breached any of their respective representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder in any material respect
and (ii) a Purchaser-Side Party has breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder in any
material respect and such breach or breaches would render any condition set
forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied, and
such breach is either (A) not capable of being cured prior to the Outside
Date or (B) if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x)
twenty Business Days after the giving of written notice by the Seller
Representative to Purchaser and (y) two Business Days prior to the Outside
Date; or

  



  

(f) by Purchaser if the Company shall not have provided the PCAOB

relevant provision under which termination is made shall be given to the
other party or parties, and the Transactions shall be abandoned, without
further action by any of the Seller Representative, the Company or Purchaser.

  



  

Section 10.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 10.01_, then
each of the parties shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising
under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination
shall be without liability to any party; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject
to the terms of this  _Section 10.03_, (i) no such termination shall (A)
restrict the availability of specific performance, if any, set forth in
_Section 12.13_ with respect to surviving obligations that are to be
performed following such termination or (B) relieve any party hereto from
liability for damages resulting from any Willful Breach that occurred prior to
such termination and (ii) the provisions of _Section 8.04_, _Section 8.05_,
this _Article X_, _Section 11.01 _and _Article XII_ shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The term "Willful Breach" means a party's material
breach of any of its representations or warranties as set forth in this
Agreement, or such party's material breach of any of its covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which material breach constitutes, or
is a consequence of, a purposeful act or failure to act by such party
with the knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act
would cause a material breach of this Agreement.

Section 12.09 _Company Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and
disclosures contained therein relate to and qualify certain of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations made by the Sellers
and the Company in this Agreement and shall not be construed or
otherwise deemed to constitute, any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation of the Sellers, the Company or any other Person except to the
extent explicitly provided in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand
in any way the scope or effect of any of such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other
matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission
or indication, in and of itself, that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance, that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or
that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only. No reference in the Company Disclosure Schedule
to any agreement or document, in and of itself, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such agreement or document is enforceable or
currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining to be
performed or any rights that may be exercised under such agreement or
document. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any
possible breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any agreement, law
or regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach, violation or non-compliance exists or has
actually occurred, and nothing in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
constitute an admission of any liability or obligation of any Person to any
other Person or shall confer or give any third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any other right whatsoever.
Neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described in this
Agreement or included in the Company Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections in
this Agreement and any items or matters set forth in one section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify
the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each
other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of
such items or matters to such other Section or subsection of this Agreement
is reasonably apparent. The inclusion of any cross-references to any section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or the failure to include
such cross-references, shall not be deemed to mean that the relevance of any
disclosure is not reasonably apparent for the purposes of the immediately
preceding sentence. The headings contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule
are included for convenience and reference only, and are not intended to
limit the effect of the disclosures contained in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or to expand, modify or influence the scope of the information
required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

   

103

 



    



  

(b) The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule
is confidential, proprietary information of the Sellers and the Company, and
Purchaser shall be obligated to maintain and protect such confidential
information pursuant to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. In
disclosing the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers and
the Company expressly do not waive any attorney-client privilege or other
similar privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded
by the work-product doctrine or other similar doctrine with respect to any of
the matters disclosed or discussed herein.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed and
delivered by the Seller Representative and Purchaser. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, any failure of any party to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party
entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the
party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, including by means of email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns
except as set forth in _Section 8.08_,  _Section 12.15_ and _Section
12.16_ each of which rights are hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed to
by the Purchaser-Side Parties, nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any
specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

   

104

 



    



  

Section 12.13 _Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, subject to the terms of this
_Section 12.13, _in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
Seller-Side Party, on the one hand, or any Purchaser-Side Party, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser (in the case of a breach or threatened breach by a
Seller-Side Party) and the Seller Representative (in the case of a breach or
threatened breach by a Purchaser-Side Party) shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the applicable party, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the applicable party under this Agreement,
without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond
or other security being required. The parties hereby further acknowledge and
agree that prior to the Closing, the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to
prevent or cure breaches of, this Agreement, including _Section 8.7_, by the
Seller-Side Parties or Purchaser-Side Parties, as may be applicable, and to
cause the Seller-Side Parties or Purchaser-Side Parties, as may be
applicable, to consummate the Transactions, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement. The remedies available to the parties pursuant to this
_Section 12.13 _shall be in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or
specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Seller
Representative from seeking to obtain such other remedies. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the equitable
remedies provided for in this _Section 12.13_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may
be available to a party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in the
event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
equitable remedies provided for in this _Section 12.13_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section
12.13_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any party's right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 12.13 _prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article X_ (and pursuing monetary damages)
after such termination to the extent permitted in accordance with this
Agreement), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to
this _Section 12.13 _or anything set forth in this _Section 12.13_ restrict
or limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of _Article X_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 12.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof.

  



  

   

105

 



    



  

Section 12.15 _No Recourse to Non-Parties_. Notwithstanding anything
that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits
of this Agreement, each party covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no
Persons other than the Seller-Side Parties and the Purchaser-Side Parties
shall have any liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or
unknown or whether contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that,
notwithstanding that a Seller-Side Party or a Purchaser-Side Party or its
respective managing members or general partners may be partnerships or
limited liability companies, no party has any right of recovery under this
Agreement, or any claim based on such liabilities, obligations, commitments
against, and no personal liability shall attach to, the former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Affiliates, members, managers or general or limited partners of any
party or any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
Affiliate or agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, but not including
the parties, each a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), through the Purchaser-Side
Parties or Seller-Side Parties, as may be applicable, or otherwise, whether by
or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by
or on behalf of the Company against any Non-Recourse Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise. Without limiting the
foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by any party or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns against
any Non-Recourse Party that is not otherwise expressly identified as a party
to this Agreement, and no recourse will be brought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in or breach or nonperformance of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of any party hereto set forth or
contained in this Agreement, any exhibit or schedule hereto, any other
document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of any party or any other Person delivered
hereunder.

  



  

Section 12.16 _Seller-Side Parties Representation_. Purchaser agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of each of its directors, officers, managers,
employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP may serve as counsel to the Company and its Affiliates in
connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions notwithstanding any representation by
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP prior to the Closing Date of the Company.
Purchaser and the Company hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have
that Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise
prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b) agree that, in the
event that a dispute arises either before or after the Closing between
Purchaser and the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, Simpson
Thacher and Bartlett LLP may represent the Company or any of its Affiliates in
such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly
adverse to Purchaser or the Company and even though Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP may have represented the Company in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties hereto further agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing
between or among Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and the Company, any of
the Company's Affiliates or any of the Representatives of any of the
foregoing, and any other documents, materials, reports, memoranda or other
materials, items or things that are protected under the attorney-client
privilege, the work product doctrine or any similar protection as of
immediately prior to the Closing as a result of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
LLP's representation of any of the foregoing, that relate in any way to this
Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, the " _Seller Privileged
Communications and Materials_ "), the attorney-client privilege, protection
under the work product doctrine or any similar privilege or protection and
the expectation of client confidence shall survive the Closing and remain in
effect;  _provided_ , that from and after the Closing, any such privilege,
similar protection and expectation of client confidence shall be assigned to
and controlled by the applicable Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Purchaser, the Company or any other Person other than such Seller from and
after the Closing, except to the extent expressly contemplated by the last
sentence of this _Section 12.16_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of
the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure that any
privilege or similar protection attaching as a result of Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP's representation of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall survive the Closing, remain in effect and be assigned to
and controlled by such Seller. As to any Seller Privileged Communications and
Materials, each Purchaser-Side Party, each of their respective Affiliates and,
from and after the Closing, the Company and its Affiliates, together with any
of their respective successors or assigns, agree that no such party may use or
rely on any of the Seller Privileged Communications and Materials in any
Action involving any of the parties hereto or otherwise following the Closing
except to the extent expressly contemplated by the last sentence of this
_Section 12.16_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Company and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client
privilege or similar protection to prevent disclosure of any Seller
Privileged Communications and Materials to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege or similar
protection without the prior written consent of such Seller.

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

Section 12.17 _Purchaser-Side Parties Representation_. Purchaser agrees,
on its own behalf and on behalf of each of its directors, officers, managers,
employees and Affiliates, that, following the Closing, Greenberg Traurig, LLP
may serve as counsel to Sponsor and its Affiliates in connection with any
matters related to this Agreement and the Transactions, including any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions notwithstanding any representation by Greenberg Traurig,
LLP prior to the Closing Date of Purchaser. Purchaser and the Company hereby
(a) waive any claim they have or may have that Greenberg Traurig, LLP has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises either
before or after the Closing between Sponsor, on the one hand, and Purchaser or
the Company, on the other hand, or any of their respective Affiliates,
Greenberg Traurig, LLP may represent Sponsor or any of its Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to
Purchaser or the Company and even though Greenberg Traurig, LLP may have
represented Purchaser in a matter substantially related to such dispute.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto further
agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing between or
among Greenberg Traurig, LLP and Purchaser, any of Purchaser's Affiliates or
any of the Representatives of any of the foregoing, and any other documents,
materials, reports, memoranda or other materials, items or things that are
protected under the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine or
any similar protection as of immediately prior to the Closing as a result of
Greenberg Traurig, LLP's representation of any of the foregoing, that relate
in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Privileged Communications and Materials_ "), the attorney-client
privilege, protection under the work product doctrine or any similar
privilege or protection and the expectation of client confidence shall
survive the Closing and remain in effect; _provided_ , that from and after
the Closing, any such privilege, similar protection and expectation of client
confidence shall be assigned to and controlled by Sponsor and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company or any other Person other than
Sponsor from and after the Closing, except to the extent expressly
contemplated by the last sentence of this _Section 12.17_. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees to take the steps necessary
to ensure that any privilege or similar protection attaching as a result of
Greenberg Traurig, LLP's representation of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates
or any of their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall survive the Closing, remain in effect
and be assigned to and controlled by Sponsor. As to any Purchaser Privileged
Communications and Materials, each Seller-Side Party, each of their respective
Affiliates and, from and after the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates,
together with any of their respective successors or assigns, agree that no
such party may use or rely on any of the Purchaser Privileged Communications
and Materials in any Action involving any of the parties hereto or
otherwise following the Closing except to the extent expressly contemplated
by the last sentence of this _Section 12.17_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser and a third party other
than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, Purchaser may assert the
attorney-client privilege or similar protection to prevent disclosure of any
Purchaser Privileged Communications and Materials to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may not waive such privilege or
similar protection without the prior written consent of Sponsor.

Section 12.18 _Seller Representative_.

  



  

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints BTO Urban and Family
Holdings, acting jointly, to serve (and each Purchaser-Side Party
hereby acknowledges that the Seller Representative will serve) as the
exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes
under this Agreement (including full power and authority to act on behalf of
such Seller). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing appointment,
the Seller Representative is authorized and empowered to execute any and all
instruments, certificates or other documents on behalf of each Seller, and to
do any and all other acts or things on behalf of each Seller, which the
Seller Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which may be
required pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and the performance of all obligations
hereunder or under any other Transaction Agreements from and after the date
hereof, including the exercise of the power to: (i) execute any documents on
behalf of each Seller, including any amendment to, or waiver under, this
Agreement, (ii) give and receive notices and communications to or from any
other Person relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions and other
matters contemplated hereby or by any other Transaction Agreement (except to
the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by a Seller individually), (iii)
engage and employ, on behalf of the Sellers, Representatives (including
legal counsel and other professionals) and incur such expenses as the Seller
Representative may in its sole discretion determine necessary or appropriate
in connection with the administration of the foregoing, at the expense of the
Sellers (which shall reimburse the Seller Representative for the same), (iv)
agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand arbitration or litigation of, and comply with orders
of arbitrators or courts with respect to, any dispute between any other
Person and any or all of the Sellers, in each case, relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, (v) pay or cause to be paid all expenses incurred or to
be incurred by or on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this Agreement
and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Seller Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Any action
taken by the Seller Representative will require the prior written consent of
each of BTO Urban and Family Holdings, except to the extent otherwise agreed
by BTO Urban and Family Holdings in writing. The Seller Representative shall
have the sole and exclusive authority and power to act on behalf of each
Seller with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all
claims under this Agreement and all rights or obligations arising under this
Agreement. Each Seller shall be bound by all actions taken and documents
executed by the Seller Representative in compliance with this _Section 12.18_
in connection with this Agreement, and each Purchaser-Side Party shall be
entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Seller Representative,
provided such action or decision reflects the consent of both BTO Urban and
Family Holdings. The Seller Representative shall receive no compensation
(other than the expense reimbursement contemplated above) for its services.
Notices or communications to or from the Seller Representative shall
constitute notice to or from each Seller.

  



  

   

108

 



    



  

(b) The Seller Representative will have no duties or
responsibilities except for those expressly set forth herein, and no implied
covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities on
behalf of any Seller will exist with respect to the Seller Representative in
its capacity as such. The agencies and proxies created hereunder by the
Sellers are coupled with an interest and are therefore irrevocable without
the consent of the Seller Representative, and will survive the death,
incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All
decisions and acts by the Seller Representative will be binding upon each
Seller, and no Seller will have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. The Seller Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of each Seller in accordance with the terms of this _Section 12.18_,
notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement with or among the Sellers.

  



  

(c) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, as
Seller Representative, neither BTO Urban nor Family Holdings shall be liable
to any Seller for any errors in judgment, negligence, lack of oversight,
breach of duty or otherwise. Each Seller severally (based on the
consideration such Seller actually receives (or would have received, in the
event the Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing) under this
Agreement), and not jointly, shall indemnify and hold harmless BTO Urban and
Family Holdings in their joint capacity as Seller Representative from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims and liabilities (including
attorneys' fees and other costs of defending against claims) incurred by them
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
the Seller Representative's duties hereunder. The Seller Representative is
serving in that capacity solely for purposes of administrative convenience,
and is not liable in such capacity or any other capacity for any of the
obligations of any Seller-Side Party hereunder, and each Purchaser-Side Party
agrees that it will not in any event look to the assets of BTO Urban or
Family Holdings, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by any Seller-Side Party hereunder.

Re: _Sponsor Agreement_

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

This letter (this " _Sponsor Agreement_ ") is being delivered to you in
accordance with that certain Transaction Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof, by and among Replay Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted
company (" _Purchaser_ "), Finance of America Companies Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of Purchaser (" _New Pubco_
"), Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (the " _Company_ "), and the other parties thereto (the "
_Transaction Agreement_ "), and hereby amends and restates in its entirety
that certain letter, dated April 3, 2019, from Replay Sponsor, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _Sponsor_ "), and each of the other
undersigned persons (each, an " _Insider_ " and, together with the Sponsor,
the " _Sponsor Persons_ ") to Purchaser (the " _Prior Letter Agreement_ ").
Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Paragraph 11.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings given to them in the Transaction Agreement.

  



  

The Sponsor Persons are currently, and as of the Closing will be, the record
owners of all of the outstanding Founder Shares and outstanding Private
Placement Warrants, with each such Sponsor Person's ownership (and
anticipated changes in ownership as a result of the Warrant Exchange)
detailed on _Schedule A_ hereto. As described further in Paragraph 25,
_Schedule A_ will be updated from time to time to reflect Sponsor Person
ownership changes following the date hereof.

  



  

In order to induce Purchaser, New Pubco and the Company to enter into the
Transaction Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Sponsor Person
hereby agrees, severally and not jointly, with Purchaser, New Pubco and the
Company as follows:

  



  

1. _Voting Obligations_. During the Interim Period, each Sponsor Person, in its capacity as a holder of Covered Shares, agrees irrevocably and unconditionally that, at the Special Meeting, at any other meeting of the shareholders of Purchaser or, following the Purchaser Merger, New Pubco (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting, however called and including any adjournment or postponement thereof), in connection with any written consent of shareholders of Purchaser or, following the Purchaser Merger, New Pubco and in connection with any similar vote or consent of the holders of Private Placement Warrants in their capacities as such, such Sponsor Person shall, and shall cause any other holder of record of any of such Sponsor Person's Covered Shares to:

  



  

   



 



    



  

(a) when such meeting is held, appear at such meeting or otherwise
cause the Sponsor Person's Covered Shares to be counted as present thereat
for the purpose of establishing a quorum;

  



  

(b) vote (or duly and promptly execute and deliver an action by
written consent), or cause to be voted at such meeting (or cause such
consent to be duly and promptly executed and delivered with respect to), all
of such Sponsor Person's Covered Shares owned as of the record date for
determining holders entitled to vote at such meeting (or the record date for
determining holders entitled to provide consent) in favor of each Proposal
and any other matters reasonably necessary for consummation of the
Transactions (including the Warrant Exchange, to the extent it is put to a
vote or a request for written consent); and

  



  

(c) vote (or duly and promptly execute and deliver an action by
written consent), or cause to be voted at such meeting (or cause such
consent to be duly and promptly executed and delivered with respect to), all
of such Sponsor Person's Covered Shares against any Business Combination
Proposal (as defined below) and any other action that would reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with or materially delay or postpone the
consummation of, or otherwise adversely affect, any of the Transactions or
result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other obligation or agreement of any Purchaser-Side Party under the
Transaction Agreement or result in a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other obligation or agreement of such Sponsor Person
under this Sponsor Agreement.

  



  

The obligations of the Sponsor Persons in this Paragraph 1 shall apply
whether or not the board of directors of Purchaser (or, following the
Purchaser Merger, New Pubco) or other governing body or any committee,
subcommittee or subgroup thereof recommends any of the Proposals and whether
or not such board or other governing body, committee, subcommittee or
subgroup thereof changes, withdraws, withholds, qualifies or modifies, or
publicly proposes to change, withdraw, withhold, qualify or modify, the
Purchaser Board Recommendation.

  



  

2. _Exclusivity_. During the Interim Period, each Sponsor Person shall not take, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives to take, whether directly or indirectly, any action to (i) solicit, initiate, continue or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or encourage, respond to, provide information to or commence due diligence with respect to, any Person (other than the Company, its equityholders or any of their controlled Affiliates or Representatives), concerning, relating to or which is intended or could reasonably be likely to give rise to or result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or oral, relating to any Business Combination (a " _Business Combination Proposal_ "), or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or make any public statement approving, endorsing or recommending, any Business Combination Proposal, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), other than a Business Combination Proposal with the Company, its equityholders or their respective controlled Affiliates. Each Sponsor Person shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which are reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, a Business Combination Proposal other than with the Company, its equityholders or their respective controlled Affiliates.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

3. _Waiver of Certain Rights_. Each Sponsor Person, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees:

  



  

(a) not to (i) demand that Purchaser redeem its Covered Shares in
connection with the Transactions or (ii) otherwise participate in any such
redemption by tendering or submitting any of its Covered Shares for
redemption;

  



  

(b) not to commence or participate in, and to take all actions
necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any
claim, derivative or otherwise, against Purchaser, New Pubco, the Company, any
Affiliate or designee of a Sponsor Person acting in its capacity as director,
officer or manager or in any similar capacity or any of their respective
successors and assigns relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of
this Sponsor Agreement, the Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions; and

  



  

(c) (i) to waive any rights for working capital loans made by or
on its behalf to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be converted
into warrants exercisable for Purchaser Shares, New Pubco Shares or other
securities of Purchaser, New Pubco or any of their Affiliates or their
successors and assigns and (ii) that no such loans shall be converted into
such warrants or any such other securities.

  



  

4. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Undertakings_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, each Sponsor Person (i) shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement and (ii)
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the satisfaction of any
of the conditions to the Transactions set forth in _Article IX_ of the
Transaction Agreement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of subsection (a) above, each
Sponsor Person shall provide, or cause to be provided, all
agreements, documents, instruments, affidavits, statements or information
that may be required or requested by any Governmental Entity relating to (i)
such Sponsor Person and its Affiliates (including any of its, or its
Affiliates', directors, officers, employees, partners, members or
shareholders), (ii) all Persons who are deemed or may be deemed to "control"
such Sponsor Person and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of applicable
Mortgage Laws and (iii) such Sponsor Person's and its Affiliates' structure,
ownership, businesses, operations, regulatory and legal compliance, assets,
liabilities, financing, financial condition or results of operations, or any
of its or their directors, officers, employees, partners, members or
shareholders.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

5. _Warrant Exchange_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Redomestication, each Sponsor Person
that holds Private Placement Warrants as of the date hereof shall exchange
the Private Placement Warrants held by it for Purchaser Shares in the manner
described in this Paragraph 5 (as to all Private Placement Warrants that are
so exchanged, the " _Warrant Exchange_ ").

  



  

(b) Purchaser hereby represents and warrants that all of the
Private Placement Warrants are held in book-entry form and that the transfer
books for the Private Placement Warrants are maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Warrant Agent_ "). During the Interim
Period, Purchaser and New Pubco shall not, and shall cause the Warrant Agent
not to, allow the Transfer of any Private Placement Warrants or allow any of
the Private Placement Warrants to be represented by a certificate or other
instrument. Further, no Sponsor Person shall request the Transfer of any
Private Placement Warrant or request for any of the Private Placement
Warrants to be represented by a certificate or other instrument.

  



  

(c) Immediately prior to the Redomestication, Purchaser shall
exchange all of the Private Placement Warrants for an aggregate of 775,000
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Purchaser Shares, in each case,
as allocated on _Schedule A_. Purchaser shall effect the Warrant Exchange by
issuing the applicable number of Purchaser Shares to each applicable Sponsor
Person in accordance with  _Schedule A_. Following the Warrant Exchange, the
Private Placement Warrants shall be void and of no further effect, and no
Private Placement Warrants shall be outstanding.

  



  

(d) Purchaser and each applicable Sponsor Person agrees to
cooperate with each other and their respective officers, employees, attorneys,
accountants and other agents, and, generally, do such other reasonable acts
and things in good faith as may be necessary to effectuate the intents and
purposes of the Warrant Exchange, subject to the terms and conditions hereof
and compliance with applicable Law, including taking reasonable action to
facilitate the filing of any document or the taking of reasonable action to
assist the other parties hereto in complying with the terms hereof.

  



  

6. _Transfer Restrictions_.

  



  

(a) _Interim Period_. During the Interim Period, except as
expressly contemplated by the Warrant Exchange, each Sponsor Person shall
not, and shall cause any other holder of record of any of such Sponsor
Person's Covered Shares not to, Transfer any of such Sponsor Person's Covered
Shares.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(b) _Post-Closing: Covered Shares_. During the one-year period
immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), each
Sponsor Person shall not, and shall cause any other holder of record of any of
such Sponsor Person's Covered Shares (other than Excluded Shares) not to,
Transfer any of such Sponsor Person's Covered Shares (other than Excluded
Shares). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, post-Closing
Transfers of Covered Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that are held by any
Sponsor Person or any of its Permitted Transferees (as defined below) that
have entered into a written agreement contemplated by the proviso in this
subsection (b) are permitted (i) to New Pubco's officers or directors,
any Affiliates or family members of any of New Pubco's officers or directors,
any members of the Sponsor or any Affiliates of the Sponsor; (ii) in the case
of an individual, by gift to a member of the individual's immediate family, or
to a trust, the beneficiary of which is a member of the individual's
immediate family or an Affiliate of such person, or to a
charitable organization; (iii) in the case of an individual, by virtue of
laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual; (iv) in the
case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (v)
by virtue of the Laws of the State of Delaware or the Sponsor's limited
liability company agreement, as amended from time to time, upon dissolution
of the Sponsor; or (vi) in the event of New Pubco's completion of a
liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization or other
similar transaction which results in the holders of all of the shares of New
Pubco Class A Common Stock and New Pubco Class B Common Stock having the
right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other
property subsequent to the completion of Purchaser's initial Business
Combination (including the entry into an agreement in connection with such
liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization or other
similar transaction); _provided_ , _however_ , that each transferee
contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) (each, a " _Permitted Transferee_ ")
must enter into a written agreement with New Pubco agreeing to be bound by
the restrictions in this Sponsor Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Post-Closing: Excluded Shares_. During the 180-day period
immediately following the Closing Date, each Sponsor Person shall not, and
shall cause any other holder of record of any of such Sponsor Person's
Excluded Shares (other than Excluded Shares purchased (i) pursuant to a PIPE
Agreement or (ii) on the open market after the date hereof) not to, Transfer
any of such Sponsor Person's Excluded Shares (other than Excluded Shares
purchased (i) pursuant to a PIPE Agreement or (ii) on the open market
after the date hereof). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
post-Closing Transfers of Excluded Shares (other than Excluded Shares
purchased (i) pursuant to a PIPE Agreement or (ii) on the open market after
the date hereof) that are held by any Sponsor Person or any of its Permitted
Transferees that have entered into a written agreement contemplated by the
proviso in this subsection (c) are permitted to its Permitted Transferees;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each Permitted Transferee must enter into a
written agreement with New Pubco agreeing to be bound by the restrictions in
this Sponsor Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Excluded Shares
purchased (1) pursuant to a PIPE Agreement or (2) on the open market after
the date hereof shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 6(c).

  



  

(d) Any Transfer in violation of the provisions of this Paragraph
6 shall be null and void _ab initio_ and of no force or effect.

  



  

7. _Vesting Provisions Applicable to Founder Shares_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Each Sponsor Person agrees that, as of immediately
prior to the Purchaser Merger, all of the Founder Shares held by such
Sponsor Person shall be unvested and, from and after the Purchaser Merger,
shall be subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions set forth in this
Paragraph 7. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Shares received in the
Warrant Exchange shall be vested immediately upon the Warrant Exchange and
shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 7.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(b) _Special Transfer Restrictions for Unvested Founder Shares_.
Each Sponsor Person shall not, and shall cause any other holder of record of
any of such Sponsor Person's unvested Founder Shares not to, Transfer any of
such Sponsor Person's unvested Founder Shares prior to the time such unvested
Founder Shares become vested pursuant to subsection (d) below, except to the
extent permitted by the second sentence of Paragraph 6(b). Each Sponsor
Person understands that the Transfer restrictions in the
immediately preceding sentence are in addition to, and not in lieu of, those
imposed under the first sentence of Paragraph 6(b).

  



  

(c) _Vesting of Founder Shares Upon Purchaser Merger_. 40% of the
unvested Founder Shares Beneficially Owned by each Sponsor Person
(or Affiliate thereof) as of immediately prior to the Purchaser Merger shall
vest upon the Purchaser Merger.

  



  

(d) _Performance Vesting of Founder Shares_.

  



  

(i) If, at any time during the six (6) years following the
Closing, the VWAP of New Pubco Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal
to $12.50 for any twenty (20) Trading Days within a period of thirty (30)
consecutive Trading Days (the date when the foregoing is first satisfied, the
" _First Earnout Achievement Date_ "), 35% of the unvested Founder Shares
Beneficially Owned by each Sponsor Person (or Affiliate thereof) as of
immediately prior to the Purchaser Merger shall vest. If the First
Earnout Achievement Date or a New Pubco Sale has not occurred after the
Closing and prior to the date that is six (6) years following the Closing
Date, the Founder Shares that were eligible to vest pursuant to this clause
(i) shall not vest and shall be forfeited as provided in subsection (e)
below.

  



  

(ii) If, at any time during the six (6) years following the
Closing, the VWAP of New Pubco Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal
to $15.00 for any twenty (20) Trading Days within a period of thirty (30)
consecutive Trading Days (the date when the foregoing is first satisfied, the
" _Second Earnout Achievement Date_ "), 25% of the unvested Founder Shares
Beneficially Owned by each Sponsor Person (or Affiliate thereof) as of
immediately prior to the Purchaser Merger shall vest. If the Second Earnout
Achievement Date or a New Pubco Sale has not occurred after the Closing and
prior to the date that is six (6) years following the Closing Date, the
Founder Shares that were eligible to vest pursuant to this clause (ii) shall
not vest and shall be forfeited as provided in subsection (e) below.

  



  

(iii) In the event that there is an agreement with respect to a
New Pubco Sale entered into after the Closing and prior to the date that is
six (6) years following the Closing Date:

  



   | (A)| to the extent it has not already occurred, the First Earnout 
Achievement Date shall be deemed to occur on the day prior to the closing of
such New  Pubco Sale if the price paid per New Pubco Share in such New Pubco
Sale is greater than  or equal to $12.50, and the Founder Shares eligible for
vesting pursuant to clause (i) above  shall vest; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (B)| to the extent it has not already occurred, the Second Earnout 
Achievement Date shall also be deemed to occur on the day prior to the closing
of such  New Pubco Sale if the price paid per New Pubco Share in such New
Pubco Sale is greater  than or equal to $15.00, and the Founder Shares
eligible for vesting pursuant to clause  (ii) above shall vest; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

6

 



    



   | (C)| in the event (x) the price paid per New Pubco Share in  such New
Pubco Sale is greater than or equal to $10.00 (to the extent the Second
Earnout  Achievement Date has not occurred) but does not exceed $12.50 and
(y) the consideration  paid per New Pubco Share in such New Pubco Sale
includes stock or other equity consideration,  as a condition to the
consummation of such New Pubco Sale, the acquiror in such New Pubco  Sale
shall agree that the unvested Founder Shares eligible for vesting pursuant to
clause  (i) above shall remain eligible for vesting following the closing of
such New Pubco  Sale, and the stock price thresholds set forth in clause (i)
above shall be equitably  adjusted for the conversion ratio and other terms
and conditions of the transaction,  as determined by the board of directors
of New Pubco in good faith (but the Founder Shares  eligible for vesting
pursuant to clause (ii) above will no longer be eligible for  vesting
following such closing and will be forfeited pursuant to subsection (e)
below);  and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (D)| in the event the price paid per New Pubco Share in such New 
Pubco Sale is (x) less than $10.00 or (y) less than $12.50 and payable
solely  in cash consideration, the unvested Founder Shares eligible for
vesting pursuant to clauses  (i) and (ii) above will no longer be eligible
for vesting following the closing  of such New Pubco Sale and will be
forfeited pursuant to subsection (e) below); 
---|---|--- 
  



  

 _provided_ , that (I) in each of the foregoing clauses (A) through (D), to
the extent the price paid per New Pubco Share includes contingent
consideration or property other than cash, the board of directors of New
Pubco shall determine the price paid per New Pubco Share in such New Pubco
Sale in good faith (valuing any such consideration payable in publicly-traded
securities of the acquiror, on a per-security basis, at the VWAP of such
security over the twenty (20) consecutive Trading Day period ending on (and
including) the second Business Day prior to the date of the entry into the
binding definitive agreement providing for the consummation of such New Pubco
Sale) and (II) any determination by the board of directors of New Pubco with
respect to any matters contemplated by, or related to, this Paragraph 7,
including the price paid per New Pubco Share in any New Pubco Sale, the
determination of whether any Founder Shares are eligible for vesting under
this Paragraph 7 or the form or requirement of any agreement by an acquirer
under clause (C) above, shall be made in good faith and shall be final and
binding on the Sponsor Persons and each of their respective Affiliates.

  



  

(e) _Forfeiture of Unvested Founder Shares_. Unvested Founder
Shares that are forfeited under this Paragraph 7 shall be transferred by
the forfeiting Sponsor Person (or Affiliate thereof) that Beneficially Owns
such Founder Shares to New Pubco (x) on the day immediately following the
sixth anniversary of the Closing or (y) on the day immediately prior to the
closing of any New Pubco Sale, as applicable, in each case, without any
consideration for such Transfer, and New Pubco shall be entitled to cancel
such unvested Founder Shares without any further action or consent of such
forfeiting Sponsor Person (or Affiliate thereof).

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(f) _Proportional Voting of Unvested Founder Shares_.

  



  

(i) Each Sponsor Person hereby agrees that, with respect to all of
the unvested Founder Shares Beneficially Owned by such Sponsor Person (or
Affiliate thereof), such Founder Shares shall be present at all meetings for
purposes of a quorum and voted at all meetings of the stockholders of New
Pubco, or voted, consented or approved in any other circumstances, upon which
such vote, consent or other approval (including providing any written consent
as of any specified date) is sought or obtained by or from the
stockholders of New Pubco, in the same manner (including by voting "for" or
"against," abstaining or withholding votes) as, and in the same proportion
to, the votes cast "for" or "against," and abstentions or vote
withholdings made, in respect of all shares of New Pubco Class A Common Stock
and New Pubco Class B Common Stock, taken together, held by the holders
thereof (other than the unvested Founder Shares held by the Sponsor Persons
(of Affiliates thereof)).

  



  

(ii) In order to give effect to the proportional voting mechanics
described in clause (i) above, solely to the extent of its unvested Founder
Shares, each Sponsor Person hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints
each officer of New Pubco, with full power of substitution and re-
substitution, its true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact, for it and in
its name, place and stead and for its use and benefit, to act as its proxy
and attorney-in-fact to attend any meeting of stockholders of New Pubco with
respect to any such unvested Founder Shares, vote any such unvested Founder
Shares at any such meeting of stockholders of New Pubco, execute and deliver
any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders of New
Pubco with respect to such unvested Founder Shares and take any other action
with respect to such unvested Founder Shares in respect of any other approval
of the stockholders of New Pubco. The proxy and power of attorney granted
pursuant to this clause (ii) is a special proxy coupled with an interest and
is irrevocable and shall remain in effect until the termination of this
Sponsor Agreement in accordance with Paragraph 19.

  



  

(g) _No Economic Rights of Unvested Founder Shares_. Unvested
Founder Shares shall not be entitled to, and each holder of any
unvested Founder Shares (in its capacity as such) hereby irrevocably waives
any right to, receive any dividends or other distributions (whether payable
in the form of cash, stock or other assets), or to have any other economic
rights (including, without limitation, the right to receive any consideration
payable upon conversion or exchange), for so long as such Unvested Founder
Shares remain unvested. No adjustments shall be made for dividends or
distributions or other rights in respect of unvested Founder Shares for which
any record date occurs prior to the date upon which such Founder Shares become
vested ( _i.e._ , unvested Founder Shares will not be entitled to receive
back dividends or other distributions or any other form of economic "catch-up"
once they become vested).

  



  

(h) _No Application to Certain Sponsor Persons_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Sponsor Agreement, this Paragraph
7 shall not apply to any of the Founder Shares held by Daniel Marx, Mariano
Bosch or Russell Colaco as of the Closing, which such Founder Shares shall be
100% vested from and after the Closing; _provided_ , that any such Founder
Shares that are Transferred to any other Sponsor Person (or any Permitted
Transferee thereof) following the Closing shall be subject to this Paragraph

Promptly following each such notification, Purchaser or New Pubco (as applicable) shall update _Schedule A_ to reflect the applicable changes as they relate to Founder Shares or Private Placement Warrants (in the case of an Interim Period change) or Founder Shares (in the case of a post-Closing change) and provide a copy of such updated _Schedule A_ to each of the parties hereto, and such updated _Schedule A_ shall control for all purposes of this Sponsor Agreement (unless and until it is later updated in accordance with this Paragraph 25). Any update to _Schedule A_ in accordance with this Sponsor Agreement shall not be deemed an amendment to this Sponsor Agreement for purposes of Paragraph 12.

Purchaser and the Company that (i) on or prior to the date hereof, it has
delivered to New Pubco, Purchaser and the Company a capitalization table
showing all of the direct equity owners of the Sponsor (the " _Sponsor Cap
Table_ "), (ii) the Sponsor Cap Table is true, correct and complete in all
respects as of the date hereof and (iii) as of the date hereof, no person who
is contemplated to be a director, board observer or officer of New Pubco
following the Closing holds a direct or indirect economic interest in the
Sponsor.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, following the
date hereof, the Sponsor shall provide written notice to New Pubco, Purchaser
and the Company promptly following (i) any change in the Sponsor Cap Table or
(ii) any director, board observer or officer of New Pubco (or, if in the pre-
Closing period, any person who is contemplated to be a director, board
observer or officer of New Pubco following the Closing) becoming a direct or
indirect holder of an economic interest in the Sponsor.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (including
Paragraphs 6(b) and 6(c)), if any director, board observer or officer of New

interests in any or all of the shares of Common Stock or LLC Units held by it
including to banks or financial institutions as collateral or security for
loans, advances or extensions of credit or (y) transfer any or all of the
shares of Common Stock or LLC Units held by it, including to a third party
investor, the Company agrees to cooperate with such Principal Stockholder in
taking any action reasonably necessary to consummate any such pledge,
hypothecation, grant or transfer, including without limitation, delivery of
letter agreements to lenders in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to

more entities (each, a "NewCo"), whether existing or newly formed, including
without limitation by way of spin-off, split-off, carve-out, demerger,
recapitalization, reorganization or similar transaction, and any Principal
Stockholder will receive equity interests in any such NewCo as part of such
separation, the Company shall cause any such NewCo to enter into a
Stockholders agreement with the Principal Stockholders that provides the
Principal Stockholders with rights vis-a-vis such NewCo that are
substantially identical to those set forth in this Agreement.

Principal Stockholder shall not, and shall cause any other holder of record of
any of such Principal Stockholder's Covered Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) not to, Transfer any of such Principal Stockholder's Covered Shares
(other than Excluded Shares). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, post-Closing Transfers of Covered Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) that are held by any Principal Stockholder or any of its
Permitted Transferees (as defined below) that have entered into a written
agreement contemplated by the proviso in this _Section 4.3 _are permitted (i)
to any investment fund or other entity controlled or managed by such
Principal Stockholder, to such Principal Stockholder's officers or

Stockholder's officers or directors, any limited partners, members or
stockholders of such Principal Stockholder or any Affiliates of the Principal
Stockholders; (ii) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of the

Class A Common Stock and/or LLC Units having the right to exchange their
shares for cash, securities or other property subsequent to the completion of
the Equity Transactions (including the entry into an agreement in connection
with such liquidation, merger, amalgamation, share exchange, reorganization

contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) (each, a " _Permitted Transferee_ ")
must enter into a written agreement with the Company agreeing to be bound by
the restrictions in this _Section 4.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Excluded Shares purchased (1) pursuant to a PIPE Agreement or (2) on the open
market shall not be subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.3_. Any
Transfer in violation of the provisions of this _Section 4.3 _shall be null

this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, right, remedy, power or

 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

  



  

Section 2.1 _Right to Demand a Non-Shelf Registered Offering_.
Upon the demand of any Principal Stockholder, the Registrant will, in each
case, subject to _Section 2.12_, facilitate in the manner described in this
Agreement a non-shelf registered offering of the Registrable Securities
requested by such Principal Stockholder to be included in such offering. Any
demanded non-shelf registered offering may, at the Registrant's option,
include Common Stock of the Registrant to be sold by the Registrant for its
own account and will also include Registrable Securities to be sold by
Holders that exercise their related piggyback rights in accordance with this
Agreement. Promptly upon receiving any demand (but in no event, more than 90
days after receipt of a demand for such registration), the Registrant shall
use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement relating to
such demand. The Registrant shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such registration to promptly be declared effective under (x) the Securities
Act and (y) the blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any participating
Holder or any underwriter, if any, reasonably requests.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Right to Piggyback on a Non-Shelf Registered
Offering_. In connection with any registered offering of Registrable
Securities covered by a non-shelf registration statement (whether pursuant to
the exercise of demand rights by a Principal Stockholder or at the initiative
of the Registrant or holders not party to this Agreement), any non-demanding
Holder may exercise piggyback rights to have included in such offering
Registrable Securities held by it. The Registrant will facilitate in the
manner described in this Agreement any such non-shelf registered offering.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Right to Demand and be Included in a Shelf
Registration_. Upon the demand of a Principal Stockholder, subject to _Section
2.12_, when the Registrant is eligible to sell its Common Stock in a
secondary offering on a delayed or continuous basis in accordance with Rule
415 of the Securities Act whether on Form S-1, Form S-3 or a successor form,
the Registrant will facilitate in the manner described in this Agreement a
shelf registration of the Registrable Securities requested by such Principal
Stockholder to be included in such shelf registration. Promptly upon
receiving any demand (but in no event more than 45 days in the case of a
shelf registration on Form S-1 or 30 days in the case of a shelf registration
on Form S-3 after receipt of a demand for such registration), the Registrant
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file a registration statement
relating to such demand. The Registrant, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such registration to promptly be declared effective
under (x) the Securities Act and (y) the blue sky laws of such jurisdictions
as any participating Holder or any underwriter, if any, reasonably requests.
Any shelf registration filed by the Registrant covering Common Stock (whether
pursuant to a Principal Stockholder's demand or the initiative of the
Registrant) will cover Registrable Securities held by each of the Holders as
may be specified by the Principal Stockholders, and solely to the extent
permitted by this Agreement. If at the time of such request the Registrant is
a WKSI, such shelf registration would, at the request of a Principal
Stockholder, cover an unspecified number of Registrable Securities to be sold
by the Registrant and the Holders.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Demand and Piggyback Rights for Shelf Takedowns_.
Upon the demand of a Principal Stockholder (the " _Demand Party_ "), the
Registrant will, in each case, facilitate in the manner described in this
Agreement a "takedown" off of an effective shelf registration statement of
the Registrable Securities requested by the Demand Party to be included in
such takedown. In connection with the exercise by the Demand Party of a
demand right pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, the Demand Party shall
also deliver the applicable demand request to (i) each Principal Stockholder
other than the Demand Party, and, subject to the limitations in _Section
2.12_, the Demand Party shall permit each other Principal Stockholder to
include all or a portion of its Registrable Securities in the "takedown" if
such Principal Stockholder notifies the Demand Party and the Company within
one day after delivery of the demand request to such Principal Stockholder of
its election to participate (which election shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Principal
Stockholder) and (ii) where the contemplated plan of distribution includes a
customary "road show" or other substantial marketing effort by the Registrant
and the underwriters (a " _Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering_ "), any Other
Holders of Registrable Securities included on the applicable shelf
registration statement and, subject to the limitations in _Section
2.12_, the Demand Party shall permit each such Other Holder to include all or
a portion of its Registrable Securities in the Marketed Underwritten Shelf
Offering if such Other Holder notifies the Demand Party and the Company within
one day after delivery of the demand request to such Other Holder of its
election to participate (which election shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Other Holder). For
the avoidance of doubt, any proposed offer and sale of Registrable
Securities to one or more purchasers or underwriters by means of a block
trade, bought deal or direct sale shall not be deemed to be a
Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Principal Stockholder may not demand a shelf takedown for an offering that
will result in the imposition of a lockup on the Registrant and the Holders
unless the Registrable Securities requested to be sold in such takedown have
an aggregate market value (based on the most recent closing price of the
Shares at the time of the demand) of at least $50 million.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

Section 2.5 _Right to Reload a Shelf_. Upon the written request
of a Principal Stockholder, the Registrant will, in each case, file and seek
the effectiveness of a post-effective amendment to an existing shelf in order
to register up to the number of Registrable Securities previously taken down
off of such shelf and not yet "reloaded" onto such shelf (or such higher
number as may be agreed by such Principal Stockholder). The Holders and the
Registrant will consult and coordinate with each other in order to
accomplish such replenishments from time to time in a sensible manner.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Effective Registration_. The Registrant shall, with
respect to each demand registration, use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the registration statement to remain effective for not less than 180
consecutive days (or such shorter period as shall terminate when all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been sold
or withdrawn), or if (i) such registration is a shelf registration on Form
S-1 until such shelf registration is amended or replaced by a shelf
registration on Form S-3 (or such shorter period as shall terminate when all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement have been
sold or withdrawn) or (ii) such registration statement relates to an
underwritten offering, such longer period as, in the opinion of counsel for
the underwriter or underwriters, a prospectus is required by law to be
delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Securities by an
underwriter or dealer.

  



  

Section 2.7 _Limitations on Demand and Piggyback Rights_.

  



  

(a) Any demand for the filing of a registration statement or for a
registered offering or takedown will be subject to the constraints of any
applicable lockup arrangements, and such demand must be deferred until such
lockup arrangements no longer apply. No Principal Stockholder shall be
subject to such lockup arrangements to the extent such Principal Stockholder
holds less than 5% of the then outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant (on
a fully exchanged basis assuming all outstanding LLC Units other than those
held by the Registrant or its wholly owned subsidiaries were exchanged for
Shares). If a demand has been made for a non-shelf registered offering or for
an underwritten takedown, no further demands may be made so long as the
related offering is still being pursued; provided, that any such offering
will not be deemed to be "pursued" if such offering has not been consummated
within 45 days of the date on which the registration statement with respect
to such offering was declared effective. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Holders will not have piggyback or other
registration rights with respect to (i) registered primary offerings by the
Registrant (A) covered by a Form S-8 registration statement or a successor
form applicable solely to employee benefit-related offers and sales, (B)
where the securities are not being sold for cash or (C) where the offering is
a bona fide offering of securities other than Common Stock, even if such
securities are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common
Stock that are registered as part of such offering; or (ii) any registration
statement filed pursuant to the terms of the PIPE Subscription Agreements.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(b) The Registrant may postpone the filing (but not the preparation)
of a demanded registration statement or suspend the effectiveness of any
shelf registration statement for a reasonable "blackout period" not in excess
of 60 days if the Board of the Registrant reasonably determines in good faith
that such registration or offering could materially interfere with a bona fide
business or financing transaction of the Registrant (a " _Valid Business
Reason_ ") or is reasonably likely to require premature disclosure of
information, the premature disclosure of which could materially and adversely
affect the Registrant. The blackout period will end upon the earlier to occur
of, (i) in the case of a Valid Business Reason, a date that is five Business
Days after such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no event, not
later than 60 days from the date such deferral commenced, and (ii) in the
case of disclosure of non-public information, the earlier to occur of (x) the
filing by the Registrant of its next succeeding Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
(y) the date upon which such information is otherwise
disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrant shall not be
permitted to suspend or withdraw a registration statement more than once
during any twelve (12)-month period or for a period exceeding 60 days on any
one occasion. In the case of an event that causes the Registrant to delay the
filing of a demanded registration statement or to suspend the use of the
effectiveness of a shelf registration statement, the Registrant shall give a
notice to the demanding Holder or the holders of Registrable Securities
registered pursuant to such shelf registration statement, as applicable,
stating generally the basis for the notice and that such delay or
suspension. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the
Registrant provides a notice with respect to the delay in filing a demanded
registration statement or the suspension of the effectiveness of a shelf
registration statement, the Registrant agrees that it shall extend the period
of time during which any such registration statement shall be maintained
effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of days during which such
delay or suspension was continuing.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Notifications Regarding Registration Statements_. In
order for a Principal Stockholder to exercise its right to demand that a
registration statement be filed, it must so notify the Registrant in writing
indicating the number of Registrable Securities sought to be registered and
the proposed plan of distribution. The Registrant will keep the Holders
contemporaneously apprised of any registration or shelf takedown of
Registrable Securities, with respect to which a piggyback right provided under
this Agreement is available in order that they may have a reasonable
opportunity to exercise their related piggyback rights. Without limiting the
Registrant's obligation as described in the preceding sentence, having a
reasonable opportunity requires that the Holders be notified by
the Registrant of an anticipated filing of a registration statement (whether
pursuant to a demand made by a Principal Stockholder or at the Registrant's
own initiative or at the initiative of other holders not party to this
Agreement) no later than 5:00 pm, New York City time, on the date that is two
Business Days prior to the date on which the registration statement is
intended to be filed. Each Principal Stockholder and the Registrant agrees to
use its good faith efforts to provide advance notice as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Principal Stockholders of such first Principal
Stockholder's or the Registrant's intention to file or cause the filing of a
registration statement; provided, however, that none of the Principal
Stockholders or the Registrant shall be obligated hereby to provide any such
advance notice and, if provided, such advance notice shall not be binding in
any respect.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(a) Subject to any required public disclosure and applicable legal
requirements, the parties will maintain the confidentiality of these
discussions.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Notifications Regarding Registration Piggyback
Rights_. Any Holder wishing to exercise its piggyback rights with respect to a
non-shelf registration statement must notify the Registrant and the other
Holders of the number of Registrable Securities it seeks to have included
in such registration statement. Such notice must be given as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than 5:00 pm, New York City time, on the
second trading day prior to (i) if applicable, the date on which the
preliminary prospectus intended to be used in connection with pre-effective
marketing efforts for the relevant offering is expected to be finalized, and
(ii) in any case, the date on which the pricing of the relevant offering is
expected to occur. No such notice is required in connection with a shelf
registration statement, as Registrable Securities held by all Holders will be
included subject to the limitations described in _Section 2.3_.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Notifications Regarding Demanded Underwritten
Takedowns_.

  



  

(a) In order for a Principal Stockholder to exercise its right to
demand an underwritten takedown of Registrable Securities off a
shelf registration statement, it must so notify the Registrant in writing
indicating the number of Registrable Securities sought to be registered and
the proposed plan of distribution. The Registrant will keep the Holders
contemporaneously apprised of all pertinent aspects of any underwritten shelf
takedown with respect to which a piggyback right is provided under this
Agreement (and in the case of Other Holders excluding, for clarity, any such
shelf takedown that is not a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering) in
order that they may have a reasonable opportunity to exercise their related
piggyback rights. In the case of a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering,
without limiting the Registrant's obligation as described in the preceding
sentence, having a reasonable opportunity requires that the Holders be
notified by the Registrant the date that is two Business Days prior to the
date on which the preliminary prospectus or prospectus supplement is intended
to be used in connection with such offering. Each Principal Stockholder and
the Registrant agrees to use its good faith efforts to provide advance notice
as soon as reasonably practicable to the Principal Stockholders of such first
Principal Stockholder's or the Registrant's intention to deliver a takedown
notice; provided, however, that none of the Principal Stockholders or the
Registrant shall be obligated hereby to provide any such advance notice and,
if provided, such advance notice shall not be binding in any respect.

  



  

(b) Any Holder wishing to exercise its piggyback rights with respect
to an Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering must notify the Registrant and the
other Holders of the number of Registrable Securities it seeks to have
included in such takedown. Such notice must be given as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than 5:00 pm, New York City time, on (i) if applicable,
the trading day prior to the date on which the preliminary prospectus or
prospectus supplement intended to be used in connection with marketing
efforts for the relevant offering is expected to be finalized, and (ii) in
all cases, the trading day prior to the date on which the pricing of the
relevant takedown occurs.

  



  

(c) Subject to any required public disclosure and applicable legal
requirements, the parties will maintain appropriate confidentiality of
their discussions regarding a prospective underwritten takedown.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

Section 2.11 _Plan of Distribution, Underwriters and Counsel_. If a
majority of the Shares proposed to be sold in an underwritten offering
through a non-shelf registration statement or through a shelf takedown is
being sold by the Registrant for its own account (for clarity, excluding
Shares to be sold by the Registrant for its own account to the extent the
proceeds from such sale will be used to purchase LLC Units from Holders), the
Registrant will be entitled to determine the plan of distribution and select
the managing underwriters for such offering. Otherwise, Holders holding a
majority of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
offering will be entitled to determine the plan of distribution and select
the managing underwriters, and such majority will also be entitled to select
counsel for the selling Holders (which may be the same as counsel for the
Registrant). In the case of a shelf registration statement, the plan of
distribution will provide as much flexibility as is reasonably possible,
including with respect or resales by transferee Holders.

  



  

Section 2.12 _Cutbacks_. If the managing underwriters advise the
Registrant and the selling Holders that, in their reasonable opinion, the
number of Shares requested to be included in an underwritten offering exceeds
the amount that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
distribution of the Shares being offered, such offering will include only the
number of Shares that the underwriters advise can be sold in such offering
without such adverse effect. If the Registrant is selling Shares for its own
account in such offering (for clarity, excluding Shares to be sold by the
Registrant for its own account to the extent the proceeds from such sale
will be used to purchase LLC Units from Holders), and the offering is not
being made on account of a demand by a Principal Stockholder, the Registrant
will have first priority and to the extent of any remaining capacity, unless
otherwise determined by each Principal Stockholder who requested to sell
Registrable Securities in such offering, the selling Holders will be subject
to cutback pro rata based on the number of Registrable Securities initially
requested by them to be included in such offering, without
distinguishing between Holders based on who made the demand for such offering
or who is exercising piggyback rights. In all other cases, the Holders will
have first priority, and unless otherwise determined by each Principal
Stockholder who requested to sell Registrable Securities in such offering,
the selling Holders will be subject to cutback pro rata based on the number of
Registrable Securities initially requested by them to be included in such
offering, without distinguishing between Holders based on who made the
demand for such offering or who is exercising piggyback rights.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Lockups_. In connection with any underwritten
offering of Registrable Securities, the Registrant and each Holder will agree
(in the case of Holders, with respect to Registrable Securities respectively
held by them) to be bound by the underwriting agreement's lockup restrictions
(which must apply in like manner to all of them) that are agreed to by Holders
holding a majority of Registrable Securities being sold by all Holders. If
required by the Principal Stockholders, each Holder in the case of an
underwritten public offering shall enter into lockup agreements with the
managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten public offering in such form as
agreed to by the Principal Stockholders. The Registrant shall cause its
executive officers, directors and managers (as applicable) and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause other holders of Shares who beneficially own
(within the meaning of Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act as in
effect on the date of this Agreement) 5% or more of the then
outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant (on a fully exchanged basis
assuming all outstanding LLC Units other than those held by the Registrant or
its wholly owned subsidiaries were exchanged for Shares) and holders of any of
the Shares participating in such offering, to enter into lockup agreements
that contain restrictions that are no less restrictive than the restrictions
contained in the lockup agreements executed by Holders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) Holders shall not be subject to such lockup
arrangements unless such Holders had the right to participate in the offering
and (ii) the Blackstone Entities and the BL Entities shall not be subject to
such lockup arrangements so long as they respectively hold less than 5% of the
then outstanding Common Stock of the Registrant (on a fully exchanged basis
assuming all outstanding LLC Units other than those held by the Registrant or
its wholly owned subsidiaries were exchanged for Shares).

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

Section 2.14 _Withdrawals_. Even if shares held by a Holder have
been part of a registered underwritten offering, such Holder may, no later
than the time at which the public offering price and underwriters' discount
are determined with the managing underwriter, decline to sell all or any
portion of the shares being offered for its account.

  



  

Section 2.15 _Expenses_. All Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with any registration statement or registered offering covering
Registrable Securities held by Holders will be borne by the Registrant.
However, underwriters', brokers' and dealers' discounts and commissions
applicable to Shares sold for the account of a Holder will be borne by such
Holder.

  



  

Section 2.16 _Facilitating Registrations and Offerings_.

  



  

(a) If the Registrant becomes obligated under this Agreement to
facilitate a registration and offering of Registrable Securities on behalf of
Holders, the Registrant will do so with the same degree of care and dispatch
as would reasonably be expected in the case of a registration and offering by
the Registrant of Shares for its own account. Without limiting this general
obligation, the Registrant will fulfill its specific obligations as described
in this _Section 2.15_.

  



  

(b) In connection with each registration statement that is demanded
by a Principal Stockholder or as to which piggyback rights otherwise apply,
the Registrant will:

  



  

(i) prepare and file all required filings with the SEC and FINRA,
including preparing and filing with the SEC a registration statement
(including all required exhibits and financial statements) covering the
applicable Shares, file amendments thereto as warranted, seek
the effectiveness thereof, and file with the SEC prospectuses and prospectus
supplements as may be required, all in consultation with the Holders and as
necessary, (a) to comply with the provisions of the applicable securities
laws, (b) permit the offer and sale of the such Shares in accordance with the
applicable plan of distribution and (c) to keep such registration
effective for the period of time required by this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any
registration statement, any prospectus, any amendment to a registration
statement, amendment or supplement to a prospectus or any free writing
prospectus, provide copies of such documents to the selling Holders and to
the underwriter or underwriters of an underwritten offering, if applicable,
and to their respective counsel; make such reasonable changes in any such
documents prior to or after the filing thereof as the counsel to the Holders
or the underwriter or the underwriters may request; and make such of the
representatives of the Registrant as shall be reasonably requested by the
selling Holders or any underwriter available for discussion of such
documents;

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

(iii) within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any document
which is to be incorporated by reference into a registration statement or a
prospectus, provide copies of such document to counsel for the Holders and
underwriters; make such reasonable changes in such document prior to or after
the filing thereof as counsel for such Holders or such underwriter shall
request; and make such of the representatives of the Registrant as shall be
reasonably requested by such counsel available for discussion of such
document;

  



  

(iv) cause each registration statement and the related prospectus and
any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective date of
such registration statement, amendment or supplement and during the
distribution of the registered Shares (x) to comply in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC and (y) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading;

  



  

(v) notify each Holder and its respective counsel promptly, and, if
requested by such Holder, confirm such advice in writing, (A) when any
registration statement, any prospectus, any amendment to a registration
statement, amendment or supplement to a prospectus or any free writing
prospectus has been filed, (B) when a registration statement has become
effective and when any post-effective amendments and supplements thereto
become effective if such registration statement or post-effective amendment is
not automatically effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462 of the
Securities Act, (C) of any comment letter or request by the SEC or any other
federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a
registration statement or related prospectus or for additional information,
(D) of the issuance by the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop
order, injunction or other order or requirement suspending the effectiveness
of a registration statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose, (E) if, between the effective date of a registration statement and
the closing of any sale of securities covered thereby pursuant to any
agreement to which the Registrant is a party, the representations and
warranties of the Registrant contained in such agreement cease to be true and
correct in all material respects or if the Registrant receives any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for
such purpose, and (F) of the happening of any event during the period a
registration statement is effective as a result of which such registration
statement or the related Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

(vi) promptly notify the participating Holders and the managing
underwriter or underwriters, if any, when the Registrant becomes aware of
the happening of any event as a result of which the applicable registration
statement or the prospectus included in such registration statement (as then
in effect) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such
prospectus and any preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, when any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus
includes information that may conflict with the information contained in the
registration statement, or, if for any reason it shall be necessary during
such time period to amend or supplement such registration statement or
prospectus in order to comply with the Securities Act and, in either case as
promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC,
and furnish without charge to the Holders and the managing underwriter
or underwriters, if any, an amendment or supplement to such registration
statement or prospectus which shall correct such misstatement or omission or
effect such compliance;

  



  

(vii) to the extent the Registrant is eligible under the relevant
provisions of Rule 430B under the Securities Act, if the Registrant files any
shelf registration statement, the Registrant shall include in such shelf
registration statement such disclosures as may be required by Rule 430B under
the Securities Act (referring to the unnamed selling security holders in a
generic manner by identifying the initial offering of the securities to the
Holders) in order to ensure that the Holders may be added to such
shelf registration statement at a later time through the filing of a
prospectus supplement rather than a post-effective amendment;

  



  

(viii) promptly incorporate in a prospectus supplement, Issuer Free
Writing prospectus or post-effective amendment such information as
the managing underwriter or underwriters and the participating Holders agree
should be included therein relating to the plan of distribution with respect
to such Registrable Securities; and make all required filings of such
Prospectus supplement, Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or post-effective
amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being notified of the
matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement, Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or post-effective amendment;

  



  

(ix) to use reasonable best efforts to ensure that any Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus utilized in connection with any registration of the Shares
complies in all material respects with the Securities Act, is filed in
accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby, is
retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby
and, when taken together with the related prospectus, will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading

  



  

(x) furnish counsel for each underwriter, if any, and for the
Holders copies of any correspondence with the SEC or any state securities
authority relating to the registration statement or prospectus;

  



  

(xi) otherwise use all reasonable best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including making available to
its security holders an earnings statement covering at least 12 months which
shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder (or any similar provision then in force);

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(xii) use all reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement at
the earliest possible time;

  



  

(xiii) not later than the effective date of the applicable registration
statement, provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities and if
applicable, provide the applicable transfer agent with printed certificates
for the Registrable Securities which are in a form eligible for deposit with
The Depository Trust Company;

  



  

(xiv) take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act;

  



  

(xv) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar
for all Shares covered by a registration statement from and after a date not
later than the effective date of such registration statement; and

  



  

(xvi) take all such other commercially reasonable actions as are
necessary or advisable in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In connection with any non-shelf registered offering or shelf
takedown that is demanded by a Principal Stockholder or as to which piggyback
rights otherwise apply, the Registrant will:

  



  

(i) cooperate with the selling Holders and the sole underwriter or
managing underwriter of an underwritten offering, if any, to facilitate
the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Shares
to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable such Shares to
be in such denominations (consistent with the provisions of the governing
documents thereof) and registered in such names as the selling Holders or the
sole underwriter or managing underwriter of an underwritten offering of
Shares, if any, may reasonably request at least two Business Days prior to
any sale of such Shares;

  



  

(ii) furnish to each Holder and to each underwriter, if any,
participating in the relevant offering, without charge, as many copies of the
applicable prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus, and any
amendment or supplement thereto and such other documents as such Holder or
underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or
other disposition of the Shares; the Registrant hereby consents to the use of
the prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus, by each such Holder and
underwriter in connection with the offering and sale of the Shares covered by
the prospectus or the preliminary prospectus;

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(iii) use all reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Shares being offered and sold, no later than the time the applicable
registration statement becomes effective, under all applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each underwriter, if
any, or any Holder holding Registrable Securities covered by a registration
statement, shall reasonably request; use all reasonable best efforts to keep
each such registration or qualification effective during the period such
registration statement is required to be kept effective; and do any and all
other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable each such underwriter, if any, and each such Holder to consummate the
disposition in each such jurisdiction of such Registrable Securities owned by
such Holder; provided that the Registrant shall not be obligated to qualify as
a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in
which it is not so qualified or to consent to be subject to general service of
process (other than service of process in connection with such registration
or qualification or any sale of Shares in connection therewith) in any such
jurisdiction;

  



  

(iv) use all reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares being
offered and sold, no later than the date on which the pricing of the
relevant offering is expected to occur, to be registered with or approved by
such other governmental agencies or authorities within the United States,
except as may be required solely as a consequence of the nature of the
business of any Holder, in which case the Registrant will cooperate in all
reasonable respects with the filing of the applicable registration statement
and the granting of such approvals, as may be necessary to enable any Holder
or the underwriter, if any, to consummate the disposition of such Shares;

  



  

(v) cause all Shares being sold to be qualified for inclusion in or
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other
securities exchange on which Shares issued by the Registrant are then so
qualified or listed and on each inter-dealer quotation system on which any of
the Registrant's securities are then quoted if so requested by the Holders, or
if so requested by the underwriter or underwriters of an underwritten
offering of Shares, if any;

  



  

(vi) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with
FINRA and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any
underwriter in an underwritten offering;

  



  

(vii) use all reasonable best efforts to facilitate the distribution
and sale of any Shares to be offered pursuant to this Agreement,
including without limitation by making road show presentations, holding
meetings with and making calls to potential investors and taking such other
actions as shall be requested by the Holders or the lead managing underwriter
of an underwritten offering; and

  



  

(viii) enter into customary agreements (including, in the case of an
underwritten offering, underwriting agreements in customary form, and
including provisions with respect to indemnification and contribution in
customary form and consistent with the provisions relating to
indemnification and contribution contained herein) and take all other
customary and appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of such Shares and in connection therewith:

  



  

(A) make such representations and warranties to the selling Holders
and the underwriters, if any, in form, substance and scope as are
customarily made by issuers to underwriters in similar underwritten
offerings;

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(B) obtain opinions of counsel to the Registrant and updates
thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the lead managing underwriter, if any) addressed
to each selling Holder and the underwriters, if any, covering the matters
customarily covered in opinions requested in sales of securities or
underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be reasonably requested
by such Holders and underwriters;

  



  

(C) obtain (a) "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the
Registrant's independent certified public accountants addressed to the
selling Holders, if permissible, and the underwriters, if any, which letters
shall be customary in form and shall cover matters of the type customarily
covered in "comfort" letters to underwriters in connection with primary
underwritten offerings and (b) the required consents from the Registrant's
independent certified public accountants, and if applicable, independent
auditors to include the accountant's or auditors' report, as applicable,
relating to the specified financial statements in the registration statement
and to be named as an expert in the registration statement; and

  



  

(D) to the extent requested and customary for the relevant
transaction, enter into a securities sales agreement with the Holders
providing for, among other things, the appointment of such representative as
agent for the selling Holders for the purpose of soliciting purchases of
Shares, which agreement shall be customary in form, substance and scope and
shall contain customary representations, warranties and covenants.

  



  

The above shall be done at such times as customarily occur in similar
registered offerings or shelf takedowns.

  



  

(d) In connection with each registration and offering of Shares to
be sold by Holders, the Registrant will, in accordance with
customary practice, make available for inspection by representatives of the
Holders and underwriters and any counsel or accountant retained by such
Holder or underwriters all relevant financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Registrant and cause appropriate
officers, managers, employees, outside counsel and accountants of the
Registrant to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, underwriter, counsel or accountant in connection with their
due diligence exercise and to otherwise facilitate and cooperate with the
preparation of registration statement and prospectuses and any amendments
or supplements thereto (including participating in meetings, drafting
sessions, due diligence sessions and rating agency presentations).

  



  

(e) Each Holder that holds Shares covered by any registration
statement will furnish to the Registrant such information regarding itself as
is required to be included in the registration statement or prospectus by the
requirements of the Securities Act, the ownership of Shares by such Holder
and the proposed distribution by such Holder of such Shares as the Registrant
may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

Section 2.17 _In-Kind Distributions_. If any Holder seeks to
effectuate an in-kind distribution of all or part of its Registrable
Securities to its direct or indirect equityholders, the Registrant will,
subject to applicable lockups, work with such Holder and the
Registrant's transfer agent to facilitate such in-kind distribution in the
manner reasonably requested by such Holder, as well as any resales by such
transferees under a shelf registration statement covering such distributed
Shares.

  



  

Section 2.18 _Additional Undertaking_. The Registrant shall
include, in any Registration Statement (as such term is defined in the PIPE
Subscription Agreements), any (a) shares of Common Stock and (b) any shares
of Common Stock underlying warrants, in either case which are distributed (or
distributable) to Lance West or any of his Affiliates by Replay Sponsor, LLC
on account of the ownership interest in Replay Sponsor, LLC by any such
Person (and any other securities issued or issuable as a distribution with
respect to, or in exchange for or in replacement of any such shares, and any
other securities issued or transferred in exchange for or upon conversion of
any of the foregoing shares as a result of a merger, consolidation,
reorganization or otherwise and any other securities issued to any other
holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with any such transaction),
and the Registrant agrees that each such Person shall otherwise be entitled
to all of the rights and benefits applicable to a "Subscriber" under Section
4 of the PIPE Subscription Agreements as if such Person were a Subscriber
thereunder and the shares of Common Stock (and any other securities described
in this sentence) were "Shares" thereunder; provided that the Registrant's
obligation to include such securities in such Registration Statement shall be
subject to the same conditions applicable to a Subscriber under Section 4.1
of the PIPE Subscription Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Indemnification by the Registrant_. In the event of
any registration of any Registrable Securities of the Registrant under the
Securities Act pursuant to Article II, the Registrant hereby indemnifies and
agrees to hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each Holder
who sells Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement, each
Affiliate of such Holder and their respective members, directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, advisors, agents and general and limited partners
(and the directors, officers, employees, Affiliates and controlling Persons
of any of the foregoing), each other Person who participates as an
underwriter in the offering or sale of such Registrable Securities and each
other Person, if any, who controls such Holder or any such underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any and all losses,
penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims, damages or liabilities, joint
or several, and reasonable and documented expenses to which such Indemnified
Party may become subject under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a
party thereto) arise out of or are based upon: (a) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any registration
statement under which such Registrable Securities were registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or any other such disclosure document (including reports
and other documents filed under the Exchange Act and any document
incorporated by reference therein) or related document or report; (b) any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
the case of a prospectus, in the light of the circumstances when they were
made; or (c) any violation or alleged violation by the Registrant or any of
its Subsidiaries of any federal, state, foreign or common law rule or
regulation applicable to the Registrant or any of its Subsidiaries and
relating to action or inaction in connection with any such
registration, disclosure document or related document or report, and the
Registrant will reimburse such Indemnified Party for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by it in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claim,
liability, action or proceeding; provided that the Registrant will not be
liable to any Indemnified Party in any such case to the extent that any such
loss, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claim, damage, liability (or action
or proceeding in respect thereof) or expense arises out of or is based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in such registration statement, in any such preliminary, final
or summary prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information with respect to such
Indemnified Party furnished to the Registrant by such Indemnified Party
expressly for use in the preparation thereof. Such indemnity will remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
such Holder or any Indemnified Party and will survive the Transfer of such
Registrable Securities by such Holder or any termination of this Agreement.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

Section 3.2 _Indemnification by the Holders_. The Registrant may
require, as a condition to including any Registrable Securities in any
registration statement filed in accordance with Article II, that the
Registrant shall have received an undertaking reasonably satisfactory to
it from the Holder of such Registrable Securities or any prospective
underwriter to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the
same extent as set forth in _Section 3.1_) the Registrant, all other Holders
or any prospective underwriter, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers and controlling Persons, with
respect to any untrue statement in or omission from such registration
statement, any preliminary, final or summary prospectus contained therein,
or any amendment or supplement, if such untrue statement or omission was made
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information with respect to
such Holder or underwriter furnished to the Registrant by such Holder or
underwriter expressly for use in the preparation of such registration
statement, preliminary, final or summary prospectus or amendment or
supplement, or a document incorporated by reference into any of the
foregoing. Such indemnity will remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of the Registrant or any of the
Holders, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers or
controlling Persons and will survive the Transfer of such Registrable
Securities by such Holder. In no event shall the liability of any
selling Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in amount than
the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such Holder upon the
sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

Section 3.3 _Notices of Claims, Etc_. Promptly after receipt by
an Indemnified Party hereunder of written notice of the commencement of any
action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be
made pursuant to this Article III, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give written
notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; provided that the
failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein will not
relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under _Section 3.1_ or
_Section 3.2_, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In case any such action is brought
against an Indemnified Party, unless in such Indemnified Party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and
indemnifying parties may exist in respect of such claim, the indemnifying
party will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified to the extent
that it may wish, with counsel selected by the Holders of at least a majority
of the Registrable Securities included in the relevant registration, and after
notice from the indemnifying party to such Indemnified Party of its election
so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable
to such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation. If, in such Indemnified Party's reasonable
judgment, having common counsel would result in a conflict of interest
between the interests of such indemnified and indemnifying parties, then such
Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the
indemnifying party to represent or defend such Indemnified Party in such
action, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying party will not be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys at any time for all such Indemnified Parties (and not more than one
separate firm of local counsel at any time for all such Indemnified Parties)
in such action. No indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of
a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for
hereunder from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party
hereunder in respect of any losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to herein for reasons other
than those described in the proviso in the first sentence of _Section 3.1_,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties in connection with the actions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
such indemnifying party and Indemnified Parties shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates
to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or Indemnified Parties,
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a
party under this _Section 3.4 _as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any
legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. In no event shall the
liability of any selling Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater
in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds actually received by such
Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
contribution obligation.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ were determined by _pro rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 3.5 _Non-Exclusivity_. The obligations of the parties
under this Article IV will be in addition to any liability which any party may
otherwise have to any other party.

  



  

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _OTHER_

  



  

Section 4.1 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other

postage prepaid, return receipt requested, (c) one (1) Business Day after
being sent by Federal Express or other nationally recognized overnight
courier, or (d) if transmitted by email, in each case, to parties at the

Section 4.2 _Transfer Rights_.

  



  

(a) Each Principal Stockholder may transfer, in its sole
discretion, all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to any
Transferee of its Registrable Securities, whereupon such Transferees shall
become a party to this Agreement. Any such Transfer of registration rights
will be effective upon receipt by the Registrant of (i) written notice from
such Principal Stockholder stating the name and address of any Transferee and
identifying the number of Registrable Securities with respect to which rights
under this Agreement are being transferred and the nature of the rights so
transferred, and (ii) a Joinder Agreement from such Person to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement as a "Principal Stockholder" or "Other Holder," as
applicable. The Registrant and the transferring Principal Stockholder will
notify the other Principal Stockholders as to who the Transferees are and the
nature of the rights so transferred.

  



  

(b) In the event the Registrant engages in a merger or
consolidation in which the Registrable Securities are converted into
securities of another Registrant, appropriate arrangements will be made so
that the registration rights provided under this Agreement continue to be
provided to Holders by the issuer of such securities. To the extent such new
issuer, or any other company acquired by the Registrant in a merger or
consolidation, was bound by registration rights obligations that would
conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the Registrant will, unless
Holders then holding a majority of the Registrable Securities otherwise agree,
use its reasonable best efforts to modify any such "inherited" registration
rights obligations so as not to interfere in any material respects with the
rights provided under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In the case of an in-kind distribution of Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.17_ of this Agreement with an ability to resale Shares off of a
shelf registration statement, such in-kind transferees will, as transferee
Holders, be entitled to the rights under this Agreement applicable to the
Shares so transferred. In that regard, however, in-kind transferees will not
be given demand or piggyback rights; rather their means of registered resale
will be limited to sales off a shelf with respect to which no special actions
are required by the Registrant or the other Holders, and as to which no lockup
will arise.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Registrant effects the separation of any
portion of its business into one or more entities (each, a " _NewCo_
"), whether existing or newly formed, including without limitation by way of
spin-off, split-off, carve-out, demerger, recapitalization, reorganization or
similar transaction, and any Holder will receive equity interests in any such
NewCo as part of such separation, the Registrant shall cause any such NewCo
to enter into a registration rights agreement with each such Holder that
provides each such Holder with registration rights vis-a-vis such NewCo that
are substantially identical to those set forth in this Agreement..

  



  

Section 4.3 _Current Public Information_. At all times after the
Registrant has filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the
requirements of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, the Registrant
shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and shall take such further action as any Holder or
Holders of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent
required to enable such Holders to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to
Rule 144\. Upon request, the Registrant shall deliver to any holder of
restricted securities under Rule 144 a written statement as to whether it
has complied with such requirements.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 4.4 _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, neither the members, stockholders, general
partners, limited partners, advisory directors or managing directors, or any
directors or officers of any members, stockholders, general or
limited partners, advisory directors or managing directors, nor any future
members, stockholders, general partners, limited partners, advisory
directors, or managing directors, if any, of any Holder shall have any
personal liability for performance of any obligation of such Holder under
this Agreement in excess of the respective capital contributions of such
members, stockholders, general partners, limited partners, advisory directors
or managing directors to such Holder.

  



  

Section 4.5 _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Registrant will
not, on or after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with
respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights granted under
or otherwise conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified, or any provision waived, only by a written
instrument executed by the Registrant and the Holders holding a majority of
the Registrable Securities subject to this Agreement; provided that: (i) any
amendment or waiver that would have an adverse effect on any Principal
Stockholder shall require the written consent of such Principal Stockholder;
and (ii) any amendment or waiver which adversely affects the economic

"Medicare" contribution tax imposed on certain investment income under Section
1411 of the Code) for a Tax Year prescribed for an individual (or, if
greater, a corporation) resident in California or New York, New York
(whichever tax rate is higher) at the time of such distribution, taking into
account (a) the deductibility of state and local income taxes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (if applicable, and taking into account any
limitations thereon) and (b) the character (e.g., long-term or short-term
capital gain or ordinary or exempt income) of the applicable income. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Assumed Tax Rate shall be the same for all Members.

  



  

" _Available Cash_ " means, with respect to any fiscal period, the amount of
cash on hand which the Board, in its sole discretion, deems available for
distribution to the Members, taking into account all debts, liabilities and

" _Carrying Value_ " means, with respect to any Company asset, the asset's
adjusted basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except that the initial
carrying value of assets contributed to the Company shall be their respective
gross fair market values on the date of contribution as determined by the
Board in its sole discretion, and the Carrying Values of all Company assets
shall be adjusted to equal their respective fair market values, in accordance
with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), except as otherwise provided herein, as of: (a) the
date of the acquisition of any additional limited liability company
interest in the Company by any new or existing Member in exchange for more

economic interests of the Members. The Carrying Value of any Company asset
distributed to any Member shall be adjusted immediately before such
distribution to equal its fair market value. In the case of any asset that
has a Carrying Value that differs from its adjusted tax basis, Carrying
Value shall be adjusted by the amount of depreciation calculated for purposes
of the definition of "Profits" and "Losses" rather than the amount of
depreciation determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and depreciation
shall be calculated by reference to Carrying Value rather than tax basis once
Carrying Value differs from tax basis.

set forth in any effective Award Agreement, employment agreement or other
written contract of engagement entered into between the Company and such
Service Provider, or if none, then "Cause" means any of the following: (A)

with or service to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or a
breach of the duty of loyalty to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; (B) performing an act of race, sex, national origin, religion,
disability, or age based discrimination or any other form of discrimination
against a protected class under applicable state and federal law which after
investigation, counsel to the Company reasonably concludes will result in
liability being imposed on the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and/or
such Service Provider; (C) such Service Provider's material violation of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries' policies and procedures including,
but not limited to, the Code of Business Conduct; (D) such Service Provider's
material noncompliance with any of the terms of this Agreement, any Award
Agreement or any non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and/or

employment agreement; or (E) performing any criminal act resulting in a
criminal felony charge brought against such Service Provider or a criminal
conviction of such Service Provider (other than conviction of a minor traffic
violation).

" _Certificate_ " means the Certificate of Formation of the Company as filed
in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 1,
2020, as amended and/or restated from time to time.

  



  

" _Class_ " means the classes of Units into which the limited liability
company interests in the Company may be classified or divided from time to
time by the Board in its sole discretion pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement. As of the Effective Date, the only Class of Units is the Class A
Units. Subclasses within a Class shall not be separate Classes for purposes of
this Agreement. For all purposes hereunder and under the Act, only such
Classes expressly established under this Agreement, including by the Board in
accordance with this Agreement, shall be deemed to be a class of Units. For
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the Corporation holds limited
liability company interests of any Class, the Corporation shall not be deemed
to hold a separate Class of such interests from any other Member because it
has the sole authority to appoint, remove and replace the Managers on the
Board.

Agreement.

measured with respect to net income or profits); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not pay or bear any income tax obligations of the
Corporation or any obligations of the Corporation under the Tax Receivable
Agreements. Reimbursements pursuant to this _Section 3.08(b)_ shall be in
addition to (but without duplication of) any indemnification or advancement
of expenses made to the Board pursuant to _Section 10.03_.

Section 3.10. _Authority of Members_. No Member (other than the
Corporation), in its capacity as such, shall participate in or have any
control over the management or business of the Company. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Units do not confer any rights upon the
Members to participate in the affairs of the Company described in this
Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no Member (other
than the Corporation) shall have any right to vote on any matter involving the
Company, including with respect to any merger, consolidation, combination,
conversion or division of the Company, or any other matter that a
Member might otherwise have the ability to vote on or consent with respect to
under the Act, at law, in equity or otherwise. Except with respect to the
rights of the Corporation hereunder, the conduct, control and management of
the Company shall be vested exclusively in the Board. Except with respect to
the rights of the Corporation hereunder, in all matters relating to or arising
out of the conduct of the operation of the Company, the decision of the Board
shall be the decision of the Company. Except as required or permitted by Law,
or expressly provided in the ultimate sentence of this _Section 3.10 _or by
separate agreement with the Company, no Member (other than the Corporation as
set forth herein) shall take any part in the management or control of
the operation or business of the Company, in its capacity as a Member, nor
shall any Member (other than the Corporation as set forth herein) have any
right, authority or power to act for or on behalf of or bind the Company in
his or its capacity as a Member in any respect or assume any obligation or
responsibility of the Company or of any other Member. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may from time to time appoint one or more Persons who
are Members as Officers or employ one or more Persons who are Members as
employees, and such Persons, in their capacity as Officers or employees of the
Company (and not, for clarity, in their capacity as members of the Company),
may take part in the control and management of the business of the Company to
the extent such authority and power to act for or on behalf of the Company
has been delegated to them by the Board.

Article IV

  



  

DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

Section 4.01. _Distributions_

  



  

(a) The Board, in its sole discretion, may authorize distributions
by the Company to the Members who are listed as Members on the Schedule of
Members as of the date the distribution is made, which distributions shall be
made _pro rata_ in accordance with such Members' respective Total Percentage
Interests on the date the distribution is made.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(b) (i) In addition to _Section 4.01(a)_, if the Board reasonably
determines that the taxable income of the Company for a Tax Year will give
rise to taxable income for the Members (" _Net Taxable Income_ "), the Board
shall cause the Company to distribute Available Cash in respect of income tax
liabilities (the " _Tax Distributions_ ") to the extent that other
distributions made by the Company for such year were otherwise insufficient to
cover such tax liabilities. The aggregate Tax Distributions payable with
respect to any Fiscal Year shall be computed based upon the Board's estimate
of the allocable Net Taxable Income in accordance with _Article V_,
multiplied by the Assumed Tax Rate (the " _Tax Amount_ ") and shall be made
to Members _pro rata_ in accordance with the Members' respective Total
Percentage Interest on the date the Tax Distribution is made. Any Tax
Distributions made pursuant to this _Section 4.01(b)_ shall be made to the
Members who are listed as Members on the Schedule of Members as of the date
the distribution is made. For purposes of computing the Tax Amount, the Net
Taxable Income shall be determined without regard to any special adjustments
of tax items required as a result of any election under Section 754 of the
Code, including adjustments required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

  



  

(ii) Tax Distributions shall be calculated and paid no later than one day
prior to each quarterly due date for the payment by corporations on a calendar
year of estimated taxes under the Code in the following manner: (A) for the
first quarterly period, 25% of the Tax Amount, (B) for the second quarterly
period, 50% of the Tax Amount, less the prior Tax Distributions for the Fiscal
Year, (C) for the third quarterly period, 75% of the Tax Amount, less the
prior Tax Distributions for the Fiscal Year and (D) for the fourth quarterly
period, 100% of the Tax Amount, less the prior Tax Distributions for the
Fiscal Year; _provided_ that the Board may recalculate the Tax Amount prior
to any quarterly payment as determined in its reasonable discretion. Following
each Fiscal Year, and no later than one day prior to the due date for the
payment by corporations of income taxes for such Tax Year, the Board shall
make an amended calculation of the Tax Amount for such Tax Year (the "
_Amended Tax Amount_ "), and shall cause the Company to distribute a Tax
Distribution, out of Available Cash, to the extent that the Amended Tax Amount
so calculated exceeds the cumulative Tax Distributions previously made by the
Company in respect of such Tax Year. If the Amended Tax Amount is less than
the cumulative Tax Distributions previously made by the Company in respect of
the relevant Tax Year, then the difference (the " _Credit Amount_ ") shall be
applied against, and shall reduce, the amount of Tax Distributions made for
subsequent Tax Years. Within 30 days following the date on which the Company
files a tax return on Form 1065, the Board shall make a final calculation of
the Tax Amount of such Tax Year (the " _Final Tax Amount_ ") and shall cause
the Company to distribute a Tax Distribution, out of Available Cash, to the
extent that the Final Tax Amount so calculated exceeds the Amended Tax Amount.
If the Final Tax Amount is less than the Amended Tax Amount in respect of the
relevant Tax Year, then the difference (" _Additional Credit Amount_ ") shall
be applied against, and shall reduce, the amount of Tax Distributions made for
subsequent Tax Years. Any Credit Amount and Additional Credit Amount applied
against future Tax Distributions shall be treated as an amount
actually distributed pursuant to this _Section 4.01(b)_ for purposes of the
computations herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent there is
Available Cash, the total distributions paid to the Corporation (in its
capacity as a member of the Company) pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section
4.01(b) with respect to a Tax Year shall not be less than the sum of any U.S.
federal, state, local and foreign tax obligations owed by the Corporation for
such Tax Year (other than any obligations to remit any amounts withheld from
payments to third parties).

  



  

(c) If all or a portion of a Member's Units are Transferred, and
the Transferee is admitted as a substitute Member of the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.09,_ then the transferor shall have no further right to receive
any further distributions pursuant to this _Section 4.01_ in respect of such
Units and any subsequent Tax Distributions to the Transferee shall be
determined with regard to amounts previously distributed to the transferor in
respect of the same Fiscal Year.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

Section 4.02. _Liquidation Distribution_. Distributions made upon
dissolution of the Company shall be made as provided in _Section 9.03_.

  



  

Section 4.03. _Limitations on Distribution_. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, and the
Board on behalf of the Company, shall not make a distribution to any Member
if such distribution would violate Section 18-607 of the Act or other
applicable Law.

  



  

Article V

  



  

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS; CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; 
 TAX ALLOCATIONS; TAX MATTERS

  



  

Section 5.01. _Initial Capital Contributions_. The Members have made,
on or prior to the date hereof, Capital Contributions and, in exchange, the
Company has issued to the Members the number of Class A Units as specified in
the Schedule of Members (as of the Effective Date).

  



  

Section 5.02. _No Additional Capital Contributions_. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Article V_, no Member shall be required to make
additional Capital Contributions to the Company without the consent of such
Member or permitted to make additional capital contributions to the Company
without the consent of the Board, which may be granted or withheld in the
Board's sole discretion.

  



  

Section 5.03. _Capital Accounts_. A separate capital account (a "
_Capital Account_ ") shall be established and maintained for each Member in
accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). The Capital Account of each Member shall be credited with
such Member's Capital Contributions, if any, all Profits allocated to such
Member pursuant to _Section 5.04_ and any items of income or gain which are
specially allocated pursuant to _Section 5.05_; and shall be debited with
all Losses allocated to such Member pursuant to _Section 5.04_, any items of
loss or deduction of the Company specially allocated to such Member pursuant
to _Section 5.05_, and all cash and the Carrying Value of any property (net
of liabilities assumed by such Member and the liabilities to which such
property is subject) distributed by the Company to such Member. Any
references in any section of this Agreement to the Capital Account of a Member
shall be deemed to refer to such Capital Account as the same may be credited
or debited from time to time as set forth above. In the event of any Transfer
of any Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Transferee
shall succeed to the Capital Account of the transferor to the extent it
relates to the transferred Units.

  



  

Section 5.04. _Allocations of Profits and Losses_. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, Profits and Losses (and, to the extent
necessary, individual items of income, gain or loss or deduction of the
Company) shall be allocated in a manner such that the Capital Account of each
Member after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in _Section
5.05 _is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to (i) the
distributions that would be made pursuant to _Article IX _if the Company
were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to
their Carrying Value in a hypothetical liquidation, all Company liabilities
were satisfied (limited with respect to each non-recourse liability to the
Carrying Value of the assets securing such liability) and the net assets of
the Company were distributed to the Members pursuant to this Agreement,
_minus_ (ii) such Member's share of Company Minimum Gain and Member
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the
hypothetical sale of assets; _provided_ , that for purposes of this _Article
V_, each Unvested Unit shall be treated as a Vested Unit, it being understood
that where vesting is dependent upon the economic performance of the Company,
any applicable Unvested Units shall be treated as Vested Units only to the
extent such Unvested Units would become Vested Units in connection with
such hypothetical liquidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
allocations may be adjusted as reasonably deemed necessary by the Board,
acting in good faith, to give economic effect to the provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  



  

Section 5.05. _Special Allocations_. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this _Article V_:

  



  

(a) _Minimum Gain Chargeback_. If there is a net decrease in
Company Minimum Gain or Member Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain (determined
in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(d)
and 1.704-2(i)) during any Company Tax Year, the Members shall be specially
allocated items of Company income and gain for such year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to their respective shares of such net
decrease during such year, determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items to be so allocated shall be
determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). This
_Section 5.05(a)_ is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirements in such Treasury Regulations Sections and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith; including that no chargeback shall be required to the
extent of the exceptions provided in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)
and 1.704-2(i)(4).

  



  

(b) _Qualified Income Offset_. If any Member unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of Company
income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate the deficit balance in such Member's Adjusted
Capital Account Balance created by such adjustments, allocations or
distributions as promptly as possible; _provided_ that an allocation pursuant
to this  _Section 5.05(b)_ shall be made only to the extent that a Member
would have a deficit Adjusted Capital Account Balance in excess of such sum
after all other allocations provided for in this _Article V_ have been
tentatively made as if this _Section 5.05(b)_ were not in this Agreement.
This _Section 5.05(b)_ is intended to comply with the "qualified income
offset" requirement of the Code and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

  



  

(c) _Gross Income Allocation_. If any Member has a deficit
Capital Account at the end of any Tax Year which is in excess of the sum
of (i) the amount such Member is obligated to restore, if any, pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement, and (ii) the amount such Member is deemed to
be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall
be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such
excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this
_Section 5.05(c)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that a Member
would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other
allocations provided for in this _Article V_ have been tentatively made as
if _Section 5.05(b)_ and this _Section 5.05(c)_ were not in this Agreement.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(d) _Nonrecourse Deductions_. Nonrecourse Deductions shall be
allocated to the Members in accordance with their respective Total
Percentage Interests.

  



  

(e) _Member Nonrecourse Deductions_. Member Nonrecourse
Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated to the Member who bears
the economic risk of loss with respect to the liability to which such Member
Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(j).

  



  

(f) _LTIP Deductions_. Any deductions attributable to the LTIP
Plan shall be allocated to the Members as of immediately prior to the Closing
who directly or indirectly bore the cost of the applicable payment pursuant to
the LTIP Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, no deduction attributable to the
LTIP Plan shall be allocated to the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries,
except to the extent attributable to a payment pursuant to the LTIP Plan that
is borne by the Blocker GP or the Blocker Shareholders.

  



  

(g) _Ameliorative Allocations_. Any special allocations of income
or gain pursuant to _Sections 5.05(b)_ or _5.05(c)_ shall be taken into
account in computing subsequent allocations pursuant to _Section 5.04_ and
this _Section 5.05(g)_, so that the net amount of any items so allocated and
all other items allocated to each Member shall, to the fullest extent
possible, be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each
Member if such allocations pursuant to _Sections 5.05(b)_ or  _5.05(c)_ had
not occurred.

  



  

Section 5.06. _Tax Allocations_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes,
each item of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company shall be
allocated among the Members in the same manner as the corresponding items of
Profits and Losses and specially allocated items are allocated for Capital
Account purposes; _provided_ that in the case of any asset the Carrying Value
of which differs from its adjusted tax basis for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall
be allocated solely for income tax purposes in accordance with the principles
of Sections 704(b) and (c) of the Code (in any manner permitted by the Code
and Treasury Regulations, as determined by the Board, with the prior consent
of (i) the BL Investors holding a majority of the then outstanding Class A
Units held by all BL Investors and (ii) the Blackstone Investors holding a
majority of the then outstanding Class A Units held by all Blackstone
Investors) so as to take account of the difference between Carrying Value and
adjusted basis of such asset using such methods as are determined by the Board
and which are permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such allocations may be adjusted as reasonably
deemed necessary by the Board, acting in good faith, to give economic effect
to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 5.07. _Tax Advances_. To the extent the Board reasonably
believes that the Company is required by Law to withhold or to make
tax payments on behalf of or with respect to any Member or the Company is
subjected to tax itself by reason of the status of any Member (including any
taxes paid pursuant to Section 6225 of the Code) (" _Tax Advances_ "), the
Board may cause the Company to withhold such amounts and cause the Company to
make such tax payments as so required. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a
Member shall be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next
succeeding distribution or distributions which would otherwise have been made
to such Member (including Tax Distributions) or, if such distributions are not
sufficient for that purpose, by so reducing distributions upon dissolution of
the Company otherwise payable to such Member. For all purposes of
this Agreement, such Member shall be treated as having received the amount of
the distribution that is equal to the Tax Advance. Each Member hereby agrees,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and the other Members from and against any liability
(including, without limitation, any liability for taxes, penalties, additions
to tax or interest other than any penalties, additions to tax or interest
imposed as a result of the Company's failure to withhold or make a tax
payment on behalf of such Member which withholding or payment is required
pursuant to applicable Law, but only to the extent amounts sufficient to pay
such taxes were not timely distributed to the Member pursuant to _Section
4.01(b)_) with respect to income attributable to or distributions or other
payments to such Member. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law
and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each Member
hereby agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the other Members from and against
any liability (including any liability for taxes, penalties, additions to Tax
or interest) with respect to any such Tax Advance with respect to a
Member. The obligation of a Member set forth in this _Section 5.07_ shall,
to the fullest extent permitted applicable Law, survive the withdrawal of a
Member from the Company or any Transfer of a Member's Units.

  



  

Section 5.08. _Tax Matters_. For Tax Years beginning on or before
December 31, 2017, the Corporation shall act or appoint a "tax matters
partner" within the meaning of Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code (prior to
amendment by the Partnership Audit Provisions) (the " _Tax Matters Partner_
"). For Tax Years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the
Corporation shall act as or designate a Person to act as the "partnership
representative" pursuant to the Partnership Audit Provisions (the "
_Partnership Representative_ ") and a "designated individual" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.6223-1(b) (the " _Designated
Individual_ "); and each such Person shall have the power to exercise any and
all rights that it is or may be entitled to exercise in such capacity. The
Partnership Representative shall keep the other Members reasonably informed
as to any material tax actions, examinations or proceedings relating to the
Company and shall submit to the other Members, for their review and comment,
any material settlement or compromise offer with respect to any disputed item
of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Company. The Members shall
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative in
connection with any election or decision made by the Partnership
Representative acting in that capacity (including by filing amended tax
returns and providing information requested). In the event the Company incurs
or is required to pay any liability for taxes, interest or penalties pursuant
to the Partnership Audit Provisions, then, to the extent such election is in
the best interests of the Company and the Members, the Partnership
Representative shall cause the Company to make an election under Section 6226
of the Code (a " _Section 6226 Election_"), if available; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Partnership Representative shall cause the Company to
make a Section 6226 Election with respect to all periods subject to the
Partnership Audit Provisions prior to the admission of the Corporation as a
member of the Company and for the period in which the Corporation is first
admitted as a member of the Company. If a Section 6226 Election is made, the
Partnership Representative shall provide to the Members the Members'
respective shares of any adjustment to income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit (as determined in the notice of final partnership adjustment). If a
Section 6226 Election is not available or such election is not in the best
interests of the Company and the Members, then: (i) the
Partnership Representative shall use reasonable efforts to reduce under
Section 6225(c) of the Code any Company-level assessment under the
Partnership Audit Provisions to reflect the particular tax status of any
Member (or its constituent owners); and (ii) the Members (including any
former Member) to whom such liability relates shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, indemnify the Company and other Members from and
against such liability pursuant to _Section 5.07_.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

Section 5.09. _Other Allocation Provisions_. Certain of the foregoing
provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to
the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b) and shall be interpreted and applied in a
manner consistent with such regulations. In addition to amendments effected in
accordance with _Section 11.12 _or otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement, _Sections 5.03_ , _5.04_ and _5.05_ (other than _Section
5.05(f)_) may also, so long as any such amendment does not materially change
the relative economic interests of the Members, be amended at any time by the
Board if necessary, in the opinion of tax counsel to the Company, to comply
with such regulations or any applicable Law; _provided_ that no such
amendment that would adversely impact (i) the BL Investors may be made without
the prior written consent of the BL Investors holding a majority of the then
outstanding Class A Units held by all BL Investors and (ii) the Blackstone
Investors may be made without the prior written consent of the Blackstone
Investors holding a majority of the then outstanding Class A Units held by
all Blackstone Investors.

by February 15, May 15 and August 15 of such Tax Year, with an estimate of
the taxable income, gains, deductions, losses and other items for,
respectively, the first, second and third fiscal quarters that such Person
will be required to include in its taxable income and (ii) by November 1 of
such Tax Year, with an estimate of the taxable income, gains,
deductions, losses and other items of such Person to be reflected on the

the Corporation), for such period of time as the Board determines in its sole
discretion, (i) any information that the Board reasonably believes to be in
the nature of trade secrets or (ii) other information the disclosure of which
the Board believes is not in the best interests of the Company, could damage
the Company or its business or that the Company is required by Law or by
agreement with any third party to keep confidential, including
without limitation, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
information as to the Units held by any other Member. With respect to any
schedules, annexes or exhibits to this Agreement, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each Member (other than the Corporation) shall
only be entitled to receive and review any such schedules, annexes and
exhibits relating to such Member and shall not be entitled to receive or
review any schedules, annexes or exhibits relating to any other Member
(other than the Corporation).

  



  

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the rights
to information granted to the Members pursuant to this Agreement
shall replace in their entirety any rights to information provided for in
Section 18-305(a) of the Act, and each of the Members hereby agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that they do not have any rights
as members of the Company or otherwise to receive any information pursuant to
Section 18-305(a) of the Act.

  



  

Article VII

  



  

COMPANY UNITS

  



  

Section 7.01. _Units_. Limited liability company interests in the
Company shall be represented by Units. At the execution of this Agreement, the
Units are comprised of one Class: "Class A Units." The Board in its sole
discretion may establish and issue, from time to time in accordance with such
procedures as the Board shall determine from time to time, additional Units,
in one or more Classes or series of Units, or other Company securities,
vested or unvested, at such price, and entitling the Members holding such
Class or series of Units to such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional, special or other rights, powers and duties (which
may be senior to those of existing Units, Classes and series of Units or other
Company securities), as shall be determined by the Board in its sole
discretion, including: (i) the rights of the Members holding such Units to
share in Profits and Losses or items thereof; (ii) the rights of the Members
holding such Units to share in Company distributions; (iii) the rights of the
Members holding such Units upon dissolution and liquidation of the Company;
(iv) whether, and the terms and conditions upon which, the Company may or
shall be required to redeem such Units (including sinking fund provisions);
(v) whether the Members holding such Units have the privilege of conversion
or exchange and, if so, the terms and conditions of such conversion or
exchange; (vi) the terms and conditions upon which such Units will be issued,
evidenced by certificates and Transferred; (vii) the method for determining
the Total Percentage Interest as to such Units; (viii) the terms and
conditions of the issuance of such Units (including, without limitation, the

respect thereof, the Board being expressly authorized, in its sole discretion,
to cause the Company to issue such Units for less than fair market value);
and (ix) the right, if any, of the Members holding such Units to vote on
Company matters, including matters relating to the relative designations,

outstanding Units or a Class or series of outstanding Units , in each case, by

such change without further act, vote, approval or consent of the Members or
any other Person notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
Agreement or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Act or
any other applicable Law. All Members holding Units of a particular Class
shall have identical rights in all respects as all other Units of such Class,
except in each case as otherwise specified in this Agreement.

Section 7.02. _Register; Certificates; Legends_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall maintain a schedule of Units, other Company
securities and all Members setting forth: (i) the name and address of each
Member; (ii) the aggregate number of Units and the aggregate number of each
Class or series of Units or other Company securities; (iii) the aggregate
number of Units and the aggregate number of each Class or series of Units
or other Company securities held by each Member or Assignee; (iv) whether
such Units are Unvested Units; and (v) the Capital Contributions made or
deemed made by each Member (such schedule, as amended and/or restated in

series thereof, other Company securities and all relevant information with
respect to each Member and Assignee.

  



  

(b) Unless the Board in its sole discretion shall determine
otherwise by resolution, Units shall be uncertificated and recorded in the
Schedule of Members.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(c) If the Board determines by resolution that one or more Classes
or series of Units shall be certificated, then the provisions of this 
_Section 7(c)_ shall apply to such Class or series of Units. Each Unit of
such Class or series shall constitute a "security" within the meaning of, and
be governed by, (i) Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (including
Section 8-102(a)(15) thereof) as in effect from time to time in the State of
Delaware and (ii) Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code of any other
applicable jurisdiction that now or hereafter substantially includes the 1994
versions of Article 8 thereof as adopted by the American law Institute and
the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and approved
by the American Bar Association on February 14, 1995 and the Company hereby
"opts-in" to such provisions for the purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code.
The Company shall maintain books and records for the purposes of
registering the Transfer of such Class or series of Units (which records may
be the Schedule of Members) and, notwithstanding anything otherwise to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Transfer of any Unit of such Class or series
shall require the delivery of an endorsed certificate and any Transfer of a
Unit of such Class or series shall not be deemed effective until the
Transfer is registered on the books and records of the Company (which books
and records may be the Schedule of Members). Each Unit of such Class or
series shall be represented by a certificate substantially in the form
attached hereto and incorporated herein under by reference as _Exhibit A_ (a
" _Unit Certificate_ "), and shall bear a legend in substantially
the following form:

  



  

THE SECURITIES PRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY OTHER STATE OR FOREIGN
SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, OR TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN
COMPLIANCE THEREWITH THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE ALSO
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN THE AMENDED AND

EQUITY CAPITAL LLC UPON REQUEST.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this Agreement, to the
extent that any provision of this _Section 7.02(c)_ is inconsistent with the
non-waivable provisions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect from time to time in the State of Delaware, the provisions of Article
8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in the State
of Delaware shall control.

  



  

Section 7.03. _Registered Members_

  



  

. The Company shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a Person
listed on the Schedule of Members as the owner of Units for all purposes and
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in Units on the part of any other Person, whether or not it shall
have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the Act
or other applicable Law.

Article VIII

  



  

VESTING; FORFEITURE OF INTERESTS; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

  



  

Section 8.01. _Vesting of Unvested Units_.

  



  

(a) Unvested Units shall vest and shall thereafter be Vested Units
for all purposes of this Agreement as agreed to in writing between the
Board and the applicable Member and reflected in the Schedule of Members.

  



  

(b) The Board in its sole discretion may authorize the earlier
vesting of all or a portion of Unvested Units owned by any one or
more Members at any time and from time to time, and in such event, such
Unvested Units shall vest and thereafter be Vested Units for all purposes of
this Agreement. Any such determination in the Board's discretion in respect of
Unvested Units shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, be
final and binding. Such determinations need not be uniform and may be
made selectively among Members, whether or not such Members are similarly
situated, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, not
constitute the breach by any Manager of this Agreement or of any duty
(including any fiduciary duty) hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in
equity or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Upon the vesting of any Unvested Units in accordance with this
_Section 8.01,_ the Board shall amend or amend and restate the Schedule of
Members to reflect such vesting without further act, vote, approval or consent
of the Members or any other Person notwithstanding anything otherwise to the
contrary in this Agreement or the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
the Act or any other applicable Law.

  



  

Section 8.02. _Forfeiture of Units_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing between the Board and
the applicable Person and reflected in the Schedule of Members, if a
Person that is a Service Provider ceases to be a Service Provider for any
reason, all Unvested Units held by such Person (or any Personal Planning
Vehicle of such Person), and/or in which such Person (or any Personal Planning
Vehicle of such Person) has an indirect interest, as set forth in the
Schedule of Members, shall be immediately forfeited without any consideration,
and any such Person (or any such Personal Planning Vehicle) shall cease to
own or have any rights, directly or indirectly, with respect to such
forfeited Unvested Units.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing between the Board and
the applicable Person and reflected in the Schedule of Members, if the Board
determines in good faith that Cause exists with respect to any Person that is
or was at any time a Service Provider, the Units (whether or not vested) held
by such Person (or any Personal Planning Vehicle of such Person), and/or in
which such Person (or any Personal Planning Vehicle of such Person) has an
indirect interest, as set forth in the Schedule of Members, shall
be immediately forfeited without any consideration, and any such Person (or
any such Personal Planning Vehicle) shall cease to own or have any rights,
directly or indirectly, with respect to such forfeited Units. Such
determinations need not be uniform and may be made selectively among such
Persons, whether or not such Persons are similarly situated, and shall to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, not constitute the breach by any
Manager of this Agreement or of any duty (including any fiduciary duty)
hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Upon the forfeiture of any Units in accordance with this
_Section 8.02_, such Units shall be cancelled and the Board shall amend or
amend and restate the Schedule of Members to reflect such forfeiture and
cancellation, without further act, vote, approval or consent of the Members
or any other Person notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
Agreement or, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Act or
any other applicable Law.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

Section 8.03. _Member Transfers_

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise agreed to in writing between the Board and
the applicable Member and reflected in the Schedule of Members or as
otherwise expressly provided in this _Article VIII_, no Member or Assignee
may Transfer (including pursuant to an Exchange Transaction) all or any
portion of its Units or other Company securities (or beneficial interest
therein) without the prior consent of the Board, which consent may be given
or withheld, or made subject to such conditions (including, without
limitation, the receipt of such legal opinions and other documents that the
Board may require) as are determined by the Board, in each case, in the
Board's sole discretion, and which consent may be in the form of a plan or
program entered into or approved by the Board, in its sole discretion. Any
such determination in the Board's discretion in respect of the Transfer of
Units or other Company securities shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, be final and binding. Such determinations need not be uniform
and may be made selectively among Members, whether or not such Members are
similarly situated, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, not constitute the breach by any Manager of this Agreement or of any duty
(including any fiduciary duty) hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in
equity or otherwise. Any purported Transfer of Units that is not in accordance
with, or subsequently violates, this Agreement shall be, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, null and void.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall not
unreasonably withhold its prior consent to any Transfer of Units: (i) by will
or intestacy; (ii) as a bona fide gift or gifts; (iii) to any trust,
partnership, limited liability company or other entity for the direct or
indirect benefit of the Member or Assignee or the immediate family of such
Member or Assignee; (iv) to any immediate family member or other dependent of
the Member or Assignee; (v) as a distribution to limited partners, members or
stockholders of the Member or Assignee; (vi) to the Member's or Assignee's
Affiliates or to any investment fund or other entity controlled or managed by
the Member or Assignee; (vii) to a nominee or custodian of a person or entity
to whom a disposition or transfer would be permissible under the foregoing
clauses (i) through (vi); or (viii) pursuant to an order of a court or
regulatory agency to which the Member or Assignee or the Member's or
Assignee's Unit are subject.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
_Section 8.03_, without the consent of the Board or any other Person,
each Member that is a Principal Stockholder may Transfer or otherwise create
an Encumbrance with respect to all or any portion of its Units in a Transfer
not in violation of _Section 8.06(b)_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
_Section 8.03_, each Member may Transfer Vested Units that are vested as of
the date of such Exchange Transaction in an Exchange Transaction pursuant to,
and in accordance with, the Exchange Agreement, including, for clarity, that
in the case of any Member other than a Principal Stockholder, such Exchange
Transaction shall be effected in compliance with reasonable policies that the
Board may adopt or promulgate from time to time (including policies
requiring the use of designated administrators or brokers) in its sole
discretion.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
_Section 8.03_, the Board may implement policies and procedures to
permit the Transfer of Units by the Members for personal planning purposes
and any such Transfer effected in compliance with such policies and
procedures shall not require the prior consent of the Board.

  



  

Section 8.04. _Mandatory Exchanges_. The Board may in its sole
discretion at any time and from time to time, without the consent of any
Member or other Person, cause to be Transferred in an Exchange Transaction
any and all Units, other than Units held by a Principal Stockholder at the
time in question and/or a Person that is wholly-owned, directly or indirectly,
as reflected in the Schedule of Members by Principal Stockholders at the time
in question. Any such determinations by the Board need not be uniform and may
be made selectively among Members, whether or not such Members are similarly
situated, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, not
constitute the breach by any Manager of this Agreement or of any duty
(including any fiduciary duty) hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in
equity or otherwise. In addition, the Board may, with the consent of (i) the
BL Investors holding a majority of the then outstanding Class A Units held by
all BL Investors, (ii) the Blackstone Investors holding a majority of the
then outstanding Class A Units held by all Blackstone Investors and (iii)
Members whose Vested Percentage Interests exceed 66 2/3% of the Vested
Percentage Interests of all Members in the aggregate, require all Members to
Transfer in an Exchange Transaction all Units held by them. For the avoidance
of doubt, any exchange pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ shall be treated as
an Exchange pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreements.

  



  

Section 8.05. _Encumbrances_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, no Member or Assignee may create an Encumbrance with respect to all
or any portion of its Units or other Company securities (or any beneficial
interest therein) other than Encumbrances that run in favor of the Member
unless the Board consents in writing thereto, which consent may be given or
withheld, or made subject to such conditions as are determined by the Board,
in the Board's sole discretion. Consent of the Board pursuant to the foregoing
sentence shall be withheld until the holder of the Encumbrance acknowledges
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any purported Encumbrance that is
not in accordance with this Agreement shall be, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, null and void.

  



  

Section 8.06. _Further Restrictions_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, the
Board may impose such additional vesting requirements, forfeiture provisions,
Transfer restrictions, minimum retained ownership requirements or other
similar provisions with respect to any Units that are outstanding as of the
Effective Date or any Units or other Company securities that are created
thereafter, with the written consent of the holder of such Units or other
Company securities. Such requirements, provisions and restrictions need not be
uniform and may be waived or released by the Board in its sole discretion
with respect to all or a portion of the Units or other Company
securities owned by such holder at any time and from time to time, and shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, not constitute the breach
by any Manager of this Agreement or of any duty (including any fiduciary duty)
hereunder or otherwise existing at law, in equity or otherwise.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement, in
no event may any Transfer of a Unit or other Company securities be made by any
Member or Assignee if the Board determines that:

  



  

(i) such Transfer is made to any Person who lacks the legal right,
power or capacity to own such Unit or other Company securities;

  



  

(ii) such Transfer would require the registration of such
transferred Unit or of any Class or series of Units or other Company
securities pursuant to any applicable U.S. federal or state securities laws
(including, without limitation, the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) or
other non-U.S. securities laws (including Canadian provincial or territorial
securities laws) or would constitute a non-exempt distribution pursuant to
applicable provincial or state securities laws;

  



  

(iii) such Transfer would cause (i) all or any portion of the assets
of the Company to (A) constitute "plan assets" (under ERISA, the Code or any
applicable Similar Law) of any existing or contemplated Member, or (B) be
subject to the provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or any
applicable Similar Law, or (ii) the Corporation, the Board or any Manager to
become a fiduciary with respect to any existing or contemplated Member,
pursuant to ERISA, any applicable Similar Law, or otherwise;

  



  

(iv) to the extent requested by the Board, the Company does not
receive such legal and/or tax opinions and written instruments
(including, without limitation, copies of any instruments of Transfer and any
instruments reflecting such Assignee's agreement to be bound by this
Agreement as an Assignee) that are in a form satisfactory to the Board, as
determined in the Board's sole discretion; _provided_ that no such legal
and/or tax opinions shall be required for a Transfer by a Principal
Stockholder; or

  



  

(v) the Board shall determine in its sole discretion that such
Transfer would pose a material risk that the Company would be treated as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(c) In addition, notwithstanding any contrary provision in this
Agreement, to the extent the Board shall determine in good faith
that additional restrictions on Transfers are necessary or advisable so that
the Company is not treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under Section
7704 of the Code, the Board may impose such additional restrictions on
Transfers as the Board has determined in good faith to be so necessary or
advisable; _provided_ that prior notice of such additional restrictions on
transfer is provided to all Members and Assignees.

  



  

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
Transfer in violation of this _Article VIII_ shall be deemed null and void
_ab initio_ and of no effect.

  



  

Section 8.07. _Rights of Assignees_. Subject to _Section 8.06(b)_, the
Transferee of any permitted Transfer pursuant to this _Article VIII _will be
an assignee only (" _Assignee_ "), and only will receive, to the extent
transferred, the distributions and allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, credit or similar item to which the Member which transferred its
Units would be entitled, and such Assignee will not be entitled or enabled to
exercise any other rights or powers of a Member, such other rights, and all
obligations relating to, or in connection with, such interest remaining with
the transferring Member. The transferring Member will remain a Member even if
it has transferred all of its Units to one or more Assignees until such time
as the Assignee(s) is admitted to the Company as a Member pursuant to
_Section 8.09_. Income, loss and other Company items shall be
allocated between the transferor and the Assignee according to Code Section
706 as determined by the Board.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

Section 8.08. _Admission of Assignees as Substitute Members_. An
Assignee will become a substitute Member only if and when each of the
following conditions is satisfied:

  



  

(a) the Board consents in writing to such admission, which consent
may be given or withheld, or made subject to such conditions as
are determined by the Board, in each case, in the Board's sole discretion;

  



  

(b) if required by the Board, the Board receives written
instruments (including, without limitation, copies of any instruments of
Transfer and an instrument evidencing such Assignee's agreement to be bound
by this Agreement as a substitute member of the Company) that are in a form
satisfactory to the Board (as determined in its sole discretion);

  



  

(c) if required by the Board, the Board receives an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to the Board to the effect that such Transfer is in
compliance with this Agreement and all applicable Laws; _provided_ that no
such opinion of counsel shall be required for a Transfer by a Principal
Stockholder; and

  



  

(d) if required by the Board, the parties to the Transfer, or any
one of them, pays all of the Company's reasonable expenses connected with
such Transfer (including, but not limited to, the reasonable legal and
accounting fees of the Company); _provided_ that no Principal Stockholder
shall be required to pay the Company's reasonable expenses connected with a
Transfer by such Principal Stockholder.

  



  

Section 8.09. _Resignation Members_. If a Member (other than the
Corporation) ceases to hold any Units, including as a result of a forfeiture
of Units pursuant to _Section 8.02_, then such Member shall cease to be a
Member and to have the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member of
the Company, and shall be deemed to have resigned from the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Act, unless
otherwise specifically agreed to by the Corporation, if the Corporation does
not hold or ceases to hold any Units, it shall remain a Member. Except as
otherwise provided in _Article IX_ or the Act, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, no admission, substitution, or resignation of a
Member will cause the dissolution of the Company. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any purported admission or resignation of a Member that is
not in accordance with this Agreement shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 8.10. _Applicability of Certain Provisions to the Principal
Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary, Sections
8.01, 8.02 and 8.06(a) are not applicable to any Units held by a Principal
Stockholder or in which a Principal Stockholder has an indirect interest as
set forth in the Schedule of Members.

series of Units immediately prior to such dissolution shall be preserved to
the greatest extent practicable with respect to distributions made to Members
pursuant to _Section 9.03_ in connection with the winding up of the Company,
taking into consideration tax and other legal constraints that may adversely
affect Members holding one or more Classes or series of Units and subject to
compliance with applicable Laws, unless, and to the extent that, with respect
to the Members holding any Class or series of Units, the Members holding
of not less than 90% of the Units of such Class or series consent in writing
to a treatment other than as described above.

  



  

Section 9.03. _Distribution upon Dissolution_. Upon dissolution, the
Company shall not be terminated and shall continue until the winding up
of the affairs of the Company is completed. Upon the winding up of the

Liquidation Agent determines otherwise, liquidate the assets of the
Company as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof.
During the winding up of the Company, the assets of the Company shall, except
as may be otherwise required by the Act, be applied and distributed in the

including the expenses of liquidation, and including the establishment of any
reserve which the Liquidation Agent shall deem reasonably necessary for any
contingent, conditional or unmatured contractual liabilities or obligations
of the Company (" _Contingencies_ "), which such reserve may be paid over by
the Liquidation Agent to any attorney-at-law, or acceptable party, as escrow
agent, to be held for disbursement in payment of any Contingencies and, at
the expiration of such period as shall be deemed advisable by the Liquidation
Agent for distribution of the balance in the manner hereinafter provided in
this _Section 9.03_; and

permitted by applicable Law, have no recourse against the Company or any
other Member or any other Person. No Member with a negative balance in such
Member's Capital Account shall have any obligation to the Company or to the
other Members or to any creditor or other Person to restore such negative
balance during the existence of the Company, upon dissolution or winding up of
the Company or otherwise, except to the extent required by the Act.

or liability of the Company or of any other Member or have any obligation to
restore any deficit balance in its Capital Account solely by reason of being
a Member, except to the extent required by the Act. No Manager shall be liable
for any debt, obligation or liability of the Company solely by reason of

their respective Affiliates. Further, notwithstanding anything otherwise to
the contrary in this Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or in
equity, no Member shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
have duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, any other Member or
any other Person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement;

a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement, any Member acting under
this Agreement shall not be liable to the Company, any other Member or any
other Person who is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement, for
such Member's good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 10.01_, to the extent that
they restrict or eliminate the duties (including fiduciary duties) and
liabilities relating thereto of any Member otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are agreed by the Company, the Members and any other Person who is a
party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement to replace such other duties
and liabilities of the Members relating thereto to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.02. _Duties, Liability and Outside Activities of the
Corporation, the Managers and Officers_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
Agreement or any duty otherwise existing at law or in equity, none of the

permitted by applicable Law, have duties (including fiduciary duties) to the
Company, any Member, any other Manager, any Officer, or any other Person that
is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Corporation and each Manager and Officer shall have the duty to act
in accordance with the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. In furtherance, but not in limitation, of the foregoing sentence,
whenever in this Agreement the Corporation, a Manager, or the Board
collectively, is permitted or required to make a decision in its "sole
discretion" or "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude,
the Corporation or such Manager or the Board, as applicable, shall be
entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires, including
its own interests or the interests of its stockholders or, in the case of the
Board or the Managers, the interests of the Corporation and the Corporation's
stockholders, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,

factors affecting the Company, any Member, any other Manager, any Officer, or
any other Person that is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary in this
Agreement to the extent that, at law or in equity, the Corporation, any
Manager or any Officer has liabilities relating thereto to the Company, any
Member or to any other Person who is a party to or is otherwise bound by this

this Agreement shall not be liable to the Company, any Member or any other
Person who is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement, for its good
faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

32

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Corporation, each Manager and each Officer shall be
fully protected relying in good faith upon the records of the Company and
upon information, opinions, reports or statements presented by any Member or
Manager, the Liquidation Agent, any Officer or any employee of the Company, or
by any other Persons as to matters the Corporation, such Manager or such
Officer reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or
expert competence, including information, opinions, reports or statements as
to the value and amount of the assets available for distribution to the
Members or creditors.

  



  

(d) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.02_, to the
extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties (including
fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto of the Corporation, the
Managers or any Officer otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the Company, the Members and any other Person that is a party to or is
otherwise bound by this Agreement, to replace such other duties and
liabilities of the Corporation, the Managers and any Officer relating thereto,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.03. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, as the same exists or hereafter be amended (but in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Company to provide broader indemnification rights than such Law permitted
the Company to provide prior to such amendment), the Company shall indemnify
any Indemnitee who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party to or
is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding (brought in the right of the Company or otherwise), whether civil,
criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative, and whether formal or
informal (hereinafter a " _Proceeding_ "), including appeals, by reason of his
or her or its status as an Indemnitee or by reason of any action alleged to
have been taken or omitted to be taken by Indemnitee in such capacity, for and
against all loss and liability suffered and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement reasonably
incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding, including appeals; _provided_ , that such Indemnitee shall not be
entitled to be indemnified hereunder to the extent that such Indemnitee's
conduct constituted fraud, willful misconduct or a bad faith violation of the
implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 10.03(c)_, the Company shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee
in connection with any Proceeding (or part thereof) (i) commenced by such
Indemnitee, only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by
such Indemnitee was authorized by the Board, and (ii) by or in the right of
the Company, only if the Board has provided its prior written consent. The
indemnification of an Indemnitee of the type identified in clause (d) of the
definition of Indemnitee shall be secondary to any and all indemnification to
which such Indemnitee is entitled from the relevant other Person (including
any payment made to such Indemnitee under any insurance policy issued to or
for the benefit of such Person or Indemnitee) (the " _Primary
Indemnification_ "), and shall only be required be paid to the extent the
Primary Indemnification is not paid and/or does not provide coverage (e.g., a
self-insured retention amount under an insurance policy). No such other
Person shall be entitled to contribution or indemnification from or
subrogation against the Company. The indemnification of any other Indemnitee
shall, to the extent not in conflict with such policy, be secondary to
any and all payment to which such Indemnitee is entitled from any relevant
insurance policy issued to or for the benefit of the Company or any
Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall not adversely
affect the indemnification and advancement rights provided pursuant to the
Existing Agreement in favor of any Person relating to Proceedings arising out
of actions or omissions occurring in whole or in part prior to the Effective
Date.

  



  

   

33

 



    



  

(b) _Advancement of Expenses_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Company shall promptly pay reasonable expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred by any Indemnitee in appearing at, participating in
or defending any Proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding, including appeals, upon presentation of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this
_Section 10.03_ or otherwise. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except
as otherwise provided in _Section 10.03(c)_, the Company shall be required
to pay expenses of an Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding (or part
thereof) (i) commenced by such Indemnitee, only if the commencement of such
Proceeding (or part thereof) by such Indemnitee was authorized by the
Board and (ii) by or in the right of the Company, only if the Board has
provided its prior written consent.

  



  

(c) _Unpaid Claims_. If a claim for indemnification (following
the final disposition of such Proceeding) or advancement of expenses, as
applicable, under this _Section 10.03_ is not paid in full within thirty (30)
days after a written claim therefor by any Indemnitee (and, if applicable, on
undertaking to repay) has been received by the Company, such Indemnitee may
file proceedings to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense
of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Company shall have the
burden of proving that such Indemnitee is not entitled to the requested
indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable Law.

  



  

(d) _Insurance_. (1) To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person described in _Section 10.03(a)_ against any liability asserted
against such person, whether or not the Company would have the power to
indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this
_Section 10.03_ or otherwise.

  



  

(i) In the event of any payment by the Company under this _Section
10.03_, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all
of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee from any relevant other Person or
under any insurance policy issued to or for the benefit of the Company, such
relevant other Person, or any Indemnitee. Each Indemnitee agrees to execute
all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the
Company to bring suit to enforce any such rights in accordance with the terms
of such insurance policy or other relevant document. The Company shall pay or
reimburse all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with such subrogation.

  



  

(ii) The Company shall not be liable under this _Section 10.03_ to
make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable under this _Section
10.03_ (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement, and excise taxes with respect to an employee benefit plan or
penalties) if and to the extent that the applicable Indemnitee has otherwise
actually received such payment under this _Section 10.03_ or any insurance
policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.

  



  

   

34

 



    



  

(e) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The provisions of this _Section
10.03 _shall be applicable to all Proceedings made or commenced after the
Effective Date, whether arising from acts or omissions to act occurring before
or after the Effective Date. The provisions of this _Section 10.03_ shall be
deemed to be a contract between the Company and each Indemnitee (or legal
representative thereof) who serves in such capacity at any time while this
_Section 10.03 _and the relevant provisions of applicable Law, if any, are
in effect, and any amendment, modification or repeal hereof shall not affect
any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts or
Proceeding then or theretofore existing, or any Proceeding thereafter brought
or threatened based in whole or in part on any such state of facts. If any
provision of this _Section 10.03_ shall be found to be invalid or limited in
application by reason of any law or regulation, it shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, not affect the validity of the remaining
provisions hereof. The rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided in this _Section 10.03_ shall neither be exclusive of, nor be
deemed in limitation of, any rights to which any Indemnitee may otherwise be
or become entitled or permitted by contract, this Agreement or as a matter of
Law, both as to actions in such Indemnitee's official capacity and actions in
any other capacity, it being the policy of the Company that
indemnification of and advancement of expenses of any Indemnitee shall be
made to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

For purposes of this _Section 10.03_, references to "other enterprises"
shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any
excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan;
and references to "serving at the request of the Company" shall include any
service as a director, Manager, officer, employee or agent of the Company
which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, Manager,
officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
participants, or beneficiaries.

  



  

This _Section 10.03_ shall not limit the right of the Company, to the extent
and in the manner permitted by applicable Law, to indemnify and to advance
expenses to, and purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of, persons other
than persons described in _Section 10.03(a)_.

merger, consolidation, combination or conversion of the Company; _provided_
that no amendment may materially and adversely affect the rights of a holder
of Units, as such, other than on a pro rata basis with other holders of Units
of the same Class without the consent of such holder (or, if there is more
than one such holder that is so affected, without the consent of a majority in
interest of such affected holders in accordance with their holdings of such
Class of Units); _provided further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Board may, without the written consent of any Member or any other Person,
amend, supplement, waive or modify any provision of this Agreement and

sole "manager" of the Company rather than by the Board; _provided further_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, including any amendment
effected by way of merger, consolidation or transfer of all or substantially
all the assets of the Company, may adversely affect the rights of (i) the BL
Investors without the consent of the BL Investors holding a majority of the

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder (other than a failure or delay beyond a
period of time specified herein) shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall

thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by applicable Law.

purposes) that is transferred is treated as being equal to the liquidation
value of that interest, (ii) an agreement by the Company and each of its
Members to comply with all of the requirements set forth in such

of services while the election remains effective, and (iii) the allocation of
items of income, gains, deductions and losses required by the final

notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement. The Board in its sole
discretion may from time to time execute and deliver to the Members schedules
which set forth information contained in the books and records of the Company
and any other matters deemed appropriate by the Board. Such schedules shall
be for information purposes only and shall not be deemed to be part of this
Agreement for any purpose whatsoever. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, this Agreement, the
Exchange Agreement, the Tax Receivable Agreements and any other separate
agreement described in this _Section 11.16 _shall constitute a
"partnership agreement" within the meaning of Section 706(c) of the Code.

written consent of the sole stockholder in accordance with Section 228 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Original Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in

Section 4.2. _Preferred Stock_.

  



  

(A) The Board of Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") is
hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions thereof, at any
time and from time to time, to provide, out of the unissued shares of
Preferred Stock, for one or more series of Preferred Stock and, with respect

the designation of such series, the powers (including voting powers), if any,
and the preferences and relative, participating, optional, special or other
rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof,
if any, of the shares of such series and to cause to be filed with the

respect thereto. The designations, powers (including voting powers),
preferences and relative, participating, optional, special or other rights of
each series of Preferred Stock, if any, and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from those of any and all other
series of Preferred Stock at any time outstanding.

of Class A Common Stock held of record by such holder on all matters on which
stockholders generally or holders of Class A Common Stock as a separate class
are entitled to vote (whether voting separately as a class or together with
one or more classes of the Corporation's capital stock); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, holders
of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall have no voting power with respect to,
and shall not be entitled to vote on, any amendment to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more
outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series
are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more
other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or pursuant to the DGCL.

(2) Each holder of record of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall
be entitled, without regard to the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
(or fraction thereof) held by such holder, to a number of votes that is equal
to the product of (x) the total number of Units (as defined in the Exchange
Agreement, dated on or about the date hereof, by and among the Corporation,
Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(" _FAEC LLC_ "), and the holders of Units (as defined therein) party thereto
(as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise modified from time to time,
the " _Exchange Agreement_ ")) held by such holder as set forth in the books
and records of FAEC LLC multiplied by (y) the Exchange Rate (as defined in
the Exchange Agreement), on all matters on which stockholders generally or
holders of Class B Common Stock as a separate class are entitled to vote
(whether voting separately as a class or together with one or more classes of
the Corporation's stock). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, holders of Class B Common Stock, as such,
shall have no voting power with respect to, and shall not be entitled to vote

solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if
the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or
together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon
pursuant to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or pursuant to the
DGCL.

  



  

(3) Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or required by applicable law, the holders of record of

record of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock are entitled to
vote together with the holders of record of Common Stock, as a single class,
together with the holders of record of such one or more series of Preferred
Stock) on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders generally.

  



  

(B) _Dividends and Distributions_. Subject to applicable law and
the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of
Preferred Stock or any other outstanding class or series of stock of the
Corporation, having a preference over or the right to participate with the
Class A Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and other
distributions in cash, property or shares of stock of the Corporation, the
holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be entitled to receive such
dividends and other distributions in cash, property or shares of stock of the
Corporation when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of the assets or funds of the Corporation that are by applicable law
available therefor. The holders of Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not
be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions in cash, property
or shares of stock of the Corporation.

  



  

(C) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up_. In the event of any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
affairs of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the
debts and other liabilities of the Corporation and subject to the right, if
any, of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock or any other
outstanding class or series of stock of the Corporation having a preference
over or the right to participate with the Class A Common Stock as to
distributions upon dissolution or liquidation or winding up of the
Corporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock, as such, shall be
entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock held by each such stockholder. The holders of
Class B Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to receive any assets of

holder of Class B Common Stock be transferred to the Corporation for no
consideration and thereupon shall be cancelled.

  



  

ARTICLE V

  



  

Section 5.1. _Bylaws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make,
amend, alter, change, add to or repeal, in whole or in part, the bylaws of
the Corporation (as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to
time, the " _Bylaws_ "). In addition to any affirmative vote required by the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of
at least a majority of the total voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together
as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders of the
Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part, any
provision of the Bylaws or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith.

  



  

ARTICLE VI

  



  

Section 6.1. _Board of Directors_.

  



  

(A) Except as otherwise provided in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board.

  



  

(B) Subject to the rights, if any, granted to the holders of any
one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock to elect one or more
directors (collectively, the " _Preferred Directors_ " and each a "
_Preferred Director_ ") and the rights granted pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement (as defined below), any newly-created directorship on the Board that
results from an increase in the total number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation,
disqualification, removal or other cause) shall be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors then in office (other than any
Preferred Director), although less than a quorum, or by the stockholders;
_provided_ that, at any time when the Principal Stockholders (as defined in
the Stockholders Agreement, dated on or about the date of the filing of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of the State of the
State of Delaware, by and among the Corporation and the stockholders of the
Corporation party hereto (as amended, supplemented, restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ") beneficially
own, in the aggregate, less than 30% of the total voting power of all the then
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in
the election of directors (a " _Voting Rights Threshold Period_ "),
any newly-created directorship on the Board that results from an increase in
the total number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board (whether
by death, resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause) shall be
filled solely and exclusively by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors then in office (other than any Preferred Director), although less
than a quorum. Any director so elected to fill a vacancy or newly created
directorship shall hold office until his or her successor shall be
elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation
disqualification or removal.

(C) Any or all of the directors (other than any Preferred
Directors) may be removed at any time either with or without cause by the
affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a
single class.

  



  

(D) During any period when the holders of any outstanding series
of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one
or more other outstanding series of Preferred Stock, have the right to elect
one or more Preferred Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, then upon commencement and for the duration of
the period during which such right continues: (i) the then otherwise total
authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be
increased by such specified number of Preferred Directors, and the holders of
such series of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to elect such Preferred
Director or Preferred Directors; and (ii) each such Preferred Director shall
serve until such director's successor shall have been duly elected and
qualified, or until such director's right to hold such office terminates
pursuant to said provisions, whichever occurs earlier, subject to his or her
earlier death, resignation, disqualification or removal. Except as otherwise
provided by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the holders of
any outstanding series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect one or
more Preferred Directors are divested of such right pursuant to the provisions
of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the terms of office of each
such Preferred Director elected by the holders of such series of
Preferred Stock, or elected to fill any vacancies resulting from the death,
resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall
forthwith terminate (in which case, each such director shall thereupon cease
to be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the total
authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall be automatically
reduced accordingly.

  



  

(E) Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
ballot unless the Bylaws shall so require.

  



  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

Section 7.1. _Meetings of Stockholders_. At any time during any Voting
Rights Threshold Period, any action required or permitted to be taken by the
holders of stock of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual
or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent by
such holders unless such action is recommended by all directors of the
Corporation then in office;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any action
required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Class B Common
Stock, voting separately as a class, or, to the extent expressly permitted by
the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to one
or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock, by the holders of such series
of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class
with one or more other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without
prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents, setting forth the
action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the
relevant class or series having not less than the minimum number of votes that
would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all
shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered
to the Corporation in accordance with the DGCL. Subject to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock and any rights granted
pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, special meetings of the stockholders
of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes may be called only by or at
the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that special meetings of
the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or purposes shall also be

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limited Liability of Directors_. No director of the
Corporation will have any personal liability to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or hereafter may be
amended. Neither the amendment modification, repeal nor elimination of this
Article VIII shall effect its application with respect to any act or
omission occurring before such amendment, modification, repeal or
elimination.

  



  

ARTICLE IX

  



  

Section 9.1. _Competition and Corporate Opportunities_.

  



  

(A) In recognition and anticipation that (i) members of the Board
who are not employees of the Corporation (" _Non-Employee Directors_ ") and
their respective Affiliates and Affiliated Entities (each, as defined below)
may now engage and may continue to engage in the same or similar activities
or related lines of business as those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that overlap with or
compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, may
engage and (ii) the Principal Stockholders and their respective Affiliates may
now engage and may continue to engage in the same or similar activities or
related lines of business as those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that overlap with or
compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
may engage, the provisions of this Article IX are set forth to regulate and
define the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with respect to
certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they may involve
any of the Non-Employee Directors, the Principal Stockholders or their
respective Affiliates and the powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the
Corporation and its directors, officers and stockholders in connection
therewith.

  



  

(B) None of (i) any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-
Employee Director who serves as an officer of the Corporation in both his or
her director and officer capacities) or his or her Affiliates or Affiliated
Entities or (ii) the Principal Stockholders or any of their respective
Affiliates (the Persons (as defined below) above being referred to,
collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and, individually, as an "
_Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1)
engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in
which the Corporation or any of its Affiliates now engages or proposes to
engage or (2) otherwise competing with the Corporation or any of its
Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
Identified Person shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or
to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty
solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person engages in any such
activities. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to be
offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may
be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and the Corporation or any
of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section 9.1(C) of this Article IX.
Subject to said Section 9.1(C) of this Article IX, in the event that any
Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other
business opportunity that may be a corporate opportunity for itself, herself
or himself and the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, such Identified
Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, have no duty
to communicate or offer such transaction or other business opportunity to the
Corporation or any of its Affiliates and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or
to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty as a
stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation solely by reason of the
fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires such corporate
opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or directs such
corporate opportunity to another Person or does not communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Article IX,
the Corporation does not renounce its interest in any corporate opportunity
offered to any Non-Employee Director (including any Non-Employee Director who
serves as an officer of the Corporation in both his or her director and
officer capacities) if such opportunity is expressly offered to such Non-
Employee Director solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
the Corporation, and the provisions of Section 9.1(B) of this Article IX shall
not apply to any such corporate opportunity.

  



  

(D) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Article IX, a potential corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be
a corporate opportunity of the Corporation if it is a business opportunity
that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor
contractually permitted, to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy.

  



  

(E) For purposes of this Article IX, (i) " _Affiliate_ " shall
mean (a) in respect of a Non-Employee Director, any Person (as defined below)
that, directly or indirectly, is controlled (as defined below) by such Non-
Employee Director (other than the Corporation and any Person that is
controlled by the Corporation), (b) in respect of any of the Principal
Stockholders, a Person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by any of
the Principal Stockholders, controls any of the Principal Stockholders or is
under common control with any of the Principal Stockholders and shall include
any principal, member, director, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or
other representative of any of the foregoing (other than the Corporation and
any entity that is controlled by the Corporation) and (c) in respect of the
Corporation, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by the
Corporation; (ii) " _Affiliated Entity_ " shall mean (a) any Person of which
a Non-Employee Director serves as an officer, director, employee, agent or
other representative (other than the Corporation and any Person that is
controlled by the Corporation), (b) any direct or indirect partner,
stockholder, member, manager or other representative of such Person or (c) any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing; and (iii) " _Person_ " shall mean any
individual, corporation, general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, association or any other entity.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

(F) For the purposes of this Article IX, " _control_ ," including
the terms " _controlling_ ," " _controlled by_ " and " _under common control
with_ ," means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through the ownership of voting stock, by contract, or otherwise. A Person
who is the owner of 20% or more in voting power of the outstanding voting
stock of a corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other
entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of
proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a presumption of control shall not apply where such person
holds voting stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing
this Section (F) of Article IX, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian
or trustee for one or more owners who do not individually or as a group have
control of such entity.

  



  

(G) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any Person
purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this Article IX.

  



  

ARTICLE X

  



  

Section 10.1. _DGCL Section 203 and Business Combinations_.

  



  

(A) The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by
Section 203 of the DGCL.

  



  

(B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall not
engage in any business combination (as defined below), at any point in time at
which shares of Class A Common Stock are registered under Section 12(b) or

Section 2.03 _Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_.

  



  

(A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors
by the stockholders generally entitled to vote (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall exclude nominations of one or more individuals elected by the
separate vote of the holders of any one or more series of preferred stock of
the Corporation) and the proposal of other business to be considered by the
stockholders generally entitled to vote (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude any question or business other than Nominations required by or
pursuant to the Restated Certificate with respect to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation to be
voted on by the holders of one or more such series, voting separately as a
single class) may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) as
provided in the Stockholders Agreement (as defined in the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation) (with respect to nominations of persons for election to the
Board of Directors only), (b) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting
(or any supplement thereto) delivered pursuant to _Section 2.04_ of _Article
II_ of these Bylaws, (c) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or
any authorized committee thereof or (d) by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting, who, subject to paragraph
(C)(4) of this _Section 2.03_, complied with the notice procedures set forth
in paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this _Section 2.03_ and who was a
stockholder of record at the time such notice is delivered to the Secretary
of the Corporation.

  



  

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (d) of paragraph (A)(1)
of this _Section 2.03_, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation, and, in the case of business
other than nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors,
such other business must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less
than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior
to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (which
date shall, for purposes of the Corporation's first annual meeting of
stockholders after its shares of Common Stock (as defined in the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation) are first publicly traded, be deemed to have
occurred on June 1 of the preceding calendar year); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more
than thirty (30) days, or delayed by more than seventy (70) days, from the
anniversary date of the previous year's meeting, or if no annual meeting was
held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and
twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such
annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement (as defined below) of the date of such meeting is first made by
the Corporation. Public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an
annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice. The number of nominees a
stockholder may nominate for election at the annual meeting (or in the case
of a stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the number
of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the annual meeting on
behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of directors to
be elected at such annual meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
2.03(A)(2)_ to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the
Board of Directors at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public
announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or
specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least one hundred
(100) calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the prior year's annual
meeting of stockholders, then a stockholder's notice required by this
_Section 2.03_ shall be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees
for any new positions created by such increase, if it is received by the
Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth
(10th) calendar day following the day on which such public announcement is
first made by the Corporation.

stockholder and to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other
business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief

reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest
in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on
whose behalf the proposal is made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice
and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal
is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the
Corporation's books and records, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class

the notice, will be entitled to vote at such meeting and will appear in
person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or
nomination, (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial
owner, if any, will be or is part of a group that will (x) deliver a proxy
statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the
voting power of the Corporation's outstanding shares of stock required to
approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (y) otherwise
solicit proxies or votes from stockholders in support of such proposal or
nomination, (v) a certification regarding whether such stockholder and
beneficial owner, if any, have complied with all applicable federal, state
and other legal requirements in connection with the stockholder's and/or
beneficial owner's acquisition of shares of stock or other securities of the
Corporation and/or the stockholder's and/or beneficial owner's acts or
omissions as a stockholder of the Corporation and (vi) any other information
relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal
and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and

regulations promulgated thereunder; (d) a description of any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal
and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation between or among the stockholder giving the notice,
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made, any of their respective affiliates or associates and/or any others
acting in concert with any of the foregoing (collectively, " _proponent
persons_ "); and (e) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including without limitation any contract to purchase or sell,
acquisition or grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell,
swap or other instrument) to which any proponent person is a party, the
intent or effect of which may be (i) to transfer to or from any proponent
person, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of
any security of the Corporation, (ii) to increase or decrease the voting power
of any proponent person with respect to shares of any class or series of
stock of the Corporation and/or (iii) to provide any proponent
person, directly or indirectly, with the opportunity to profit or share in
any profit derived from, or to otherwise benefit economically from, any
increase or decrease in the value of any security of the Corporation. A
stockholder providing notice of a proposed nomination for election to the
Board of Directors or other business proposed to be brought before a meeting
(whether given pursuant to this paragraph (A)(3) or paragraph (B) of this
_Section 2.03 _of these Bylaws) shall update and supplement such notice from
time to time to the extent necessary so that the information provided or
required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct (x) as of
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting and (y) as of the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof, _provided_ that if the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is less
than fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the information shall be supplemented and updated as of
such later date. Any such update and supplement shall be delivered in writing
to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than five (5) days after the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting (in the case
of any update and supplement required to be made as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting), not later
than ten (10) days prior to the date for the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof (in the case of any update or supplement required to be
made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or adjournment or
postponement thereof) and not later than five (5) days after the record date
for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, but no
later than the day prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof (in the case of any update and supplement required to be made as of a

adjournment or postponement thereof). The Corporation may require any
proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably
require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a
director of the Corporation and to determine the independence of such
director under the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder and
applicable stock exchange rules.

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business
(including the election of specific individuals to fill vacancies or newly
created directorships on the Board of Directors) shall be conducted at a
special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting
pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. At any time that stockholders
are not prohibited from filling vacancies or newly created directorships on
the Board of Directors, nominations of persons for the election to the Board
of Directors to fill any vacancy or unfilled newly created directorship may
be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which any proposal to fill
any vacancy or unfilled newly created directorship is to be presented to the
stockholders (1) as provided in the Stockholders Agreement, (2) by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or (3) by any
stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting on such
matters, who (subject to paragraph (C)(4) of this _Section 2.03_) complies
with the notice procedures set forth in paragraphs (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this
_Section 2.03_ and who is a stockholder of record at the time such notice is
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. The number of nominees a
stockholder may nominate for election at the special meeting (or in the case
of a stockholder giving the notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the
number of nominees a stockholder may nominate for election at the special
meeting on behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of
directors to be elected at such special meeting. In the event the Corporation
calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of submitting a
proposal to stockholders for the election of one or more directors to fill
any vacancy or newly created directorship on the Board of Directors, any such
stockholder entitled to vote on such matter may nominate a person or persons
(as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the
Corporation's notice of meeting if the stockholder's notice as required by
paragraph (A)(2) of this _Section 2.03_ shall be delivered to the Secretary
at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the
close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such
special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which the Corporation first makes a public announcement
of the date of the special at which directors are to be elected. In no event
shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special
meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving
of a stockholder's notice as described above.

the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or

shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason)
to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations
and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman,

meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or
business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business
shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote
may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this _Section
2.03_, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a
person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such
stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder
or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for
such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must

of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with
respect to the matters set forth in this _Section 2.03_;  _provided_ ,

of this  _Section 2.03_ of these Bylaws shall be the exclusive means for a
stockholder to make nominations or submit other business. Nothing in these

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

effect with respect to the Principal Stockholders, the Principal Stockholders
(to the extent then subject to the Stockholders Agreement) shall not be
subject to the notice procedures set forth in paragraphs (A)(2), (A)(3) or (B)
of this _Section 2.03_ with respect to any annual or special meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

Section 2.04 _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are
required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a notice of the
meeting in the form of a writing or by electronic transmission shall be given
in the manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL, which shall state the
place, if any, date and time of the meeting, the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting, the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is
different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by
applicable law, the notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law,
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which the Corporation's securities are listed, the
holders of record of a majority of the voting power of the issued and
outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at all meetings of stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is
required, a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of such class
or series or classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to the vote on
that matter. Once a quorum is present to organize a meeting, it shall not be
broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided by or pursuant
to the provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each
stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders shall be
entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder
that has voting power upon the matters in question. Each stockholder entitled
to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent to corporate
action without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
such stockholder by proxy in any manner provided under Section 212(c) of the
DGCL or as otherwise provided under applicable law, but no such proxy shall
be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that
it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke
any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in
person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of
the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. Unless determined by the
chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the stockholder vote on any question
need not be by written ballot. On a vote by written ballot, each ballot shall
be signed by the stockholder voting, or by such stockholder's proxy, if there
be such proxy. When a quorum is present or represented at any meeting of
stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote on the subject matter shall decide any question brought before such
meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of
applicable law, of the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable
to the Corporation, of any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its
securities, of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence and subject to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all
elections of directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes
cast in respect of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at
the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.

business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting that might have been
transacted at the meeting originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a
new record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote

written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event

stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more
inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon
the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute

Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may

Corporation to stockholders entitled to such uncertificated shares. The
Corporation may adopt a system of issuance, recordation and transfer of its
shares of stock by electronic or other means not involving the issuance of
certificates, _provided_ that the use of such system by the Corporation is
permitted by applicable law.

  



  

Section 5.03 _Transfer of Shares_. Subject to any restriction on
the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock of the
Corporation or on the amount of securities that may be owned by any person or
a group of persons imposed by the Restated Certificate, the Bylaws or by an
agreement among any number of security holders or among such holders and the
Corporation, shares of stock of the Corporation shall be transferable upon
its books by the holders thereof, in person or by their duly authorized
attorneys or legal representatives, upon surrender to the Corporation by
delivery thereof (to the extent evidenced by a physical stock certificate) to
the person in charge of the stock and transfer books and ledgers. Certificates
representing such shares, if any, shall be cancelled and new certificates, if
the shares are to be certificated, shall thereupon be issued. Subject to any
restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock of
the Corporation or on the amount of securities that may be owned by any
person or a group of persons imposed by the Restated Certificate, the Bylaws
or by an agreement among any number of security holders or among such holders
and the Corporation shares of stock of the Corporation that are not
represented by a certificate shall be transferred in accordance with any
procedures adopted by the Corporation or its agents and applicable law. A
record shall be made of each transfer. Whenever any transfer of shares shall
be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, it shall be so
expressed in the entry of the transfer if, when the certificates are
presented to the Corporation for transfer or uncertificated shares requested
to be transferred, both the transferor and transferee request the Corporation
do so. The Corporation shall have power and authority to make such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary or proper concerning the issue, transfer
and registration of certificates representing shares of stock of the
Corporation and uncertificated shares.

Section 5.04 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutilated Certificates_. A
new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares may be issued in the place
of any certificate previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may, in its discretion,

legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond, in such sum as the
Corporation may direct, in order to indemnify the Corporation against any
claims that may be made against it on account of the alleged, loss, theft or
destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate
or uncertificated shares. A new certificate or uncertificated shares of stock
may be issued in the place of any certificate previously issued by the
Corporation that has become mutilated upon the surrender by such owner of such
mutilated certificate and, if required by the Corporation, the posting of a
bond by such owner in an amount sufficient to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against on account of the alleged, loss,
theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new

Section 5.05 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The

of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting ( _provided_ , _however_ , if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of
the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of
the tenth (10th) day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the
number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall
be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (a) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network; _provided_ that the information required to
gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (b) during
ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the
time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be
examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as
otherwise provided by the applicable law, the stock ledger shall be the only
evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of
stockholders required by this _Section 5.05 _or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

Section 5.06 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of
Record_.

  



  

(A) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof,
the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty
(60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the
Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless
the Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date,
that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any
adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the
record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the
same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

  



  

(B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders
entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of
any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days
prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating thereto.

  



  

(C) Unless otherwise restricted by the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in order that the Corporation may determine the
stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be
more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date for
determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
without a meeting is fixed by the Board of Directors, (i) when no prior
action of the Board of Directors is required by the DGCL, the record date for
such purpose shall be the first date on which a signed consent setting forth
the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in
accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by the DGCL, the record date for such purpose shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  



  

Section 5.07 _Registered Stockholders_. Prior to the surrender to
the Corporation of the certificate or certificates for a share or shares
of stock or notification to the Corporation of the transfer of uncertificated
shares with a request to record the transfer of such share or shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner of such share or shares as the
person entitled to receive dividends, to vote, to receive notifications and
otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner of such share or
shares. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest
in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it
shall have express or other notice thereof.

ARTICLE VI

  



  

Notice and Waiver of Notice

  



  

Section 6.01 _Notice_. Notice is deemed given (i) if mailed, when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the
Corporation, (ii) if delivered by courier service, the earlier of when the
notice is received or left at such stockholder's address as it appears on the
records of the Corporation, (iii) if by facsimile telecommunication, when
directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice, (iv) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail
address unless the stockholder has notified the Corporation in writing or by
electronic transmission of an objection to receiving notice by electronic mail
or such notice is prohibited by the DGCL, and (v) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder as required by
applicable law and, to the extent required by applicable law, in the manner
consented to by that stockholder. Without limiting the manner by which notice
otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders
may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232
of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 6.02 _Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any notice,
signed by a stockholder or director entitled to notice, or waiver by
electronic transmission by such person, whether given before or after the
time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent
to the notice required to be given to such person. Neither the business nor
the purpose of any meeting need be specified in such a waiver. Attendance at
any meeting (in person or by remote communication) shall constitute waiver of
notice except attendance for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

  



  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

Indemnification and Advancement

  



  

Section 7.01 _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is
made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise
involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason
of the fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the
Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee,
agent or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such
proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law,
as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
indemnitee in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as
provided in _Section 7.03_ with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification or advancement of expenses or with respect to any compulsory
counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the Corporation shall indemnify any
such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized
by the Board of Directors.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

Any reference to an officer of the Corporation in this _Article VII_ shall
be deemed to refer exclusively to the Chief Executive Officer, President,
Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Secretary of the Corporation
appointed pursuant to _Article IV_ of these Bylaws, and to any Vice
President, Assistant Secretary, Assistant Treasurer or other officer of the
Corporation appointed by the Board of Directors pursuant to _Article IV_ of
these Bylaws, and any reference to an officer of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
shall be deemed to refer exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of
directors or equivalent governing body of such other entity pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise. The fact that any person who is or
was an employee of the Corporation or an employee of any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise,
but not an officer thereof as described in the preceding sentence, has been
given or has used the title of "Vice President" or any other title that could
be construed to suggest or imply that such person is or may be such an
officer of the Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall not result in
such person being constituted as, or being deemed to be, such an officer of
the Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for purposes of this
_Article VII_.

  



  

Section 7.02 _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. In addition to the
right to indemnification conferred in _Section 7.01_, an indemnitee shall
also have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including
attorney's fees) incurred in appearing at, participating in or defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition or in connection with a
proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this _Article VII _(which shall be governed by
_Section 7.03_ (hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, if the DGCL requires or in the case of an advance made in a
proceeding brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or
advancement, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made solely upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an
" _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial
decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "
_final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified or entitled to advancement of expenses under _Sections 7.01_ and
_7.02_ or otherwise.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 7.03 _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under
_Section 7.01_ or _7.02_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within (i)
sixty (60) days after a written claim for indemnification has been received by
the Corporation or (ii) twenty (20) days after a claim for an advancement of
expenses has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time
thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of
the claim or to obtain advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware law, if the indemnitee is successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a
defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made
a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including by its directors who are not
parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal
counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not
met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought
by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this _Article VII _or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

  



  



  

Section 7.04 _Indemnification Not Exclusive_.

  



  

(A) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of
expenses and costs to any indemnitee under this _Article VII_, or the
entitlement of any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses
and costs under this _Article VII_, shall not limit or restrict in any way
the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to
such indemnitee in any other way permitted by Delaware law or be deemed
exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which any indemnitee
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled
under any Delaware law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in such indemnitee's capacity as an
officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as to action in
any other capacity.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(B) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined
below) may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director
and/or officer of the Corporation and as a director, officer, employee or
agent of one or more indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, be fully
and primarily responsible for the payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses in connection with any such jointly
indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
_Article VII_, irrespective of any right of recovery the indemnitee may have
from any indemnitee-related entity. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to
any right of subrogation or contribution by any indemnitee-related entity and
no right of advancement or recovery the indemnitee may have from any
indemnitee-related entity shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the
indemnitee or the obligations of the Corporation hereunder. In the event that
any indemnitee-related entity shall make any payment to the indemnitee in
respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any
jointly indemnifiable claim, such indemnitee-related entity shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be subrogated to the extent of
such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the
Corporation, and the indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required
and shall do all lawful things that may be reasonably necessary to secure
such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be necessary to
enable any indemnitee-related entity effectively to bring suit to enforce such
rights. Each of the indemnitee-related entities shall be third-party
beneficiaries with respect to this _Section 7.04(B)_, entitled to enforce
this _Section 7.04(B)_.

  



  

For purposes of this _Section 7.04(B)_, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

  



  

(1) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any
other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has
agreed, on behalf of the Corporation or at the Corporation's request, to
serve as a director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered
by the indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation (other than as a result of obligations under an insurance policy).

  



  

(2) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly
construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or
proceeding for which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses from both an indemnitee-related entity and the
Corporation pursuant to Delaware law, any agreement or certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or comparable
organizational documents of the Corporation or an indemnitee-related entity,
as applicable.

  



  

Section 7.05 _Nature of Rights_. The rights conferred upon
indemnitees in this _Article VII _shall be contract rights and such rights
shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and
administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this _Article VII_
that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be
prospective only and shall not limit, eliminate, or impair any such
right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
amendment or repeal.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

Section 7.06 _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such
person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7.07 _Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the
Corporation_. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this _Article VII_ with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.

ARTICLE II

  



  

SECTION 2.1. _Exchange of LLC Units for Class A Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) (i) Subject to adjustment as provided in this _Article II_
and to the provisions of the LLC Agreement, each LLC Unitholder shall be
entitled, on any Quarterly Exchange Date, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, to surrender LLC Units to Finance of America Equity
Capital LLC, for the account of either the Corporation or Finance of America
Equity Capital LLC, in exchange for the delivery to the exchanging LLC
Unitholder of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock that is equal to the
product of the number of LLC Units surrendered multiplied by the Exchange
Rate (such exchange, an " _Exchange_ "). (ii) In addition, subject to
adjustment as provided in this _Article II_, each Principal Stockholder shall
be entitled, at any time from and after the closing of the Equity
Transactions, to Exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock;
_provided_ , that the number of LLC Units surrendered in Exchanges pursuant
to this clause (ii) during any thirty (30) calendar day period represent, in
the aggregate, greater than two percent of total interests in partnership
capital or profits ( _provided_ that such Exchange constitutes a "block
transfer" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 1.7704-1(e)(2)).
Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary, each LLC Unitholder shall
be entitled, at any time from and after the closing of the
Equity Transactions to Exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A Common Stock
in connection with the settlement of LTIP Awards pursuant to the Amended and
Restated UFG Holdings LLC Management Long-Term Incentive Plan and the LTIP

SECTION 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) The Corporation will provide notice thereof to each LLC
Unitholder eligible to Exchange LLC Units on a Quarterly Exchange Date at
least seventy-five (75) days prior to the anticipated date of such Quarterly
Exchange Date. An LLC Unitholder shall exercise its right to make an Exchange
as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ above by providing a written notice of
Exchange, which in the case of an Exchange pursuant to clause (i) of _Section
2.1(a)_ shall be delivered, at least sixty (60) days prior to the applicable
Quarterly Exchange Date substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto and incorporated herein by reference, duly executed by such holder or
such holder's duly authorized attorney, in each case delivered during normal
business hours at the principal executive offices of the Corporation and to
Finance of America Equity Capital LLC.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the surrender for
Exchange of the LLC Units in the manner provided in this _Article
II_, Finance of America Equity Capital LLC shall deliver or cause to be
delivered at the offices of the then-acting registrar and transfer agent of
the Class A Common Stock or, if there is no then-acting registrar and transfer
agent of the Class A Common Stock, at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable upon
such Exchange registered in the name of the relevant exchanging LLC
Unitholder. To the extent the Class A Common Stock is settled through the
facilities of The Depository Trust Company, Finance of America Equity Capital
LLC will, subject to _Section 2.2(c)_ below, upon the written instruction of
an exchanging LLC Unitholder, use its reasonable best efforts to deliver the
shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable to such exchanging LLC Unitholder,
through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, to the account of the
participant of The Depository Trust Company designated by such exchanging LLC
Unitholder. The Corporation, including in its capacity as the Managing Member
of Finance of America Equity Capital LLC, shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, take such actions as may be required to ensure
the performance by Finance of America Equity Capital LLC of its
obligations under this _Article II_, including the issuance and sale of
shares of Class A Common Stock to or for the account of Finance of America
Equity Capital LLC in exchange for the delivery to the Corporation of a number
of LLC Units that is equal to the number of LLC Units surrendered by an
exchanging LLC Unitholder.

  



  

(c) Finance of America Equity Capital LLC and each Exchanging LLC
Unitholder shall bear their own expenses in connection with the
consummation of any Exchange, whether or not any such Exchange is ultimately
consummated, except that Finance of America Equity Capital LLC shall bear any
transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar taxes in connection
with, or arising by reason of, any Exchange;  _provided_ , however, that if
any shares of Class A Common Stock are to be delivered in a name other than
that of the LLC Unitholder that requested the Exchange, then such LLC
Unitholder and/or the Person in whose name such shares are to be
delivered shall pay to Finance of America Equity Capital LLC the amount of
any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or other similar taxes in
connection with, or arising by reason of, such Exchange or shall establish to
the reasonable satisfaction of Finance of America Equity Capital LLC that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) The Corporation may adopt reasonable procedures for the
implementation of the Exchange provisions set forth in this _Article II_; 
_provided_ that, without the consent of each Principal Stockholder, the
Corporation shall not adopt any procedures inconsistent with or that impair
or adversely affect the rights of a Principal Stockholder to Exchange LLC
Units pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_. An LLC Unitholder may not revoke a
notice of exchange relating to an Exchange pursuant to clause (i) of _Section
2.1(a)_ delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_, without the express written
consent of the Corporation, which consent may be provided or withheld, or
made subject to such conditions, limitations or restrictions, as determined by
the Corporation in its sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, such
determinations by the Corporation need not be uniform and may be made
selectively among LLC Unitholders, whether or not such LLC Unitholders are
similarly situated.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Corporation may, in its sole discretion, elect to settle any Exchange
hereunder by delivering shares of Class A Common Stock directly to an
exchanging LLC Unitholder in exchange for such LLC Unitholder's surrender to
the Corporation of the corresponding LLC Units. Any such transaction shall
otherwise be effected on the terms and in the manner provided herein and
shall constitute an "Exchange" for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent
an LLC Unitholder surrenders for exchange a fraction of an LLC Unit, Finance
of America Equity Capital LLC may in its sole discretion deliver to such
holder a cash amount equal to the fair market value of such fraction (as
determined by Finance of America Equity Capital LLC in its sole discretion) in
lieu of delivering a fraction of a share of Class A Common Stock.

  



  

SECTION 2.3. _Limitations on Exchanges_.

  



  

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, an LLC Unitholder shall not be entitled to Exchange LLC
Units to the extent the Corporation determines, in good faith, that such
Exchange (i) would be prohibited by applicable law or (ii) would result in
any breach of any debt agreement or other material contract of Finance of
America Equity Capital LLC or the Corporation; _provided_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed to limit the rights and remedies of any LLC
Unitholder pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, no Exchange shall be deemed to be prohibited by applicable law
pertaining to the registration of securities if such securities have been so
registered or if any exemption from such registration requirements is
reasonably available.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the board
of directors of the Corporation shall determine, in good faith, that
additional restrictions on Exchange are necessary so that Finance of America
Equity Capital LLC is not treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under
Section 7704 of the Code, the Corporation or Finance of America Equity Capital
LLC may impose such additional restrictions on Exchanges as the board of
directors of the Corporation has determined, in good faith, to be so
necessary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Exchange shall
be permitted if, in the good faith determination of the Corporation or Finance
of America Equity Capital LLC, such an Exchange would pose a material risk
that Finance of America Equity Capital LLC would be a "publicly traded
partnership" under Section 7704 of the Code.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

SECTION 2.4. _Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted if there is: (i) any
subdivision (by any forward unit split, unit distribution,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the LLC Units that is not accompanied by an
identical subdivision (by any forward stock split, stock dividend or
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the Class A Common Stock; or (ii) any
subdivision (by any forward stock split, stock dividend or distribution,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the Class A Common Stock that is not
accompanied by an identical subdivision (by any forward unit split, unit
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the LLC Units, in each
case, to the extent necessary to maintain the economic equivalency in the
value surrendered for exchange and the value received, as determined by the
Corporation in its sole discretion. If there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the
Class A Common Stock is converted or changed into another security, securities
or other property, then upon any subsequent Exchange, an exchanging LLC
Unitholder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such security,
securities or other property that such exchanging LLC Unitholder would have
received if such Exchange had occurred immediately prior to the effective
date of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other
similar transaction with respect to the Class A Common Stock, taking into
account any adjustment as a result of any subdivision (by any forward split,
distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of such
security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective
time of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other
similar transaction. Except as may be required in the immediately preceding
sentence, no adjustments in respect of dividends or distributions on the LLC
Units or shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, subject to such
Exchange shall be made upon the Exchange of any LLC Unit.

  



  

SECTION 2.5. _Class A Common Stock to be Issued._

  



  

(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the
purpose of issuance upon an Exchange, such number of shares of Class A Common
Stock as shall be deliverable upon any such Exchange; _provided_ that nothing
contained herein shall be construed to preclude Finance of America Equity
Capital LLC from satisfying its obligations in respect of the Exchange of the
LLC Units by delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock which are held in the
treasury of the Corporation or held by Finance of America Equity Capital LLC
or any of their subsidiaries or by delivery of purchased shares of Class A
Common Stock (which may or may not be held in the treasury of the
Corporation or held by any subsidiary thereof). The Corporation and Finance
of America Equity Capital LLC covenant that all Class A Common Stock issued
upon an Exchange will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable.

  



  

(b) The Corporation and Finance of America Equity Capital LLC
covenant and agree that, to the extent that a registration statement
under the Securities Act is effective and available for shares of Class A
Common Stock to be delivered with respect to any Exchange, shares of Class A
Common Stock that have been registered under the Securities Act shall be
delivered in respect of such Exchange. In the event that any Exchange in
accordance with this Agreement is to be effected at a time when any required
registration of shares of Class A Common Stock has not become effective or
otherwise is unavailable, upon the request and with the
reasonable cooperation of the LLC Unitholder requesting such Exchange, the
Corporation and Finance of America Equity Capital LLC shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly facilitate such Exchange pursuant to any
reasonably available exemption from such registration requirements. The
Corporation and Finance of America Equity Capital LLC shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to list the shares of Class A Common Stock required to be
delivered upon Exchange prior to such delivery upon each national securities
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system upon which the outstanding shares
of Class A Common Stock may be listed or traded at the time of such delivery.

ARTICLE III

  



  

SECTION 3.1. _Additional LLC Unitholders_ . To the extent an LLC
Unitholder validly transfers any or all of such holder's LLC Units to
another person in a transaction in accordance with, and not in contravention
of, the LLC Agreement or any other agreement or agreements with the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to which a transferring LLC Unitholder
may be party, then such transferee (each, a " _Permitted Transferee_ ") shall
have the right to execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached hereto and incorporated
herein by reference, whereupon such Permitted Transferee shall become an LLC
Unitholder hereunder. To the extent Finance of America Equity Capital LLC
issues LLC Units after the date of this Agreement, Finance of America Equity
Capital LLC shall be entitled, in its sole discretion, to make any holder of
such LLC Units an LLC Unitholder hereunder through such holder's execution
and delivery of a joinder to this Agreement, substantially in the form of
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 3.8. _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably with
respect to this Agreement, including any action (at law or in equity),
claim, litigation, suit, arbitration, hearing, audit, review, inquiry,

exclusively in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, or, if such court
shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts shall have jurisdiction, any other
Delaware state court. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
of the parties hereby (i) irrevocably submits with regard to any such dispute
for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the sole and exclusive personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any dispute arising out of, relating to or in
connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation,
performance or non-performance of this Agreement or a written notice of
Exchange or any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
a written notice of Exchange and the rights and obligations arising hereunder

dispute in any of the aforesaid courts by the mailing of copies thereof by
registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by recognized overnight
delivery service, to such party at such party's address referred to in
_Section 3.2_, and (iii) irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such dispute,
(A) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this _Section 3.8_, (B) any claim that it or its property is
exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), or (C) any objection which such party

Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts.

  



  

(b) To the extent that any party has or hereafter may acquire any
immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself, or to
such party's property, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each

(c) Each party acknowledges that it is knowingly and voluntarily
agreeing to the choice of Delaware law to govern this agreement and
any written notice of Exchange and to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts in

an effective choice of Delaware law and an effective consent to jurisdiction
and service of process under 6 del. C. § 2708.

  



  

(d) Each party, for itself and its affiliates, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, all right to trial by jury in any action or counterclaim
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, relating to or
in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation,
performance or non-performance of this Agreement or a written notice of
Exchange or any matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
a written notice of Exchange and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
or thereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgement in
respect of this Agreement or a written notice of Exchange and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder or thereunder.

  



  

SECTION 3.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format
data file) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement. Copies of executed counterparts transmitted by
telecopy, by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file or other electronic
transmission service shall be considered original executed counterparts for
purposes of this _Section 3.9_.

  



  

SECTION 3.10. _Tax Treatment_ _; Tax Withholding_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be treated as part of the partnership
agreement of Finance of America Equity Capital LLC as described in Section
761(c) of the Code and Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c) of the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. As required by the Code and the
Treasury Regulations, the parties shall report any Exchange consummated
hereunder as a taxable sale of the LLC Units by an LLC Unitholder to the
Corporation, and no party shall take a contrary position on any income tax
return, amendment thereof or communication with a taxing authority unless an
alternate position is permitted under the Code and Treasury Regulations and
the Corporation consents in writing.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the
Corporation, Finance of America Equity Capital LLC and their agents and
affiliates shall have the right to deduct and withhold taxes (including,
without limitation, shares of Class A Common Stock with a fair market value,
determined in the sole discretion of the Corporation, equal to the amount of
such taxes) from any payments (including payments made by the delivery of
shares of Class A Common Stock or other payments in kind) to be made pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if, in their
determination, such withholding is required by applicable law, and an
exchanging LLC Unitholder or other recipient of payment hereunder shall
provide the Corporation, Finance of American Equity Capital LLC or any Person
making a payment pursuant to this Agreement, tax forms, including Form W-9 or
the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, and any similar
information which may be requested by the payor; _provided_ , that the
Corporation may, in its sole discretion, allow an exchanging LLC Unitholder
to pay such taxes owed on the exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class
A Common Stock in cash in lieu of the Corporation withholding or deducting
such taxes. To the extent that any of the aforementioned amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the recipient of the payments
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent
that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by such deductions
or withholdings, such recipient shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, indemnify the applicable withholding agent for any amounts
imposed by any taxing authority together with any costs and expenses related
thereto.

SECTION 3.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be entitled to specific
performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

SECTION 3.12. _Independent Nature of LLC Unitholders ' Rights and
Obligations_. The obligations of each LLC Unitholder hereunder are several
and not joint with the obligations of any other LLC Unitholder, and no LLC
Unitholder shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the
obligations of any other LLC Unitholder hereunder. The decision of each LLC
Unitholder to enter into to this Agreement has been made by such LLC
Unitholder independently of any other LLC Unitholder. Nothing contained
herein, and no action taken by any LLC Unitholder pursuant hereto, shall be
deemed to constitute the LLC Unitholders as a partnership, an association, a
joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the
LLC Unitholders are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect
to such obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby and the
Corporation acknowledges that the LLC Unitholders are not acting in concert
or as a group, and the Corporation will not assert any such claim, with
respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

SECTION 3.13. _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regards to its principles of conflicts of laws.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

Article I

  



  

 _DEFINITIONS_

  



  

Section 1.1. _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement, the terms set
forth in this Article I shall have the following meanings (such meanings to be
equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms
defined).

  



  

" _Actual Tax Liability_ " means the sum of (i) the actual liability for
Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer as reported on its IRS Form 1120 (or
any successor form) for a given Taxable Year and (ii) the product of the
actual amount of the United States federal taxable income for such taxable
year reported on the Corporate Taxpayer's IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) and the Blended Rate.

  



  

" _Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that
directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, Controls, is
Controlled by, or is under common Control with, such first Person.

2

 



    



  

" _Amended Schedule_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 2.3(b) of this
Agreement.

  



  

" _Attributable_ " means the portion of any Tax Attribute of the Corporate
Taxpayer that is "Attributable" to any present or former holder of Units,
other than the Corporate Taxpayer, as the case may be, and shall be determined
by reference to the Tax Attributes, under the following principles:

  



  

(i) any Transaction Basis Adjustments (other than any Transaction
Basis Adjustments attributable to the Pre-Closing Distribution) shall be
determined separately with respect to each Transaction Exchange and are
Attributable to a Transaction Exchange Unit Holder based on the Transaction
Basis Adjustment delivered to the Corporate Taxpayer by such Transaction
Exchange Unit Holder in the Transaction Exchange;

  



  

(ii) any Basis Adjustments shall be determined separately with
respect to each Exchanging Holder and are Attributable to each
Exchanging Holder in an amount equal to the total Basis Adjustments relating
to such Units Exchanged by such Exchanging Holder; and

  



  

(iii) any deduction to the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to a
Taxable Year in respect of Imputed Interest is Attributable to the
Person that is required to include the Imputed Interest in income (without
regard to whether such Person is actually subject to Tax thereon).

  



  

" _Basis Adjustment_ " means the adjustment to the Tax basis of a Reference
Asset under Sections 732, 734(b) and/or 1012 of the Code (in
situations where, as a result of one or more Exchanges, FOA OpCo becomes an
entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for United States
federal income Tax purposes) or under Sections 734(b), 743(b) and/or 754 of
the Code (in situations where, following an Exchange, FOA OpCo remains in
existence as an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal
income Tax purposes) and, in each case, analogous sections of United States
state and local Tax laws, as a result of an Exchange and the payments
made pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Exchange. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Basis Adjustment resulting from an
Exchange of one or more Units shall be determined without regard to any Pre-
Exchange Transfer of such Units and as if any such Pre-Exchange Transfer had
not occurred. The amount of any Basis Adjustment shall be determined using the
Market Value at the time of the Exchange.

  



  

" _Basis Schedule_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 2.1 of this
Agreement.

  



  

" _Beneficial Owner_ " means, with respect to any security, a Person who
directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding,
relationship or otherwise, has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes
the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such security; and/or (ii)
investment power, which includes the power to dispose of, or to direct the
disposition of, such security.  The terms " _Beneficially Own_ " and "
_Beneficial Ownership_ " shall have correlative meanings.

  



  

   

3

PubCo, the Blackstone Investors, and any other parties thereto, dated as of
[●], 202[●].

  



  

" _Blended Rate_ " means, with respect to any Taxable Year, the sum of the
effective rates of Tax imposed on the aggregate net income of the
Corporate Taxpayer in each state or local jurisdiction in which the Corporate
Taxpayer files Tax Returns for such Taxable Year, with the maximum effective
rate in any state or local jurisdiction being equal to the product of (i) the
apportionment factor on the income or franchise Corporate Taxpayer Return in
such jurisdiction for such Taxable Year and (ii) the maximum
applicable corporate Tax rate in effect in such jurisdiction in such Taxable
Year. As an illustration of the calculation of Blended Rate for a Taxable
Year, if the Corporate Taxpayer solely files Tax Returns in State 1 and State
2 in a Taxable Year, the maximum applicable corporate Tax rates in effect in
such states in such Taxable Year are 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively, and the
apportionment factors for such states in such Taxable Year are 55% and 45%
respectively, then the Blended Rate for such Taxable Year is equal to
6.05% (i.e., 6.5% multiplied by 55% plus 5.5% multiplied by 45%).

Act of 1934, as amended or any successor provisions thereto (excluding (a) a
corporation or other entity owned, directly or indirectly, by the

the Corporate Taxpayer representing more than 50% of the combined voting

the ultimate parent thereof; or

  



  

(iv) the stockholders of the Corporate Taxpayer approve a plan of
complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporate Taxpayer or there is
consummated an agreement or series of related agreements for the sale, lease
or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by the Corporate Taxpayer of

sale or other disposition by the Corporate Taxpayer of all or substantially
all of the Corporate Taxpayer's assets to an entity at least 50% of the
combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by
stockholders of the Corporate Taxpayer in substantially the same proportions
as their ownership of the Corporate Taxpayer immediately prior to such sale.

virtue of the consummation of any transaction or series of integrated

transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership
in, and voting control over, and own substantially all of the shares of, an

Article II

  



  

 _DETERMINATION OF CERTAIN REALIZED TAX BENEFIT_

  



  

Section 2.1. _Basis Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after
the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form)
of the Corporate Taxpayer for each relevant Taxable Year, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall deliver to each TRA Party a schedule (the " _Basis Schedule_

calculations required by this Agreement, (i) the Transaction Basis Adjustment
with respect to the Reference Assets in respect of such TRA Party as a result
of the Transaction Exchanges, if any, calculated in the aggregate, (ii) the
Non-Stepped Up Transaction Basis of the Reference Assets in respect of such
TRA Party as of the date of the Transaction Exchanges, if any, (iii) the Non-
Stepped Up Tax Basis of the Reference Assets in respect of such TRA Party as
of each applicable Exchange Date, if any, (iv) the Basis Adjustment with
respect to the Reference Assets in respect of such TRA Party as a result of
the Exchanges effected in such Taxable Year or any prior Taxable Year by such
TRA Party, if any, calculated in the aggregate, (v) the period (or
periods) over which the Reference Assets in respect of such TRA Party are
amortizable and/or depreciable and (vi) the period (or periods) over which
each Transaction Basis Adjustment, and each Basis Adjustment in respect of
such TRA Party is amortizable and/or depreciable. All costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the provision and preparation of the Basis
Schedules and Tax Benefit Schedules for each TRA Party in compliance with
this Agreement shall be borne by FOA OpCo.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

Section 2.2. _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days
after the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for any Taxable Year in which there is a
Realized Tax Benefit or a Realized Tax Detriment Attributable to a TRA Party,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide to such TRA Party a schedule showing, in
reasonable detail, the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit and Tax
Benefit Payment, or the Realized Tax Detriment, as applicable, in respect of
such TRA Party for such Taxable Year (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ "). Each Tax
Benefit Schedule will become final as provided in Section 2.3(a) and may be
amended as provided in Section 2.3(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in
Section 2.3(b)).

  



  

(b) _Applicable Principles_.

  



  

(i) _General_. Subject to Section 3.3, the Realized Tax Benefit
(or the Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable Year is intended to
measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Taxes of the
Corporate Taxpayer for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Attributes,
determined using a "with and without" methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of
any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered to
be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or
the appropriate provisions of United States state and local income and
franchise Tax law, as applicable, governing the use, limitation and
expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or
carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax
Attribute and another portion that is not, such portions shall be considered
to be used in accordance with the "with and without" methodology. The parties
agree that (A) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon)
attributable to the Basis Adjustments will be treated as subsequent upward
purchase price adjustments that have the effect of creating additional Basis
Adjustments to Reference Assets for the Corporate Taxpayer in the year of
payment, (B) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon)
attributable to the Transaction Basis Adjustments will be treated
as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments that have the effect of
creating additional Transaction Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the
Corporate Taxpayer in the year of payment, (C) as a result, such additional
Basis Adjustments and Transaction Basis Adjustments will be incorporated into
the current year calculation and into future year calculations, as
appropriate, and (D) the Actual Tax Liability will take into account the
deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted
for as Imputed Interest.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

(ii) _Applicable Principles of Section 734(b) Exchanges_.
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Agreement, the
foregoing treatment set out in Section 2.3(b)(i) shall not be required to
apply to payments hereunder to a TRA Party in respect of a Section 734(b)
Exchange by such TRA Party. For the avoidance of doubt, payments made under
this Agreement relating to a Section 734(b) Exchange shall not be treated as
resulting in a Transaction Basis Adjustment or Basis Adjustment to the extent
such payments are treated as Imputed Interest. The parties intend that (A) a
TRA Party that has made a Section 734(b) Exchange shall, with respect to the
Transaction Basis Adjustment or Basis Adjustment resulting from such Section
734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such Section 734(b)
Exchange, be entitled to Tax Benefit Payments attributable to such
Transaction Basis Adjustments or Basis Adjustments only to the extent such
Transaction Basis Adjustments or Basis Adjustments are allocable to the
Corporate Taxpayer following such Section 734(b) Exchange (without taking into
account any concurrent or subsequent Exchanges) and (B) if, as a result of a
subsequent Exchange, an increased portion of the Basis Adjustments resulting
from such Section 734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such
Section 734(b) Exchange becomes allocable to the Corporate Taxpayer, then the
LLC Unit Holder that makes such subsequent Exchange shall be entitled to a
Tax Benefit Payment calculated in respect of such increased portion.

  



  

Section 2.3. _Procedures, Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a
TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this Agreement, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early Termination
Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
also (x) deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and work papers, as
determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA
Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were
relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule and (y) allow such TRA Party
reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate representatives at the
Corporate Taxpayer, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably
requested by such TRA Party, in connection with a review of such Schedule.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule that is delivered to a
TRA Party, along with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a
reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax
Liability and the Hypothetical Tax Liability and identifies any material
assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes
of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall
become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the
date on which all relevant TRA Parties are treated as having received the
applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA
Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days from such date
provides the Corporate Taxpayer with written notice of a material objection
to such Schedule (" _Objection Notice_ ") made in good faith or (ii)
provides a written waiver of such right of any Objection Notice within the
period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or
amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the
Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues
raised in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt
by the Corporate Taxpayer of an Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and
the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures as
described in Section 7.9 of this Agreement (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_
"). The TRA Party Representative will fairly represent the interests of each
of the TRA Parties and shall use reasonable efforts to timely raise and
pursue, in accordance with this Section 2.3(a), any reasonable objection to
a Schedule or amendment thereto timely communicated in writing to the TRA
Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable
Year may be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i)
in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct
material inaccuracies in the Schedule identified as a result of the receipt
of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date
the Schedule was provided to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with an Expert's
determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change
in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable
Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other Tax item
to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or
the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended
Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust an applicable TRA
Party's Basis Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to this
Agreement (any such Schedule, an " _Amended Schedule_ "). The Corporate
Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule to each TRA Party when the
Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis Schedule for the following taxable
year.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 3.1. _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Payments_. Within five (5) calendar days after a Tax Benefit
Schedule delivered to a TRA Party becomes final in accordance with Section
2.3(a) and Section 7.9, if applicable, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay such
TRA Party for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant
to Section 3.1(b) that is Attributable to the relevant TRA Party. Each such
Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account previously designated by such TRA Party to
the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
such TRA Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) no Tax Benefit Payment shall
be made in respect of estimated Tax payments, including, without limitation,
United States federal estimated income Tax payments and (y) the payments
provided for pursuant to the above sentence shall be computed separately for
each TRA Party. The Corporation and the TRA Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of any
Transaction Exchange or any future Exchange that may be subject to this
Agreement, the aggregate value of the Tax Benefit Payments cannot be
reasonably ascertained for U.S. federal income or other applicable tax
purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
respect to each Transaction Exchange or Exchange by or with respect to any TRA
Party, if such TRA Party notifies the Corporate Taxpayer in writing of a
stated maximum selling price (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
15A.453-1(c)(2)) to be applied with respect to such Transaction Exchange or
Exchange, the amount of the initial consideration received in connection with
such Transaction Exchange or Exchange and the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments
to such TRA Party in respect of such Transaction Exchange or Exchange (other
than amounts accounted for as interest under the Code) shall not exceed such
stated maximum selling price.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

(b) A  " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party for a
Taxable Year means an amount, not less than zero, equal to the Net Tax
Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Party and the Interest Amount with
respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, the Interest
Amount shall not be treated as interest, but instead, shall be treated as
additional consideration in the applicable transaction, unless otherwise
required by law. Subject to Section 3.3, the " _Net Tax Benefit_ " for a
Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any, of 85% of the
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year, over
the total amount of payments previously made under the first sentence
of Section 3.1(a) (excluding payments attributable to Interest Amounts);
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no such recipient shall be
required to return any portion of any previously made Tax Benefit Payment. The
" _Interest Amount_ " shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit
calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions) for
filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with
respect to Taxes for such Taxable Year until the payment date under Section
3.1(a).

  



  

Section 3.2. _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the
provisions of this Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of any
amount (including interest) required under this Agreement or the Blackstone
Investors TRA. The provisions of this Agreement and the Blackstone Investors
TRA shall be construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such intentions are
realized.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Pro Rata Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in Section
3.1 to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax Benefit of
the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to the Tax Attributes is limited in a
particular Taxable Year because the Corporate Taxpayer does not have
sufficient taxable income, the Net Tax Benefit for the Corporate Taxpayer and
the "Net Tax Benefit" of the Corporate Taxpayer under the Blackstone
Investors TRA shall be allocated among all parties eligible for Tax Benefit
Payments under this Agreement and all parties eligible for "Tax Benefit
Payments" under the Blackstone Investors TRA in proportion to the amounts of
Net Tax Benefit, as such term is defined in this Agreement and the Blackstone
Investors TRA, as applicable, that would have been Attributable to each such
party if the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient taxable income so that there
were no such limitation.

  



  

Section 3.4. _Payment Ordering_. If for any reason the Corporate
Taxpayer does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all
Tax Benefit Payments due under this Agreement or any "Tax Benefit Payment"
due under the Blackstone Investors TRA in respect of a particular Taxable
Year, then the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree that (i) Tax
Benefit Payments for such Taxable Year shall be allocated to all parties
eligible for Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement or the Blackstone
Investors TRA in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit as such term is
defined in this Agreement and the Blackstone Investors TRA, as applicable,
that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if the Corporate Taxpayer
had sufficient cash available to make such Tax Benefit Payments and (ii) no
Tax Benefit Payments shall be made in respect of any Taxable Year under
either the Blackstone Investors TRA or this Agreement until all Tax Benefit
Payments to all TRA Parties and all "TRA Parties" under the Blackstone
Investors TRA in respect of all prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

Article IV

  



  

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 4.1. _Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement_.

  



  

(a) The Corporate Taxpayer may terminate this Agreement with
respect to all amounts payable to the TRA Parties and with respect to all of
the Units held by the TRA Parties at any time by paying to each TRA Party the
Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Agreement shall only terminate upon the receipt of the
Early Termination Payment by all TRA Parties, and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Corporate Taxpayer may withdraw any notice to execute its
termination rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior to the time at which any
Early Termination Payment has been paid.  Upon payment of the Early
Termination Payment by the Corporate Taxpayer, none of the TRA Parties or the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have any further payment obligations under this
Agreement, other than for any (a) Tax Benefit Payments due and payable
and that remain unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and (b) Tax Benefit
Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of the
Early Termination Notice (except to the extent that the amount described in
clause (b) is included in the Early Termination Payment). If an Exchange
occurs after the Corporate Taxpayer makes all of the required Early
Termination Payments, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under
this Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer (1) breaches any of
its material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure
to make any payment when due, failure to honor any other material obligation
required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of
this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise or
(2)(A) shall commence any case, proceeding or other action (i) under any
existing or future law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of debtors, seeking to have
an order for relief entered with respect to it, or seeking to adjudicate a
bankruptcy or insolvency, or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or other relief with
respect to it or its debts or (ii) seeking an appointment of a receiver,
trustee, custodian, conservator or other similar official for it or for all
or any substantial part of its assets, or it shall make a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors or (B) there shall be commenced against the
Corporate Taxpayer any case, proceeding or other action of the nature
referred to in clause (A) above that remains undismissed or undischarged for a
period of sixty (60) calendar days, all obligations hereunder shall be
automatically accelerated and shall be immediately due and payable, and such
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such breach and shall include, but not be limited
to, (1) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if an Early Termination
Notice had been delivered on the date of a breach, (2) any Tax Benefit
Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of a breach,
and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of a breach; provided that
procedures similar to the procedures of Section 4.2 shall apply with respect
to the determination of the amount payable by the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant
to this sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing (other than as set forth in
subsection (2) above), in the event that the Corporate Taxpayer breaches this
Agreement, each TRA Party shall be entitled to elect to receive the amounts
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above or to seek specific
performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that the failure to make
any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three (3) months of the
date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a breach of a material
obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, and that
it will not be considered to be a breach of a material obligation under this
Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three (3)
months of the date such payment is due. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a breach of a material obligation
of this Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer fails to make any Tax Benefit
Payment or payment made with respect to Section 4.1(c) when due to the
extent that the Corporate Taxpayer has insufficient funds to make such
payment; _provided_ , that the interest provisions of Section 5.2 shall apply
to such late payment (unless the Corporate Taxpayer does not have sufficient
funds to make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by any Senior
Obligations, in which case Section 5.2 shall apply, but the Default Rate shall
be replaced by the Agreed Rate).

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(c) In the event of a Change of Control, all obligations hereunder
shall be accelerated and such obligations shall be calculated as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such Change of Control
and utilizing the Valuation Assumptions by substituting in each case the
terms "the closing date of a Change of Control" in each place where the phrase
"Early Termination Date" appears. Such obligations shall include, but not be
limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if the Early
Termination Date is the date of such Change of Control, (2) any Tax Benefit
Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of such Change
of Control, and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due
for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including the date of such
Change of Control (except to the extent that any amounts described in clause
(2) or (3) are included in the Early Termination Payments). For the avoidance
of doubt, Sections 4.2 and 4.3 shall apply to a Change of Control, _mutadis
mutandi._

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (1) if the
Corporate Taxpayer terminates the Blackstone Investors TRA, it shall be
required to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.1(a), (2) any
breach, proceeding or action that results in an acceleration of the
Blackstone Investors TRA shall be treated as a breach, proceeding or action
that results in an acceleration of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.1(b),
(3) any "Change of Control" for purposes of the Blackstone Investors TRA
shall also be treated as a Change of Control for purposes of this Agreement,
and (4) without limiting the foregoing, this Section 4.1 shall be applied
consistently to this Agreement and the Blackstone Investors TRA.

  



  

Section 4.2. _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate Taxpayer
chooses to exercise its right of early termination under Section 4.1 above,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to each TRA Party notice of such
intention to exercise such right (" _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a
schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") specifying the Corporate
Taxpayer's intention to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail
the calculation of the Early Termination Payment(s) due for each TRA Party.
Each Early Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on all parties
thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which all TRA Parties are
treated as having received such Schedule or amendment thereto under Section
7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days
after such date provides the Corporate Taxpayer with notice of a material
objection to such Schedule made in good faith (" _Material Objection Notice_
") or (ii) provides a written waiver of such right of a Material Objection
Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which case such
Schedule becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the Corporate
Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any
reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of
the Material Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures in which case such
Schedule becomes binding ten (10) calendar days after the conclusion of the
Reconciliation Procedures. The TRA Party Representative will fairly represent
the interests of each of the TRA Parties and shall timely raise and pursue,
in accordance with this Section 4.2, any reasonable objection to an Early
Termination Schedule or amendment thereto timely communicated in writing to
the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

Section 4.3. _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within three (3) calendar days after an Early Termination
Effective Date, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Party an amount
equal to the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party. Such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account or accounts designated by such TRA Party or as otherwise agreed
by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Party or, in the absence of such
designation or agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing address provided
by such TRA Party to the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

(b) " _Early Termination Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party
shall equal the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
the applicable Early Termination Effective Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments
in respect of such TRA Party that would be required to be paid by the
Corporate Taxpayer beginning from the Early Termination Date and assuming that
the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such TRA Party are applied and that
each Tax Benefit Payment for the relevant Taxable Year would be due and
payable on the due date (without extensions) under applicable law as of the
Early Termination Effective Date for filing of IRS Form 1120 (or any
successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

Article V

  



  

 _SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 5.1. _Subordination_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment or payments made with
respect to Section 4.1(c) required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to
the TRA Parties under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in
right of payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
in respect of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money
of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (" _Senior Obligations_ ") and
shall rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all current or future
unsecured obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior
Obligations (including the Blackstone Investors TRA). To the extent that any
payment under this Agreement is not permitted to be made at the time payment
is due as a result of this Section 5.1 and the terms of agreements
governing Senior Obligations, such payment obligation nevertheless shall
accrue for the benefit of TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall make
such payments at the first opportunity that such payments are permitted to be
made in accordance with the terms of the Senior Obligations. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the
Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates enters into future Tax receivable
or other similar agreements (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include the Blackstone Investors TRA) (" _Future TRAs_ "), the Corporate
Taxpayer shall ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA shall provide
that the Tax Attributes subject to this Agreement are considered senior
in priority to any Tax attributes subject to any such Future TRA for purposes
of calculating the amount and timing of payments under any such Future TRA.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 5.2. _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. Subject to the
proviso in the last sentence of Section 4.1(b), the amount of all or any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to
the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this Agreement, whether as a
result of Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall be payable together with any
interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate and commencing from the date
on which such Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment was first due
and payable to the date of actual payment.

  



  

Article VI

  



  

 _NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION_

  



  

Section 6.1. _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer 's and FOA OpCo's
Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided herein, and except as provided in
the LLC Agreement, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have full responsibility for,
and sole discretion over, all Tax matters concerning the Corporate Taxpayer
and FOA OpCo, including, without limitation, the preparation, filing or
amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any issue
pertaining to Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall notify the TRA Party Representative of, and keep the TRA Party
Representative reasonably informed with respect to, the portion of any audit
of the Corporate Taxpayer and FOA OpCo by a Taxing Authority the outcome of
which is reasonably expected to materially affect the rights and obligations
of a TRA Party under this Agreement, and shall provide to the TRA Party
Representative reasonable opportunity to provide information and other input
to the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo and their respective advisors concerning
the conduct of any such portion of such audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Corporate Taxpayer and FOA OpCo shall not be required to take any action
that is inconsistent with any provision of the LLC Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.2. _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties
agree to report and cause to be reported for all purposes, including United
States federal, state and local Tax purposes and financial reporting
purposes, all Tax-related items (including, without limitation, the
Transaction Basis Adjustments, Basis Adjustments and each Tax Benefit Payment)
in a manner consistent with that contemplated by this Agreement or specified
by the Corporate Taxpayer in any Schedule required to be provided by or on
behalf of the Corporate Taxpayer under this Agreement unless otherwise
required by law. The Corporate Taxpayer shall (and shall cause FOA OpCo and
its other Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts (for the
avoidance of doubt, taking into account the interests and entitlements of all
TRA Parties under this Agreement) to defend the Tax treatment contemplated by
this Agreement and any Schedule in any audit, contest or similar proceeding
with any Taxing Authority.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

Section 6.3. _Cooperation_. Each of the TRA Parties shall (a) furnish
to the Corporate Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and
other materials as the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes
of making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate under
this Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any audit,
examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request in
connection with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter, and the Corporate
Taxpayer shall reimburse each such TRA Party for any reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 6.3. Upon
the request of any TRA Party, the Corporate Taxpayer shall cooperate in
taking any action reasonably requested by such TRA Party in connection with
its tax or financial reporting and/or the consummation of any assignment or
transfer of any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement,
including without limitation, providing any information or executing any
documentation.

Section 7.2. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood
that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed
signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.3. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.4. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York.

  



  

Section 7.5. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 7.6. _Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Each TRA Party may assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to any Person as long as such transferee has
executed and delivered, or, in connection with such transfer, executes and
delivers, a joinder to this Agreement, substantially in form of _Exhibit A_
hereto, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all purposes of this Agreement,
except as otherwise provided in such joinder.

  



  

(b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such
amendment is approved in writing by each of the Corporate Taxpayer and by the
TRA Parties who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the total
amount of the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties hereunder
if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the
date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for
purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to
this Agreement since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided_ , that
no such amendment shall be effective if such amendment will have a
disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA Parties receive under
this Agreement unless such amendment is consented in writing by such TRA
Parties disproportionately affected who would be entitled to receive at
least two-thirds of the total amount of the Early Termination Payments
payable to all TRA Parties disproportionately affected hereunder if the
Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the date of
the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of
this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to this Agreement
since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided further_ , that no
such amendment may adversely affect the BL Investors unless such amendment is
consented in writing by the BL Investors. No provision of this Agreement may
be waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party against
whom the waiver is to be effective. Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the
contrary, if the TRA Representative and the TRA Representative under the
Blackstone Investors TRA shall jointly propose an amendment to this
Agreement and to the Blackstone Investors TRA that is necessary or
appropriate in order to ensure that the respective rights and obligations of
the TRA Parties under this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
Blackstone Investors under the Blackstone Investors TRA are equal and ratable
in all material respects as though they were all party to the same agreement,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to such
amendment, whereupon such amendment will become effective without the
consent of any other party provided that no such amendment shall have a
material adverse effect on the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer shall
require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place.

  



  

Section 7.7. _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are
not to be considered in construing this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.8. _Resolution of Disputes_.

  



  

(a) Any and all disputes which are not governed by Section 7.9 and
cannot be settled amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation,
execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration
provision) (each a  " _Dispute_ ") shall be finally settled by arbitration
conducted by a single arbitrator in New York in accordance with the then-
existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the
parties to the Dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within
thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the request for arbitration,
the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The
arbitrator shall be a lawyer admitted to the practice of law in the State of
New York and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language.
Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during
any arbitration proceedings.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the Corporate
Taxpayer may bring an action or special proceeding in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking
temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or
enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b),
each TRA Party (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of
this Section 7.8 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that
proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the
provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that
remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the
Corporate Taxpayer as agent of such TRA Party for service of process in
connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of
process upon such agent, who shall promptly advise the TRA Party of any such
service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon the TRA Party in any such action or proceeding.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(c) (i) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS Section 7.8, OR
ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED
ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such
ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to
compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid
of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge
that the fora designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to
this Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one another; and

  



  

(ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may have
to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary
suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in the preceding
paragraph of this Section 7.8 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the
same.

  



  

Section 7.9. _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer
and the TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with
respect to the matters governed by Sections 2.3 and 4.2 within the relevant
period designated in this Agreement (" _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the
Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally
recognized expert (the  " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement
mutually acceptable to both parties. The Expert shall be a partner or
principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and unless the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative agree otherwise, the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with the Corporate Taxpayer or the TRA Party
Representative or other actual or potential conflict of interest. If the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to agree on an
Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of
written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the Expert shall be appointed
by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert
shall resolve any matter relating to the TRA Party's Basis Schedule or an
amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto
within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a
Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days
or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the
matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is
the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such
disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is
due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this
Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate
Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and
expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax
Return shall be borne by the Corporate Taxpayer except as provided in the
next sentence. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall
bear their own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert
adopts the TRA Party Representative's position, in which case the Corporate
Taxpayer shall reimburse the TRA Party Representative for any reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts
the Corporate Taxpayer's position, in which case the TRA Party Representative
shall reimburse the Corporate Taxpayer for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses in such proceeding.  Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a
Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 7.9 shall be decided
by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute
and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be
binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA Parties and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

Section 7.10. _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.
To the extent that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by
such deductions or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify the applicable
withholding agent for any amounts imposed by any Taxing Authority together
with any costs and expenses related thereto. Each TRA Party shall promptly
provide the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo or other applicable withholding
agent with any applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form
W-9 or the applicable version of IRS Form W-8) reasonably requested, in
connection with determining whether any such deductions and withholdings are
required under the Code or any provision of United States state, local or
foreign Tax law.

  



  

Section 7.11. _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated
Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer is or becomes a member of an
affiliated or consolidated group of corporations that files a
consolidated income Tax Return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code
or any corresponding provisions of state or local law, then: (i)
the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group
as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments, Early Termination Payments and
other applicable items hereunder shall be computed with reference to the
consolidated taxable income of the group as a whole.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(b) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) transfers or is deemed to transfer any Unit or any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the
property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause
such transferee to assume the obligation to make payments hereunder with
respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any Reference Asset
or interest therein acquired (directly or indirectly) in such transfer (taking
into account any gain recognized in the transaction) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement as the transferee (or one of its Affiliates)
actually realizes Tax benefits from the Tax Attributes. If FOA OpCo transfers
(or is deemed to transfer for United States federal income Tax purposes) any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the
property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, FOA OpCo shall be treated as having
disposed of the Reference Asset in a wholly taxable transaction. The
consideration deemed to be received by FOA OpCo in a transaction contemplated
in the prior sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed
transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject,
in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.
If any member of a group described in Section 7.11(a) that owns any Unit
deconsolidates from the group (or the Corporate Taxpayer deconsolidates from
the group), then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause such member (or the parent
of the consolidated group in a case where the Corporate Taxpayer
deconsolidates from the group) to assume the obligation to make payments
hereunder with respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any
Reference Asset it owns (directly or indirectly) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement as the member (or one of its Affiliates)
actually realizes Tax benefits. If a transferee or a member of a group
described in Section 7.11(a) assumes an obligation to make payments hereunder
pursuant to either of the foregoing sentences, then the initial obligor is
relieved of the obligation assumed.

  



  

(c) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States
federal income Tax purposes) any Unit in a transaction that is wholly or
partially taxable, then for purposes of calculating payments under this
Agreement, FOA OpCo shall be treated as having disposed of the portion of any
Reference Asset that is indirectly transferred by the Corporate Taxpayer (
_i.e._ , taking into account the number of Units transferred) in a wholly or
partially taxable transaction in which all income, gain or loss is allocated
to the Corporate Taxpayer. The consideration deemed to be received by FOA
OpCo shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed transferred asset,
plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the case of a
transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to such
asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.

  



  

Section 7.12. _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the last sentence of Section 6.3, each TRA Party
and each of their assignees acknowledge and agree that the information of the
Corporate Taxpayer is confidential and, except in the course of performing any
duties as necessary for the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates, as
required by law or legal process or to enforce the terms of this Agreement,
such person shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not
disclose to any Person any confidential matters, acquired pursuant to this
Agreement, of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors,
concerning FOA OpCo and its Affiliates and successors or the Members, learned
by the TRA Party heretofore or hereafter. This Section 7.12 shall not apply
to (i) any information that has been made publicly available by the Corporate
Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a
result of an act of the TRA Party in violation of this Agreement) or is
generally known to the business community and (ii) the disclosure of
information to the extent necessary for the TRA Party to prepare and file its
Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the same from any Taxing
Authority or to prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any
Taxing Authority with respect to such returns. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, each TRA Party and each of their assignees (and each
employee, representative or other agent of the TRA Party or its assignees, as
applicable) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo
and their Affiliates, and any of their transactions, and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA
Party relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(b) If a TRA Party or an assignee commits a breach, or threatens
to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 7.12, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of
this Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by
any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other
security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach shall cause irreparable injury to the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its
Subsidiaries or the TRA Parties and the accounts and funds managed by the
Corporate Taxpayer and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate
remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 7.13. _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if, in connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a TRA
Party reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause
income (other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this
Agreement) recognized by the TRA Party upon any Exchange by such TRA Party to
be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at
ordinary income rates) for United States federal income Tax purposes or
would have other material adverse Tax consequences to such TRA Party, then at
the election of such TRA Party and to the extent specified by such TRA Party,
this Agreement (i) shall cease to have further effect with respect to such TRA
Party, (ii) shall not apply to an Exchange by such TRA Party occurring after
a date specified by such TRA Party, or (iii) shall otherwise be amended in a
manner determined by such TRA Party, provided that such amendment shall not
result in an increase in payments under this Agreement at any time as
compared to the amounts and times of payments that would have been due in the
absence of such amendment.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

Section 7.14. _TRA Party Representative_. By executing this Agreement,
each of the TRA Parties shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted the
TRA Party Representative as his, her or its agent and attorney in fact with
full power of substitution to act from and after the date hereof and to do
any and all things and execute any and all documents on behalf of such TRA
Parties which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate any
matters under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) execution of
the documents and certificates required pursuant to this Agreement; (ii)
except to the extent specifically provided in this Agreement receipt and
forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement; (iv)
administration of the provisions of this Agreement; (v) any and all consents,
waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the TRA Party
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and the execution or delivery of
any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith;
(vi) amending this Agreement or any of the instruments to be delivered to the
Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to this Agreement; (vii) taking actions the TRA
Party Representative is expressly authorized to take pursuant to the other
provisions of this Agreement; (viii) negotiating and compromising, on behalf
of such TRA Parties, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or
refraining from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby and executing, on behalf of such TRA
Parties, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to
such dispute or remedy; and (ix) engaging attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of such TRA Parties in connection with this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees related thereto.
The TRA Party Representative may resign upon thirty (30) days' written notice
to the Corporate Taxpayer. All reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the TRA Party Representative in its capacity as such
shall be promptly reimbursed by the Corporate Taxpayer upon invoice and
reasonable support therefor by the TRA Party Representative. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, none of the TRA Party Representative, any of its
Affiliates, or any of the TRA Party Representative's or Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees or other agents (each a " _Covered Person_ ")
shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to any
TRA Party, FOA OpCo or the Corporate Taxpayer for damages arising from any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the TRA Party Representative or any
other Person with respect to FOA OpCo or the Corporate Taxpayer, except in
the case of any action or omission which constitutes, with respect to such
Person, willful misconduct or fraud. Each of the Covered Persons may consult
with legal counsel, accountants, and other experts selected by it, and any
act or omission suffered or taken by it on behalf of FOA OpCo or the Corporate
Taxpayer or in furtherance of the interests of FOA OpCo or the Corporate
Taxpayer in good faith in reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of
such counsel, accountants, or other experts shall create a rebuttable
presumption of the good faith and due care of such Covered Person with respect
to such act or omission; _provided_ , that such counsel, accountants, or
other experts were selected with reasonable care. Each of the Covered Persons
may rely in good faith upon, and shall have no liability to FOA OpCo, the
Corporate Taxpayer or the TRA Parties for acting or refraining from acting
upon, any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper party or parties.

Attributable to a Transaction Exchange Unit Holder based on the Transaction
Basis Adjustment delivered to the Corporate Taxpayer by such Transaction
Exchange Unit Holder in the Transaction Exchange;

  



  

(v) any Basis Adjustments shall be determined separately with
respect to each Exchanging Holder and are Attributable to each
Exchanging Holder in an amount equal to the total Basis Adjustments relating
to such Units Exchanged by such Exchanging Holder; and

  



  

(vi) any deduction to the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to a

 | 3|

entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for United States
federal income Tax purposes) or under Sections 734(b), 743(b) and/or 754 of
the Code (in situations where, following an Exchange, FOA OpCo remains in
existence as an entity treated as a partnership for United States federal
income Tax purposes) and, in each case, analogous sections of United States
state and local Tax laws, as a result of an Exchange and the payments
made pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Exchange. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Basis Adjustment resulting from an
Exchange of one or more Units shall be determined without regard to any Pre-
Exchange Transfer of such Units and as if any such Pre-Exchange Transfer had
not occurred. The amount of any Basis Adjustment shall be determined using the
Market Value at the time of the Exchange.

" _Beneficial Owner_ " means, with respect to any security, a Person who

disposition of, such security.  The terms " _Beneficially Own_ " and "
_Beneficial Ownership_ " shall have correlative meanings.

heading "BL Investors" in the BL Investors TRA, as defined below.

  



  

" _BL Investors TRA_ " means that Tax Receivable Agreement between PubCo, the
BL Investors, and any other parties thereto, dated as of [●], 202[●].

  



  

" _Blackstone Investors_ " means the entities listed on the signature pages
hereto under the heading "Blackstone Investors."

  



  

" _Blended Rate_ " means, with respect to any Taxable Year, the sum of the
effective rates of Tax imposed on the aggregate net income of the
Corporate Taxpayer in each state or local jurisdiction in which the Corporate
Taxpayer files Tax Returns for such Taxable Year, with the maximum effective
rate in any state or local jurisdiction being equal to the product of (i) the
apportionment factor on the income or franchise Corporate Taxpayer Return in
such jurisdiction for such Taxable Year and (ii) the maximum
applicable corporate Tax rate in effect in such jurisdiction in such Taxable
Year. As an illustration of the calculation of Blended Rate for a Taxable
Year, if the Corporate Taxpayer solely files Tax Returns in State 1 and State
2 in a Taxable Year, the maximum applicable corporate Tax rates in effect in
such states in such Taxable Year are 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively, and the
apportionment factors for such states in such Taxable Year are 55% and 45%
respectively, then the Blended Rate for such Taxable Year is equal to
6.05% (i.e., 6.5% multiplied by 55% plus 5.5% multiplied by 45%).

the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form)

Section 2.2. _Tax Benefit Schedule_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days
after the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for any Taxable Year in which there is a
Realized Tax Benefit or a Realized Tax Detriment Attributable to a TRA Party,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide to such TRA Party a schedule showing, in
reasonable detail, the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit and Tax
Benefit Payment, or the Realized Tax Detriment, as applicable, in respect of
such TRA Party for such Taxable Year (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ "). Each Tax
Benefit Schedule will become final as provided in Section 2.3(a) and may be
amended as provided in Section 2.3(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in
Section 2.3(b)).

  



  

(b) _Applicable Principles_.

  



  

(i) _General_. Subject to Section 3.3, the Realized Tax Benefit
(or the Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable Year is intended to
measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Taxes of the
Corporate Taxpayer for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Attributes,
determined using a "with and without" methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of
any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered to
be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or
the appropriate provisions of United States state and local income and
franchise Tax law, as applicable, governing the use, limitation and
expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or
carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax
Attribute and another portion that is not, such portions shall be considered
to be used in accordance with the "with and without" methodology. The parties
agree that (A) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon)
attributable to Pre-Merger NOLs or LTIP Deductions will be treated as non-
qualifying property or money for purposes of Sections 351 or 356 of the Code
received in the Blocker Merger, (B) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than
Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to the Basis Adjustments will be
treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments that have the
effect of creating additional Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the
Corporate Taxpayer in the year of payment, (C) all Tax Benefit Payments
(other than Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to the Transaction Basis
Adjustments will be treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments
that have the effect of creating additional Transaction Basis Adjustments to
Reference Assets for the Corporate Taxpayer in the year of payment, (D) as a
result, such additional Basis Adjustments and Transaction Basis Adjustments
will be incorporated into the current year calculation and into future year
calculations, as appropriate, and (E) the Actual Tax Liability will take into
account the deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be
accounted for as Imputed Interest.

(ii) _Applicable Principles of Section 734(b) Exchanges_.
Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in this Agreement, the
foregoing treatment set out in Section 2.3(b)(i) shall not be required to
apply to payments hereunder to a TRA Party in respect of a Section 734(b)
Exchange by such TRA Party. For the avoidance of doubt, payments made under
this Agreement relating to a Section 734(b) Exchange shall not be treated as
resulting in a Transaction Basis Adjustment or Basis Adjustment to the extent
such payments are treated as Imputed Interest. The parties intend that (A) a
TRA Party that has made a Section 734(b) Exchange shall, with respect to the
Transaction Basis Adjustment or Basis Adjustment resulting from such Section
734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such Section 734(b)
Exchange, be entitled to Tax Benefit Payments attributable to such
Transaction Basis Adjustments or Basis Adjustments only to the extent such
Transaction Basis Adjustments or Basis Adjustments are allocable to the
Corporate Taxpayer following such Section 734(b) Exchange (without taking into
account any concurrent or subsequent Exchanges) and (B) if, as a result of a
subsequent Exchange, an increased portion of the Basis Adjustments resulting
from such Section 734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such
Section 734(b) Exchange becomes allocable to the Corporate Taxpayer, then the
LLC Unit Holder that makes such subsequent Exchange shall be entitled to a
Tax Benefit Payment calculated in respect of such increased portion.

  



  

Section 2.3. _Procedures, Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a
TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this Agreement, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early Termination
Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
also (x) deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and work papers, as
determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA
Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were
relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule and (y) allow such TRA Party
reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate representatives at the
Corporate Taxpayer, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably
requested by such TRA Party, in connection with a review of such Schedule.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule that is delivered to a
TRA Party, along with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a
reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax
Liability and the Hypothetical Tax Liability and identifies any material
assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes
of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall
become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the
date on which all relevant TRA Parties are treated as having received the
applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA
Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days from such date
provides the Corporate Taxpayer with written notice of a material objection
to such Schedule (" _Objection Notice_ ") made in good faith or (ii)
provides a written waiver of such right of any Objection Notice within the
period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or
amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the
Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues
raised in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt
by the Corporate Taxpayer of an Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and
the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures as
described in Section 7.9 of this Agreement (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_
"). The TRA Party Representative will fairly represent the interests of each
of the TRA Parties and shall use reasonable efforts to timely raise and
pursue, in accordance with this Section 2.3(a), any reasonable objection to
a Schedule or amendment thereto timely communicated in writing to the TRA
Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

   

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable
Year may be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i)
in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct
material inaccuracies in the Schedule identified as a result of the receipt
of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date
the Schedule was provided to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with an Expert's
determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change
in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable
Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other Tax item
to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or
the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended
Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust an applicable TRA
Party's Basis Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to this
Agreement (any such Schedule, an " _Amended Schedule_ "). The Corporate
Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule to each TRA Party when the
Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis Schedule for the following taxable
year.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 3.1. _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Payments_. Within five (5) calendar days after a Tax Benefit
Schedule delivered to a TRA Party becomes final in accordance with Section
2.3(a) and Section 7.9, if applicable, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay such
TRA Party for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant
to Section 3.1(b) that is Attributable to the relevant TRA Party. Each such
Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account previously designated by such TRA Party to
the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
such TRA Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) no Tax Benefit Payment shall
be made in respect of estimated Tax payments, including, without limitation,
United States federal estimated income Tax payments and (y) the payments
provided for pursuant to the above sentence shall be computed separately for
each TRA Party. The Corporation and the TRA Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of any
Transaction Exchange or any future Exchange that may be subject to this
Agreement, the aggregate value of the Tax Benefit Payments cannot be
reasonably ascertained for U.S. federal income or other applicable tax
purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with
respect to each Transaction Exchange or Exchange by or with respect to any TRA
Party, if such TRA Party notifies the Corporate Taxpayer in writing of a
stated maximum selling price (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
15A.453-1(c)(2)) to be applied with respect to such Transaction Exchange or
Exchange, the amount of the initial consideration received in connection with
such Transaction Exchange or Exchange and the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments
to such TRA Party in respect of such Transaction Exchange or Exchange (other
than amounts accounted for as interest under the Code) shall not exceed such
stated maximum selling price.

  



  

   

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(b) A  " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party for a
Taxable Year means an amount, not less than zero, equal to the Net Tax
Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Party and the Interest Amount with
respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, the Interest
Amount shall not be treated as interest, but instead, shall be treated as
additional consideration in the applicable transaction, unless otherwise
required by law. Subject to Section 3.3, the " _Net Tax Benefit_ " for a
Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any, of 85% of the
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year, over
the total amount of payments previously made under the first sentence
of Section 3.1(a) (excluding payments attributable to Interest Amounts);
_provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that no such recipient shall be
required to return any portion of any previously made Tax Benefit Payment. The
" _Interest Amount_ " shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit
calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions) for
filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with
respect to Taxes for such Taxable Year until the payment date under Section
3.1(a).

  



  

Section 3.2. _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the
provisions of this Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of any
amount (including interest) required under this Agreement or the BL Investors
TRA. The provisions of this Agreement and the BL Investors TRA shall be
construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such intentions are realized.

  



  

Section 3.3. _Pro Rata Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in Section
3.1 to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax Benefit of
the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to the Tax Attributes is limited in a
particular Taxable Year because the Corporate Taxpayer does not have
sufficient taxable income, the Net Tax Benefit for the Corporate Taxpayer and
the "Net Tax Benefit" of the Corporate Taxpayer under the BL Investors TRA
shall be allocated among all parties eligible for Tax Benefit Payments
under this Agreement and all parties eligible for "Tax Benefit Payments"
under the BL Investors TRA in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit,
as such term is defined in this Agreement and the BL Investors TRA, as
applicable, that would have been Attributable to each such party if the
Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient taxable income so that there were no such
limitation.

  



  

Section 3.4. _Payment Ordering_. If for any reason the Corporate
Taxpayer does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all
Tax Benefit Payments due under this Agreement or any "Tax Benefit Payment"
due under the BL Investors TRA in respect of a particular Taxable Year, then
the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree that (i) Tax Benefit Payments
for such Taxable Year shall be allocated to all parties eligible for Tax
Benefit Payments under this Agreement or the BL Investors TRA in
proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit as such term is defined in this
Agreement and the BL Investors TRA, as applicable, that would have been
Attributable to each TRA Party if the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient cash
available to make such Tax Benefit Payments and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payments
shall be made in respect of any Taxable Year under either the BL Investors TRA
or this Agreement until all Tax Benefit Payments to all TRA Parties and all
"TRA Parties" under the BL Investors TRA in respect of all prior Taxable
Years have been made in full.

Article IV

  



  

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 4.1. _Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement_.

  



  

(a) The Corporate Taxpayer may terminate this Agreement with
respect to all amounts payable to the TRA Parties and with respect to all of
the Units held by the TRA Parties at any time by paying to each TRA Party the
Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Agreement shall only terminate upon the receipt of the
Early Termination Payment by all TRA Parties, and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Corporate Taxpayer may withdraw any notice to execute its
termination rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior to the time at which any
Early Termination Payment has been paid.  Upon payment of the Early
Termination Payment by the Corporate Taxpayer, none of the TRA Parties or the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have any further payment obligations under this
Agreement, other than for any (a) Tax Benefit Payments due and payable
and that remain unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and (b) Tax Benefit
Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of the
Early Termination Notice (except to the extent that the amount described in
clause (b) is included in the Early Termination Payment). If an Exchange
occurs after the Corporate Taxpayer makes all of the required Early
Termination Payments, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under
this Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer (1) breaches any of
its material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure
to make any payment when due, failure to honor any other material obligation
required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of
this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise or
(2)(A) shall commence any case, proceeding or other action (i) under any
existing or future law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of debtors, seeking to have
an order for relief entered with respect to it, or seeking to adjudicate a
bankruptcy or insolvency, or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or other relief with
respect to it or its debts or (ii) seeking an appointment of a receiver,
trustee, custodian, conservator or other similar official for it or for all
or any substantial part of its assets, or it shall make a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors or (B) there shall be commenced against the
Corporate Taxpayer any case, proceeding or other action of the nature
referred to in clause (A) above that remains undismissed or undischarged for a
period of sixty (60) calendar days, all obligations hereunder shall be
automatically accelerated and shall be immediately due and payable, and such
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such breach and shall include, but not be limited
to, (1) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if an Early Termination
Notice had been delivered on the date of a breach, (2) any Tax Benefit
Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of a breach,
and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of a breach; provided that
procedures similar to the procedures of Section 4.2 shall apply with respect
to the determination of the amount payable by the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant
to this sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing (other than as set forth in
subsection (2) above), in the event that the Corporate Taxpayer breaches this
Agreement, each TRA Party shall be entitled to elect to receive the amounts
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above or to seek specific
performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that the failure to make
any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three (3) months of the
date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a breach of a material
obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, and that
it will not be considered to be a breach of a material obligation under this
Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three (3)
months of the date such payment is due. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a breach of a material obligation
of this Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer fails to make any Tax Benefit
Payment or payment made with respect to Section 4.1(c) when due to the
extent that the Corporate Taxpayer has insufficient funds to make such
payment; _provided_ , that the interest provisions of Section 5.2 shall apply
to such late payment (unless the Corporate Taxpayer does not have sufficient
funds to make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by any Senior
Obligations, in which case Section 5.2 shall apply, but the Default Rate shall
be replaced by the Agreed Rate).

  



  

   

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

(c) In the event of a Change of Control, all obligations hereunder
shall be accelerated and such obligations shall be calculated as if an Early
Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such Change of Control
and utilizing the Valuation Assumptions by substituting in each case the
terms "the closing date of a Change of Control" in each place where the phrase
"Early Termination Date" appears. Such obligations shall include, but not be
limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if the Early
Termination Date is the date of such Change of Control, (2) any Tax Benefit
Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of such Change
of Control, and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due
for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including the date of such
Change of Control (except to the extent that any amounts described in clause
(2) or (3) are included in the Early Termination Payments). For the avoidance
of doubt, Sections 4.2 and 4.3 shall apply to a Change of Control, _mutadis
mutandi._

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (1) if the
Corporate Taxpayer terminates the BL Investors TRA, it shall be required to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.1(a), (2) any breach,
proceeding or action that results in an acceleration of the BL Investors TRA
shall be treated as a breach, proceeding or action that results in an
acceleration of this Agreement pursuant to Section 4.1(b), (3) any "Change of
Control" for purposes of the BL Investors TRA shall also be treated as a
Change of Control for purposes of this Agreement, and (4) without limiting the
foregoing, this Section 4.1 shall be applied consistently to this Agreement
and the BL Investors TRA.

  



  

Section 4.2. _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate Taxpayer
chooses to exercise its right of early termination under Section 4.1 above,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to each TRA Party notice of such
intention to exercise such right (" _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a
schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") specifying the Corporate
Taxpayer's intention to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail
the calculation of the Early Termination Payment(s) due for each TRA Party.
Each Early Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on all parties
thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which all TRA Parties are
treated as having received such Schedule or amendment thereto under Section
7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days
after such date provides the Corporate Taxpayer with notice of a material
objection to such Schedule made in good faith (" _Material Objection Notice_
") or (ii) provides a written waiver of such right of a Material Objection
Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which case such
Schedule becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by the Corporate
Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any
reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of
the Material Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures in which case such
Schedule becomes binding ten (10) calendar days after the conclusion of the
Reconciliation Procedures. The TRA Party Representative will fairly represent
the interests of each of the TRA Parties and shall timely raise and pursue,
in accordance with this Section 4.2, any reasonable objection to an Early
Termination Schedule or amendment thereto timely communicated in writing to
the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

Section 4.3. _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within three (3) calendar days after an Early Termination
Effective Date, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Party an amount
equal to the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party. Such
payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account or accounts designated by such TRA Party or as otherwise agreed
by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Party or, in the absence of such
designation or agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing address provided
by such TRA Party to the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

(b) " _Early Termination Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party
shall equal the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
the applicable Early Termination Effective Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments
in respect of such TRA Party that would be required to be paid by the
Corporate Taxpayer beginning from the Early Termination Date and assuming that
the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such TRA Party are applied and that
each Tax Benefit Payment for the relevant Taxable Year would be due and
payable on the due date (without extensions) under applicable law as of the
Early Termination Effective Date for filing of IRS Form 1120 (or any
successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

Article V

  



  

 _SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 5.1. _Subordination_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment or payments made with
respect to Section 4.1(c) required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to
the TRA Parties under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in
right of payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
in respect of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money
of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (" _Senior Obligations_ ") and
shall rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all current or future
unsecured obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior
Obligations (including the BL Investors TRA). To the extent that any payment
under this Agreement is not permitted to be made at the time payment is due
as a result of this Section 5.1 and the terms of agreements governing Senior
Obligations, such payment obligation nevertheless shall accrue for the
benefit of TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall make such payments at
the first opportunity that such payments are permitted to be made in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Obligations. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the
Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates enters into future Tax receivable
or other similar agreements (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include the BL Investors TRA) (" _Future TRAs_ "), the Corporate Taxpayer
shall ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA shall provide that the Tax
Attributes subject to this Agreement are considered senior in priority to any
Tax attributes subject to any such Future TRA for purposes of calculating the
amount and timing of payments under any such Future TRA.

  



  

   

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

Section 5.2. _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. Subject to the
proviso in the last sentence of Section 4.1(b), the amount of all or any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to
the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this Agreement, whether as a
result of Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall be payable together with any
interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate and commencing from the date
on which such Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment was first due
and payable to the date of actual payment.

  



  

Article VI

  



  

 _NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION_

  



  

Section 6.1. _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer 's and FOA OpCo's
Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided herein, and except as provided in
the LLC Agreement, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have full responsibility for,
and sole discretion over, all Tax matters concerning the Corporate Taxpayer
and FOA OpCo, including, without limitation, the preparation, filing or
amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any issue
pertaining to Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall notify the TRA Party Representative of, and keep the TRA Party
Representative reasonably informed with respect to, the portion of any audit
of the Corporate Taxpayer and FOA OpCo by a Taxing Authority the outcome of
which is reasonably expected to materially affect the rights and obligations
of a TRA Party under this Agreement, and shall provide to the TRA Party
Representative reasonable opportunity to provide information and other input
to the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo and their respective advisors concerning
the conduct of any such portion of such audit; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Corporate Taxpayer and FOA OpCo shall not be required to take any action
that is inconsistent with any provision of the LLC Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.2. _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties
agree to report and cause to be reported for all purposes, including United
States federal, state and local Tax purposes and financial reporting
purposes, all Tax-related items (including, without limitation, the
Transaction Basis Adjustments, Basis Adjustments and each Tax Benefit Payment)
in a manner consistent with that contemplated by this Agreement or specified
by the Corporate Taxpayer in any Schedule required to be provided by or on
behalf of the Corporate Taxpayer under this Agreement unless otherwise
required by law. The Corporate Taxpayer shall (and shall cause FOA OpCo and
its other Subsidiaries to) use commercially reasonable efforts (for the
avoidance of doubt, taking into account the interests and entitlements of all
TRA Parties under this Agreement) to defend the Tax treatment contemplated by
this Agreement and any Schedule in any audit, contest or similar proceeding
with any Taxing Authority.

  



  

   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  



  

Section 6.3. _Cooperation_. Each of the TRA Parties shall (a) furnish
to the Corporate Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and
other materials as the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes
of making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate under
this Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any audit,
examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request in
connection with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter, and the Corporate
Taxpayer shall reimburse each such TRA Party for any reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 6.3. Upon
the request of any TRA Party, the Corporate Taxpayer shall cooperate in
taking any action reasonably requested by such TRA Party in connection with
its tax or financial reporting and/or the consummation of any assignment or
transfer of any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement,
including without limitation, providing any information or executing any
documentation.

and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by

Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective

public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 7.6. _Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a) Each TRA Party may assign all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to any Person as long as such transferee has
executed and delivered, or, in connection with such transfer, executes and
delivers, a joinder to this Agreement, substantially in form of _Exhibit A_
hereto, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all purposes of this Agreement,
except as otherwise provided in such joinder.

  



  

(b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such
amendment is approved in writing by each of the Corporate Taxpayer and by the
TRA Parties who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the total
amount of the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties hereunder
if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the
date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for
purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to
this Agreement since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided_ , that
no such amendment shall be effective if such amendment will have a
disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA Parties receive under
this Agreement unless such amendment is consented in writing by such TRA
Parties disproportionately affected who would be entitled to receive at
least two-thirds of the total amount of the Early Termination Payments
payable to all TRA Parties disproportionately affected hereunder if the
Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the date of
the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of
this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to this Agreement
since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided further_ , that no
such amendment may adversely affect the Blackstone Investors unless
such amendment is consented in writing by the Blackstone Investors. No
provision of this Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
Notwithstanding anything otherwise to the contrary, if the TRA Representative
and the TRA Representative under the BL Investors TRA shall jointly propose an
amendment to this Agreement and to the BL Investors TRA that is necessary or
appropriate in order to ensure that the respective rights and obligations
of the TRA Parties under this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
BL Investors under the BL Investors TRA are equal and ratable in all material
respects as though they were all party to the same agreement, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to such amendment,
whereupon such amendment will become effective without the consent of any
other party provided that no such amendment shall have a material adverse
effect on the Corporate Taxpayer.

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer shall
require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the
same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place.

  



  

Section 7.7. _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and
subsections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are
not to be considered in construing this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.8. _Resolution of Disputes_.

  



  

(a) Any and all disputes which are not governed by Section 7.9 and
cannot be settled amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation,
execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement
(including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration
provision) (each a  " _Dispute_ ") shall be finally settled by arbitration
conducted by a single arbitrator in New York in accordance with the then-
existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the
parties to the Dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within
thirty (30) calendar days of the receipt of the request for arbitration,
the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment. The
arbitrator shall be a lawyer admitted to the practice of law in the State of
New York and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language.
Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during
any arbitration proceedings.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), the Corporate
Taxpayer may bring an action or special proceeding in any court of competent
jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking
temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or
enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b),
each TRA Party (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of
this Section 7.8 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that
proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the
provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that
remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints the
Corporate Taxpayer as agent of such TRA Party for service of process in
connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of
process upon such agent, who shall promptly advise the TRA Party of any such
service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of
process upon the TRA Party in any such action or proceeding.

(c) (i) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION
OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS Section 7.8, OR
ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED
ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such
ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to
compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid
of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge
that the fora designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to
this Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one another; and

  



  

(ii) The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may have
to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary
suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in the preceding
paragraph of this Section 7.8 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the
same.

  



  

Section 7.9. _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer
and the TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with
respect to the matters governed by Sections 2.3 and 4.2 within the relevant
period designated in this Agreement (" _Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the
Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally
recognized expert (the  " _Expert_ ") in the particular area of disagreement
mutually acceptable to both parties. The Expert shall be a partner or
principal in a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and unless the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative agree otherwise, the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with the Corporate Taxpayer or the TRA Party
Representative or other actual or potential conflict of interest. If the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to agree on an
Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of
written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the Expert shall be appointed
by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert
shall resolve any matter relating to the TRA Party's Basis Schedule or an
amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto
within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a
Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days
or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the
matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is
the subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such
disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is
due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this
Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate
Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and
expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax
Return shall be borne by the Corporate Taxpayer except as provided in the
next sentence. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall
bear their own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert
adopts the TRA Party Representative's position, in which case the Corporate
Taxpayer shall reimburse the TRA Party Representative for any reasonable out-
of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts
the Corporate Taxpayer's position, in which case the TRA Party Representative
shall reimburse the Corporate Taxpayer for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses in such proceeding.  Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a
Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 7.9 shall be decided
by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute
and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be
binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA Parties and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

Section 7.10. _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.
To the extent that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by
such deductions or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify the applicable
withholding agent for any amounts imposed by any Taxing Authority together
with any costs and expenses related thereto. Each TRA Party shall promptly
provide the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo or other applicable withholding
agent with any applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form
W-9 or the applicable version of IRS Form W-8) reasonably requested, in
connection with determining whether any such deductions and withholdings are
required under the Code or any provision of United States state, local or
foreign Tax law.

  



  

Section 7.11. _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated
Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer is or becomes a member of an
affiliated or consolidated group of corporations that files a
consolidated income Tax Return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code
or any corresponding provisions of state or local law, then: (i)
the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group
as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments, Early Termination Payments and
other applicable items hereunder shall be computed with reference to the
consolidated taxable income of the group as a whole.

  

  

  



  

(b) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) transfers or is deemed to transfer any Unit or any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the
property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause
such transferee to assume the obligation to make payments hereunder with
respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any Reference Asset
or interest therein acquired (directly or indirectly) in such transfer (taking
into account any gain recognized in the transaction) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement as the transferee (or one of its Affiliates)
actually realizes Tax benefits from the Tax Attributes. If FOA OpCo transfers
(or is deemed to transfer for United States federal income Tax purposes) any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the
property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, FOA OpCo shall be treated as having
disposed of the Reference Asset in a wholly taxable transaction. The
consideration deemed to be received by FOA OpCo in a transaction contemplated
in the prior sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed
transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject,
in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.
If any member of a group described in Section 7.11(a) that owns any Unit
deconsolidates from the group (or the Corporate Taxpayer deconsolidates from
the group), then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause such member (or the parent
of the consolidated group in a case where the Corporate Taxpayer
deconsolidates from the group) to assume the obligation to make payments
hereunder with respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any
Reference Asset it owns (directly or indirectly) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement as the member (or one of its Affiliates)
actually realizes Tax benefits. If a transferee or a member of a group
described in Section 7.11(a) assumes an obligation to make payments hereunder
pursuant to either of the foregoing sentences, then the initial obligor is
relieved of the obligation assumed.

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in Section 7.11(a)) transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States
federal income Tax purposes) any Unit in a transaction that is wholly or
partially taxable, then for purposes of calculating payments under this
Agreement, FOA OpCo shall be treated as having disposed of the portion of any
Reference Asset that is indirectly transferred by the Corporate Taxpayer (
_i.e._ , taking into account the number of Units transferred) in a wholly or
partially taxable transaction in which all income, gain or loss is allocated
to the Corporate Taxpayer. The consideration deemed to be received by FOA
OpCo shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed transferred asset,
plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the case of a
transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to such
asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.

  



  

Section 7.12. _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the last sentence of Section 6.3, each TRA Party
and each of their assignees acknowledge and agree that the information of the
Corporate Taxpayer is confidential and, except in the course of performing any
duties as necessary for the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates, as
required by law or legal process or to enforce the terms of this Agreement,
such person shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not
disclose to any Person any confidential matters, acquired pursuant to this
Agreement, of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors,
concerning FOA OpCo and its Affiliates and successors or the Members, learned
by the TRA Party heretofore or hereafter. This Section 7.12 shall not apply
to (i) any information that has been made publicly available by the Corporate
Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a
result of an act of the TRA Party in violation of this Agreement) or is
generally known to the business community and (ii) the disclosure of
information to the extent necessary for the TRA Party to prepare and file its
Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the same from any Taxing
Authority or to prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any
Taxing Authority with respect to such returns. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, each TRA Party and each of their assignees (and each
employee, representative or other agent of the TRA Party or its assignees, as
applicable) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Corporate Taxpayer, FOA OpCo
and their Affiliates, and any of their transactions, and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA
Party relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure.

  



  

   

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) If a TRA Party or an assignee commits a breach, or threatens
to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 7.12, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of
this Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by
any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other
security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened
breach shall cause irreparable injury to the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its
Subsidiaries or the TRA Parties and the accounts and funds managed by the
Corporate Taxpayer and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate
remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  



  

Section 7.13. _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if, in connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a TRA
Party reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause
income (other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this
Agreement) recognized by the TRA Party upon any Exchange by such TRA Party to
be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at
ordinary income rates) for United States federal income Tax purposes or
would have other material adverse Tax consequences to such TRA Party, then at
the election of such TRA Party and to the extent specified by such TRA Party,
this Agreement (i) shall cease to have further effect with respect to such TRA
Party, (ii) shall not apply to an Exchange by such TRA Party occurring after
a date specified by such TRA Party, or (iii) shall otherwise be amended in a
manner determined by such TRA Party, provided that such amendment shall not
result in an increase in payments under this Agreement at any time as
compared to the amounts and times of payments that would have been due in the
absence of such amendment.

Section 7.14. _TRA Party Representative_. By executing this Agreement,
each of the TRA Parties shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted the
TRA Party Representative as his, her or its agent and attorney in fact with
full power of substitution to act from and after the date hereof and to do
any and all things and execute any and all documents on behalf of such TRA
Parties which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate any
matters under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) execution of
the documents and certificates required pursuant to this Agreement; (ii)
except to the extent specifically provided in this Agreement receipt and
forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement; (iv)
administration of the provisions of this Agreement; (v) any and all consents,
waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the TRA Party
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement and the execution or delivery of
any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith;
(vi) amending this Agreement or any of the instruments to be delivered to the
Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to this Agreement; (vii) taking actions the TRA
Party Representative is expressly authorized to take pursuant to the other
provisions of this Agreement; (viii) negotiating and compromising, on behalf
of such TRA Parties, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or
refraining from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby and executing, on behalf of such TRA
Parties, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to
such dispute or remedy; and (ix) engaging attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of such TRA Parties in connection with this Agreement or
any other agreement contemplated hereby and paying any fees related thereto.
The TRA Party Representative may resign upon thirty (30) days' written notice
to the Corporate Taxpayer. All reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the TRA Party Representative in its capacity as such
shall be promptly reimbursed by the Corporate Taxpayer upon invoice and
reasonable support therefor by the TRA Party Representative. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, none of the TRA Party Representative, any of its
Affiliates, or any of the TRA Party Representative's or Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees or other agents (each a " _Covered Person_ ")
shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to any
TRA Party, FOA OpCo or the Corporate Taxpayer for damages arising from any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the TRA Party Representative or any
other Person with respect to FOA OpCo or the Corporate Taxpayer, except in
the case of any action or omission which constitutes, with respect to such
Person, willful misconduct or fraud. Each of the Covered Persons may consult
with legal counsel, accountants, and other experts selected by it, and any
act or omission suffered or taken by it on behalf of FOA OpCo or the Corporate
Taxpayer or in furtherance of the interests of FOA OpCo or the Corporate
Taxpayer in good faith in reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of
such counsel, accountants, or other experts shall create a rebuttable
presumption of the good faith and due care of such Covered Person with respect
to such act or omission; _provided_ , that such counsel, accountants, or
other experts were selected with reasonable care. Each of the Covered Persons
may rely in good faith upon, and shall have no liability to FOA OpCo, the
Corporate Taxpayer or the TRA Parties for acting or refraining from acting
upon, any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document
reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper party or parties.

act on behalf of the Committee with respect to any matter, right, obligation,
or election which is the responsibility of, or which is allocated to, the
Committee herein, and which may be so delegated in accordance with Applicable

committee or subcommittee shall fail to qualify as a Qualifying Director
shall not invalidate any action that is otherwise valid under the Plan.

other decisions under or with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award
Agreement shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made

hereunder (unless constituting fraud or a willful criminal act or omission).
Each Indemnifiable Person shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense (including
attorneys' fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnifiable
Person in connection with or resulting from any action, suit, or proceeding
to which such Indemnifiable Person may be a party or in which such
Indemnifiable Person may be involved by reason of any action taken or omitted
to be taken or determination made with respect to the Plan or any Award
hereunder and against and from any and all amounts paid by such Indemnifiable
Person with the Company's approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such
Indemnifiable Person in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit,
or proceeding against such Indemnifiable Person, and the Company shall
advance to such Indemnifiable Person any such expenses promptly upon written
request (which request shall include an undertaking by the Indemnifiable
Person to repay the amount of such advance if it shall ultimately be
determined, as provided below, that the Indemnifiable Person is not entitled
to be indemnified); _provided_ , that the Company shall have the right, at
its own expense, to assume and defend any such action, suit, or proceeding and
once the Company gives notice of its intent to assume the defense, the
Company shall have sole control over such defense with counsel of the
Company's choice. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be
available to an Indemnifiable Person to the extent that a final judgment
or other final adjudication (in either case not subject to further appeal)
binding upon such Indemnifiable Person determines that the acts, omissions,
or determinations of such Indemnifiable Person giving rise to the
indemnification claim resulted from such Indemnifiable Person's fraud or
willful criminal act or omission or that such right of indemnification is
otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law or by the organizational documents of
any member of the Company Group. The foregoing right of indemnification shall
not be exclusive of or otherwise supersede any other rights of indemnification
to which such Indemnifiable Persons may be entitled under the organizational
documents of any member of the Company Group, as a matter of Applicable Law,
under an individual indemnification agreement or contract, or otherwise, or
any other power that the Company may have to indemnify such
Indemnifiable Persons or hold such Indemnifiable Persons harmless.

accordance with the Exchange Agreement, and (z) a lower number of shares of
Common Stock as determined by the Board; (ii) subject to Section 11 of
the Plan, no more than the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the

of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan; and (iii) during a single
fiscal year, each Non-Employee Director, shall be granted a number of shares
of Common Stock subject to Awards, taken together with any cash fees paid to
such Non-Employee Director during such fiscal year, equal to (A) a total
value of $750,000 (calculating the value of any such Awards based on the
grant date fair value of such Awards for financial reporting purposes) or (B)
such lower amount as determined by the Board prior to the Date of Grant,
either as part of the Company's Non-Employee Director compensation program or
as otherwise determined by the Board in the event of any change to such Non-
Employee Director's compensation program or for any particular period of
service. To the extent the Board makes a determination pursuant to clause
(iii)(B) above with respect to any year of service, such determination shall
in no event be applicable to any subsequent year of service without a
further determination by the Board in respect of any subsequent year of
service.

11

    



  

(c) _Share Counting_. Other than with respect to Substitute
Awards, to the extent that an Award expires or is canceled, forfeited,
terminated, settled in cash, or otherwise is settled without issuance to the
Participant of the full number of shares of Common Stock to which the Award
related, the unissued shares of Common Stock will again be available for grant
under the Plan. Shares of Common Stock withheld in payment of the Exercise
Price, or taxes relating to an Award, and shares equal to the number of shares
surrendered in payment of any Exercise Price, or taxes relating to an Award,
shall be deemed to constitute shares not issued to the Participant and shall
be deemed to again be available for Awards under the Plan; _provided, however_
, that such shares shall not become available for issuance hereunder if
either: (i) the applicable shares are withheld or surrendered following the
termination of the Plan; or (ii) at the time the applicable shares are
withheld or surrendered, it would constitute a material revision of the Plan
subject to stockholder approval under any then-applicable rules of the
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed.

  



  

(d) _Source of Shares_. Shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company in settlement of Awards may be authorized and unissued shares of
Common Stock, shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company,
shares of Common Stock purchased on the open market or by private purchase,
or a combination of the foregoing.

  



  

(e) _Substitute Awards_. Awards may, in the sole discretion of
the Committee, be granted under the Plan in assumption of, or in
substitution for, outstanding Awards previously granted by an entity directly
or indirectly acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines ("
_Substitute Awards_ "). Substitute Awards shall not be counted against the
Absolute Share Limit;  _provided_ , that Substitute Awards issued in
connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding
Options intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning
of Section 422 of the Code shall be counted against the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock available for Awards of Incentive Stock Options under
the Plan. Subject to applicable stock exchange requirements, available shares
of Common Stock under a stockholder-approved plan of an entity directly or
indirectly acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines (as
appropriately adjusted to reflect the acquisition or combination transaction)
may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of
shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan.

evidenced by an Award Agreement, which agreement need not be the same for each
Participant. Each Option so granted shall be subject to the conditions set
forth in this Section 7, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with
the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. All Options
granted under the Plan shall be Nonqualified Stock Options unless the
applicable Award Agreement expressly states that the Option is intended to be
an Incentive Stock Option. Incentive Stock Options shall be granted only to
Eligible Persons who are employees of a member of the Company Group, and no
Incentive Stock Option shall be granted to any Eligible Person who is
ineligible to receive an Incentive Stock Option under the Code. No Option
shall be treated as an Incentive Stock Option unless the Plan has been
approved by the stockholders of the Company in a manner intended to comply
with the stockholder approval requirements of Section 422(b)(1) of the Code;
_provided_ , that any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall
not fail to be effective solely on account of a failure to obtain such
approval, but rather such Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock
Option unless and until such approval is obtained. In the case of an
Incentive Stock Option, the terms and conditions of such grant shall be
subject to, and comply with, such rules as may be prescribed by Section 422
of the Code. If for any reason an Option intended to be an Incentive Stock
Option (or any portion thereof) shall not qualify as an Incentive Stock
Option, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option or portion
thereof shall be regarded as a Nonqualified Stock Option appropriately granted
under the Plan.

  



  

(b) _Exercise Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the
Committee in the case of Substitute Awards, the exercise price ("
_Exercise Price_ ") per share of Common Stock for each Option shall not be
less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such share (determined as of the
Date of Grant); _provided, however_ , that in the case of an Incentive Stock
Option granted to an employee who, at the time of the grant of such Option,
owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
stock of any member of the Company Group, the Exercise Price per share shall
be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per share on the Date of Grant.

  



  

(c) _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

  



  

(i) Options shall vest and become exercisable in such manner and
on such date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the
Committee including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of
the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such vesting
dates or events, the Committee may in its sole discretion accelerate the
vesting of any Options at any time and for any reason. Options shall expire
upon a date determined by the Committee, not to exceed ten years from the Date
of Grant (the  " _Option Period_ "); _provided_ , that if the Option Period
(other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option) would expire at a time
when trading in the shares of Common Stock is prohibited by the Company's
insider trading policy (or Company-imposed "blackout period"), then the
Option Period shall be automatically extended until the 30th day following
the expiration of such prohibition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall the Option Period exceed five years from the Date of Grant in the case
of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who on the Date of Grant
owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of
stock of any member of the Company Group.

  



  

   

 

13

    



  

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a
Participant's Termination by the Service Recipient for Cause, all outstanding
Options granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire;
(B) a Participant's Termination due to death or Disability, each outstanding
unvested Option granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and
expire, and each outstanding vested Option shall remain exercisable for one
year thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period);
and (C) a Participant's Termination for any other reason, each outstanding
unvested Option granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and
expire, and each outstanding vested Option shall remain exercisable for 90
days thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of the Option Period).

  



  

(d) _Method of Exercise and Form of Payment_. No shares of
Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to any exercise of an Option
until payment in full of the Exercise Price therefor is received by the
Company and the Participant has paid to the Company an amount equal to any
Federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income, employment, and any other
applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Plan. Options which have become exercisable may be
exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company (or telephonic instructions to the extent provided by the Committee)
in accordance with the terms of the Option accompanied by payment of the
Exercise Price. The Exercise Price shall be payable: (i) in cash, check, cash
equivalent, and/or shares of Common Stock valued at the Fair Market Value at
the time the Option is exercised (including, pursuant to procedures approved
by the Committee, by means of attestation of ownership of a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock in lieu of actual issuance of such shares to the
Company); _provided_ , that such shares of Common Stock are not subject to
any pledge or other security interest and have been held by the Participant
for at least six months (or such other period as established from time to
time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse accounting treatment applying
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")); or (ii) by such other
method as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including, without
limitation (A) in other property having a fair market value on the date of
exercise equal to the Exercise Price; (B) if there is a public market for the
shares of Common Stock at such time, by means of a broker-assisted "cashless
exercise" pursuant to which the Company is delivered (including
telephonically to the extent permitted by the Committee) a copy of
irrevocable instructions to a stockbroker to sell the shares of Common
Stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of the Option and to deliver
promptly to the Company an amount equal to the Exercise Price; or (C) a "net
exercise" procedure effected by withholding the minimum number of shares of
Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of an Option that are needed to
pay the Exercise Price and any Federal, state, local, and non-U.S.
income, employment, and any other applicable taxes that are statutorily
required to be withheld in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Plan. Any
fractional shares of Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

  



  

(e) _Notification upon Disqualifying Disposition of an Incentive
Stock Option_. Each Participant awarded an Incentive Stock Option under
the Plan shall notify the Company in writing immediately after the date the
Participant makes a disqualifying disposition of any share of Common Stock
acquired pursuant to the exercise of such Incentive Stock Option. A
disqualifying disposition is any disposition (including, without limitation,
any sale) of such share of Common Stock before the later of (i) the date that
is two years after the Date of Grant of the Incentive Stock Option, or (ii)
the date that is one year after the date of exercise of the Incentive Stock
Option. The Company may, if determined by the Committee and in accordance with
procedures established by the Committee, retain possession, as agent for the
applicable Participant, of any share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the
exercise of an Incentive Stock Option until the end of the period described
in the preceding sentence, subject to complying with any instructions from
such Participant as to the sale of such share of Common Stock.

  



  

   

 

14

    



  

(f) _Compliance With Laws, etc_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall a Participant be permitted to exercise an Option in a
manner which the Committee determines would violate the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as it may be amended from time to time, or any other Applicable Law.

  



  

8. Stock Appreciation Rights.

  



  

(a) _General_. Each SAR granted under the Plan shall be evidenced
by an Award Agreement. Each SAR so granted shall be subject to the
conditions set forth in this Section 8, and to such other conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award
Agreement. Any Option granted under the Plan may include tandem SARs. The
Committee also may award SARs to Eligible Persons independent of any Option.

  



  

(b) _Strike Price_. Except as otherwise provided by the Committee
in the case of Substitute Awards, the strike price (" _Strike Price_ ") per
share of Common Stock for each SAR shall not be less than 100% of the Fair
Market Value of such share (determined as of the Date of Grant).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a SAR granted in tandem with (or in
substitution for) an Option previously granted shall have a Strike Price
equal to the Exercise Price of the corresponding Option.

  



  

(c) _Vesting and Expiration; Termination_.

  



  

(i) A SAR granted in connection with an Option shall become
exercisable and shall expire according to the same vesting schedule
and expiration provisions as the corresponding Option. A SAR granted
independent of an Option shall vest and become exercisable in such manner and
on such date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the
Committee including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of
the Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such
vesting dates or events, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,
accelerate the vesting of any SAR at any time and for any reason. SARs shall
expire upon a date determined by the Committee, not to exceed ten years from
the Date of Grant (the " _SAR Period_ "); _provided_ , that if the SAR Period
would expire at a time when trading in the shares of Common Stock is
prohibited by the Company's insider trading policy (or Company-imposed
"blackout period"), then the SAR Period shall be automatically extended until
the 30th day following the expiration of such prohibition.

  



  

   

 

15

    



  

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of: (A) a
Participant's Termination by the Service Recipient for Cause, all outstanding
SARs granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire; (B)
a Participant's Termination due to death or Disability, each outstanding
unvested SAR granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and
expire, and each outstanding vested SAR shall remain exercisable for one year
thereafter (but in no event beyond the expiration of the SAR Period); and (C)
a Participant's Termination for any other reason, each outstanding unvested
SAR granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate and expire, and
each outstanding vested SAR shall remain exercisable for 90 days thereafter
(but in no event beyond the expiration of the SAR Period).

  



  

(d) _Method of Exercise_. SARs which have become exercisable may
be exercised by delivery of written or electronic notice of exercise to the
Company in accordance with the terms of the Award, specifying the number of
SARs to be exercised and the date on which such SARs were awarded.

  



  

(e) _Payment_. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall pay
to the Participant an amount equal to the number of shares subject to the
SAR that is being exercised multiplied by the excess of the Fair Market Value
of one share of Common Stock on the exercise date over the Strike Price, less
an amount equal to any Federal, state, local, and non-U.S. income, employment,
and any other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld
in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Plan. The Company shall pay such
amount in cash, in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value, or any
combination thereof, as determined by the Committee. Any fractional shares of
Common Stock shall be settled in cash.

  



  

9. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

(a) _General_. Each grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Restricted Stock
and Restricted Stock Unit so granted shall be subject to the conditions set
forth in this Section 9, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with
the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Notation; Escrow or
Similar Arrangement_. Upon the grant of Restricted Stock, the Committee
shall cause a stock certificate registered in the name of the Participant to
be issued or shall cause share(s) of Common Stock to be registered in the
name of the Participant and held in book-entry form subject to the Company's
directions and, if the Committee determines that the Restricted Stock shall
be held by the Company or in escrow rather than issued to the
Participant pending the release of the applicable restrictions, the Committee
may require the Participant to additionally execute and deliver to the
Company (i) an escrow agreement satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable,
and (ii) the appropriate stock power (endorsed in blank) with respect to the
Restricted Stock covered by such agreement. If a Participant shall fail to
execute and deliver (in a manner permitted under Section 13(a) of the Plan or
as otherwise determined by the Committee) an agreement evidencing an Award of
Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and blank stock power
within the amount of time specified by the Committee, the Award shall be null
and void. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 9, Section
13(b) of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant generally
shall have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to shares of
Restricted Stock, including, without limitation, the right to vote such
Restricted Stock. To the extent shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited, any
stock certificates issued to the Participant evidencing such shares shall be
returned to the Company, and all rights of the Participant to such shares and
as a stockholder with respect thereto shall terminate without
further obligation on the part of the Company. A Participant shall have no
rights or privileges as a stockholder as to Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

   

 

16

    



  

(c) _Vesting; Termination_.

  



  

(i) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall vest, and
any applicable Restricted Period shall lapse, in such manner and on such
date or dates or upon such event or events as determined by the Committee
including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any such dates or events, the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of any
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit or the lapsing of any applicable
Restricted Period at any time and for any reason.

  



  

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an
Award Agreement or otherwise, in the event of a Participant's Termination for
any reason prior to the time that such Participant's Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, have vested, (A) all vesting with
respect to such Participant's Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, as
applicable, shall cease and (B) unvested shares of Restricted Stock and
unvested Restricted Stock Units, as applicable, shall be forfeited to the
Company by the Participant for no consideration as of the date of such
Termination.

  



  

(d) _Issuance of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted
Stock Units_.

  



  

(i) Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to
any shares of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement shall be of no further force or effect with
respect to such shares, except as set forth in the applicable
Award Agreement. If an escrow arrangement is used, upon such expiration the
Company shall issue to the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary,
without charge, the stock certificate (or, if applicable, a notice evidencing
a book-entry notation) evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock which have
not then been forfeited and with respect to which the Restricted Period has
expired (rounded down to the nearest full share).

  



  

(ii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award
Agreement or otherwise, upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with
respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall issue to
the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, without charge, one share
of Common Stock (or other securities or other property, as applicable) for
each such outstanding Restricted Stock Unit; _provided, however_ , that the
Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to (A) pay cash or part cash and
part shares of Common Stock in lieu of issuing only shares of Common Stock in
respect of such Restricted Stock Units or (B) defer the issuance of shares of
Common Stock (or cash or part cash and part shares of Common Stock, as the
case may be) beyond the expiration of the Restricted Period if such extension
would not cause adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. If
a cash payment is made in lieu of issuing shares of Common Stock in respect
of such Restricted Stock Units, the amount of such payment shall be equal to
the Fair Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the date on which
the Restricted Period lapsed with respect to such Restricted Stock Units.

  



  

   

 

17

    



  

(e) _Legends on Restricted Stock_. Each certificate, if any, or
book entry representing Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan, if
any, shall bear a legend or book-entry notation substantially in the form of
the following, in addition to any other information the Company deems
appropriate, until the lapse of all restrictions with respect to such shares
of Common Stock:

  



  

TRANSFER OF THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS RESTRICTED
PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE FINANCE OF AMERICA Companies Inc. 2021 Omnibus
INCENTIVE PLAN AND A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT BETWEEN FINANCE OF
AMERICA Companies Inc. AND THE PARTICIPANT. A COPY OF SUCH PLAN AND AWARD
AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES OF FINANCE OF AMERICA
Companies Inc.

  



  

10. Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may grant Other Equity-Based Awards and Other Cash-Based Awards under the Plan to Eligible Persons, alone or in tandem with other Awards, in such amounts and dependent on such conditions as the Committee shall from time to time in its sole discretion determine including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 5(a) of the Plan. Each Other Equity-Based Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement and each Other Cash-Based Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced in such form as the Committee may determine from time to time. Each Other Equity-Based Award or Other Cash-Based Award, as applicable, so granted shall be subject to such conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement or other form evidencing such Award, including, without limitation, those set forth in Section 13(c) of the Plan.

  



  

11. Changes in Capital Structure and Similar Events. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to all Awards granted hereunder (other than Other Cash-Based Awards):

  



  

   

 

18

    



  

(a) _General_. In the event of (i) any dividend (other than
regular cash dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of
cash, shares of Common Stock, other securities, or other property),
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or
exchange of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company,
issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or
event that affects the shares of Common Stock (including a Change in Control),
or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, including
changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations, or other
requirements, that the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, could
result in substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights intended to be
granted to, or available for, Participants (any event in (i) or (ii), an "
_Adjustment Event_ "), the Committee shall, in respect of any such Adjustment
Event, make such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any, as
it deems equitable, to any or all of: (A) the Absolute Share Limit, or any
other limit applicable under the Plan with respect to the number of Awards
which may be granted hereunder; (B) the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Company (or number and kind of other securities or
other property) which may be issued in respect of Awards or with respect
to which Awards may be granted under the Plan or any Sub-Plan; and (C) the
terms of any outstanding Award, including, without limitation, (I) the number
of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company (or number and
kind of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards or
to which outstanding Awards relate; (II) the Exercise Price or Strike Price
with respect to any Award; or (III) any applicable performance measures;
_provided_ , that in the case of any "equity restructuring" (within the
meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 718 (or any successor pronouncement thereto)), the
Committee shall make an equitable or proportionate adjustment to outstanding
Awards to reflect such equity restructuring. Any adjustment under this
Section 11 shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

  



  

(b) _Adjustment Events_. Without limiting the foregoing, except
as may otherwise be provided in an Award Agreement, in connection with
any Adjustment Event, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for
any one or more of the following:

  



  

(i) substitution or assumption of Awards (or awards of an
acquiring company), acceleration of the exercisability of, lapse of
restrictions on, or termination of Awards, or a period of time (which shall
not be required to be more than ten days) for Participants to
exercise outstanding Awards prior to the occurrence of such event (and any
such Award not so exercised shall terminate upon the occurrence of such
event); and

  



  

(ii) subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary
to comply with Section 409A of the Code, cancellation of any one or more
outstanding Awards and payment to the holders of such Awards that are vested
as of such cancellation (including, without limitation, any Awards that would
vest as a result of the occurrence of such event but for such cancellation or
for which vesting is accelerated by the Committee in connection with such
event) the value of such Awards, if any, as determined by the
Committee (which value, if applicable, may be based upon the price per share
of Common Stock received or to be received by other stockholders of the
Company in such event), including, without limitation, in the case of an
outstanding Option or SAR, a cash payment in an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of the Fair Market Value (as of a date specified by the Committee) of
the shares of Common Stock subject to such Option or SAR over the aggregate
Exercise Price or Strike Price of such Option or SAR (it being
understood that, in such event, any Option or SAR having a per share Exercise
Price or Strike Price equal to, or in excess of, the Fair Market Value of a
share of Common Stock subject thereto may be canceled and terminated without
any payment or consideration therefor), or, in the case of Restricted Stock,
Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards that are not vested as of
such cancellation, a cash payment or equity subject to deferred vesting and
delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions applicable to
such Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based Awards
prior to cancellation, or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

  



  

   

 

19

    



  

Payments to holders pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be made in cash or,
in the sole discretion of the Committee, in the form of such other
consideration necessary for a Participant to receive property, cash, or
securities (or combination thereof) as such Participant would have been
entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the transaction if the Participant
had been, immediately prior to such transaction, the holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by the Award at such time (less any applicable
Exercise Price or Strike Price).

  



  

(c) _Other Requirements_. Prior to any payment or adjustment
contemplated under this Section 11, the Committee may require a
Participant to (i) represent and warrant as to the unencumbered title to the
Participant's Awards; (ii) bear such Participant's pro rata share of any
post-closing indemnity obligations, and be subject to the same post-closing
purchase price adjustments, escrow terms, offset rights, holdback terms, and
similar conditions as the other holders of Common Stock, subject to any
limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code; and (iii) deliver customary transfer documentation as reasonably
determined by the Committee.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Any adjustment provided under this
Section 11 may provide for the elimination of any fractional share that
might otherwise become subject to an Award.

  



  

(e) _Binding Effect_. Any adjustment, substitution, determination
of value or other action taken by the Committee under this Section 11 shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

  



  

12. Amendments and Termination.

  



  

(a) _Amendment and Termination of the Plan_. The Board may amend,
alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or any portion thereof at
any time; _provided_ , that no such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuance, or termination shall be made without stockholder approval if:
(i) such approval is required under Applicable Law; (ii) it would materially
increase the number of securities which may be issued under the Plan (except
for increases pursuant to Section 5 or 11 of the Plan), or (iii) it would
materially modify the requirements for participation in the Plan; _provided,
further_ , that any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance,
or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of any
Participant or any holder or beneficiary of any Award theretofore granted
shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of the affected
Participant, holder, or beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amendment shall be made to the last proviso of Section 12(b) of the Plan
without stockholder approval.

  



  

(b) _Amendment of Award Agreements_. The Committee may, to the
extent consistent with the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award
Agreement, waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or
alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel, or terminate, any Award
theretofore granted or the associated Award Agreement, prospectively or
retroactively (including after a Participant's Termination);  _provided_ ,
that, other than pursuant to Section 11, any such waiver, amendment,
alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation, or termination that
would materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant with
respect to any Award theretofore granted shall not to that extent be
effective without the consent of the affected Participant; _provided, further_
, that without stockholder approval, except as otherwise permitted under
Section 11 of the Plan, (i) no amendment or modification may reduce the
Exercise Price of any Option or the Strike Price of any SAR; (ii) the
Committee may not cancel any outstanding Option or SAR and replace it with a
new Option or SAR (with a lower Exercise Price or Strike Price, as the case
may be) or other Award or cash payment that is greater than the intrinsic
value (if any) of the canceled Option or SAR; and (iii) the Committee may not
take any other action which is considered a "repricing" for purposes of the
stockholder approval rules of any securities exchange or inter-dealer
quotation system on which the securities of the Company are listed or quoted.

  



  

   

 

20

    



  

13. General.

  



  

(a) _Award Agreements_. Each Award (other than an Other Cash-
Based Award) under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement,
which shall be delivered to the Participant to whom such Award was granted
and shall specify the terms and conditions of the Award and any rules
applicable thereto, including, without limitation, the effect on such Award of
the death, Disability, or Termination of a Participant, or of such other
events as may be determined by the Committee. For purposes of the Plan, an
Award Agreement may be in any such form (written or electronic) as determined
by the Committee (including, without limitation, a Board or
Committee resolution, an employment agreement, a notice, a certificate, or a
letter) evidencing the Award. The Committee need not require an Award
Agreement to be signed by the Participant or a duly authorized representative
of the Company.

  



  

(b) _Nontransferability_. Each Award shall be exercisable only by
such Participant to whom such Award was granted during the Participant's
lifetime, or, if permissible under Applicable Law, by the Participant's legal
guardian or representative. No Award may be assigned, alienated, pledged,
attached, sold, or otherwise transferred or encumbered by a Participant
(unless such transfer is specifically required pursuant to a domestic
relations order or by Applicable Law) other than by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation,
pledge, attachment, sale, transfer, or encumbrance shall be void and
unenforceable against any member of the Company Group; _provided_ , that the
designation of a beneficiary shall not constitute an assignment, alienation,
pledge, attachment, sale, transfer, or encumbrance.

  



  

(c) _Dividends and Dividend Equivalents_.

  



  

(i) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide a
Participant as part of an Award with dividends, dividend equivalents, or
similar payments in respect of Awards, payable in cash, shares of Common
Stock, other securities, other Awards or other property (in each case,
without interest), on a current or deferred basis, on such terms and
conditions as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion,
including, without limitation, payment directly to the Participant,
withholding of such amounts by the Company subject to vesting of the Award or
reinvestment in additional shares of Common Stock, Restricted Stock, or other
Awards.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, unless otherwise provided in
the Award Agreement, any dividend otherwise payable in respect of any
share of Restricted Stock that remains subject to vesting conditions at the
time of payment of such dividend shall be retained by the Company, and remain
subject to the same vesting conditions as the share of Restricted Stock to
which the dividend relates and shall be delivered (without interest) to the
Participant within 15 days following the date on which such restrictions on
such Restricted Stock lapse (and the right to any such accumulated dividends
shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of the Restricted Stock to which such
dividends relate).

  



  

   

 

21

    



  

(iii) To the extent provided in an Award Agreement, the holder of
outstanding Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to be credited
with dividend equivalent payments (upon the payment by the Company of
dividends on shares of Common Stock) either in cash or, in the sole
discretion of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market
Value equal to the amount of such dividends (and interest may, in the sole
discretion of the Committee, be credited on the amount of cash dividend
equivalents at a rate and subject to such terms as determined by the
Committee), which accumulated dividend equivalents (and interest thereon, if
applicable) shall be payable at the same time as the underlying Restricted
Stock Units are settled following the date on which the Restricted
Period lapses with respect to such Restricted Stock Units, and if such
Restricted Stock Units are forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to
such dividend equivalent payments (or interest thereon, if applicable).

  



  

(d) _Tax Withholding_.

  



  

(i) A Participant shall be required to pay to the Company or one
or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, an amount in cash (by check or
wire transfer) equal to the aggregate amount of any income, employment, and/or
other applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld in
respect of an Award. Alternatively, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may
elect, in its sole discretion, to satisfy this requirement by withholding
such amount from any cash compensation or other cash amounts owing to a
Participant.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may (but is not
obligated to), in its sole discretion, permit or require a Participant
to satisfy all or any portion of the minimum income, employment, and/or other
applicable taxes that are statutorily required to be withheld with respect to
an Award by: (A) the delivery of shares of Common Stock (which are not subject
to any pledge or other security interest) that have been both held by the
Participant and vested for at least six months (or such other period as
established from time to time by the Committee in order to avoid adverse
accounting treatment under applicable accounting standards) having an
aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such minimum statutorily required
withholding liability (or portion thereof); or (B) having the Company
withhold from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to,
or that would otherwise be retained by, the Participant upon the grant,
exercise, vesting, or settlement of the Award, as applicable, a number of
shares of Common Stock with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to an
amount, subject to clause (iii) below, not in excess of such minimum
statutorily required withholding liability (or portion thereof).

  



  

(iii) The Committee, subject to its having considered the
applicable accounting impact of any such determination, has full discretion
to allow Participants to satisfy, in whole or in part, any additional income,
employment, and/or other applicable taxes payable by them with respect to an
Award by electing to have the Company withhold from the shares of Common Stock
otherwise issuable or deliverable to, or that would otherwise be retained by,
a Participant upon the grant, exercise, vesting, or settlement of the Award,
as applicable, shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value
that is greater than the applicable minimum required statutory
withholding liability (but such withholding may in no event be in excess of
the maximum statutory withholding amount(s) in a Participant's relevant tax
jurisdictions).

  



  

   

 

22

    



  

(e) _Data Protection_. By participating in the Plan or accepting
any rights granted under it, each Participant consents to the collection and
processing of personal data relating to the Participant so that the Company
and its Affiliates can fulfill their obligations and exercise their rights
under the Plan and generally administer and manage the Plan. This data will
include, but may not be limited to, data about participation in the Plan and
shares offered or received, purchased, or sold under the Plan from time
to time and other appropriate financial and other data (such as the date on
which the Awards were granted) about the Participant and the Participant's
participation in the Plan.

  



  

(f) _No Claim to Awards; No Rights to Continued Employment;
Waiver_. No employee of any member of the Company Group, or other
Person, shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under the Plan
or, having been selected for the grant of an Award, to be selected for a
grant of any other Award. There is no obligation for uniformity of treatment
of Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards. The terms and
conditions of Awards and the Committee's determinations and interpretations
with respect thereto need not be the same with respect to each Participant
and may be made selectively among Participants, whether or not such
Participants are similarly situated. Neither the Plan nor any action taken
hereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant any right to be
retained in the employ or service of the Service Recipient or any other member
of the Company Group, nor shall it be construed as giving any Participant any
rights to continued service on the Board. The Service Recipient or any other
member of the Company Group may at any time dismiss a Participant from
employment or discontinue any consulting relationship, free from any
liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in
the Plan or any Award Agreement. By accepting an Award under the Plan, a
Participant shall thereby be deemed to have waived any claim to continued
exercise or vesting of an Award or to damages or severance entitlement
related to non-continuation of the Award beyond the period provided under the
Plan or any Award Agreement, except to the extent of any provision to the
contrary in any written employment contract or other agreement between the
Service Recipient and/or any member of the Company Group and the Participant,
whether any such agreement is executed before, on, or after the Date of
Grant.

  



  

(g) _International Participants_. With respect to Participants
who reside or work outside of the United States of America, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan and create or amend
Sub-Plans or amend outstanding Awards with respect to such Participants in
order to permit or facilitate participation in the Plan by such Participants,
conform such terms with the requirements of Applicable Law or to obtain more
favorable tax or other treatment for a Participant or any member of the
Company Group.

  



  

   

 

23

    



  

(h) _Designation and Change of Beneficiary_. Each Participant may
file with the Committee a written designation of one or more Persons as
the beneficiary or beneficiaries, as applicable, who shall be entitled to
receive the amounts payable with respect to an Award, if any, due under the
Plan upon the Participant's death. A Participant may, from time to time,
revoke or change the Participant's beneficiary designation without the
consent of any prior beneficiary by filing a new designation with the
Committee. The last such designation received by the Committee shall be
controlling; _provided, however_ , that no designation, or change or
revocation thereof, shall be effective unless received by the Committee prior
to the Participant's death, and in no event shall it be effective as of a
date prior to such receipt. If no beneficiary designation is filed by a
Participant, the beneficiary shall be deemed to be the Participant's spouse
or, if the Participant is unmarried at the time of death, the
Participant's estate.

  



  

(i) _Termination_. Except as otherwise provided in an Award
Agreement, unless determined otherwise by the Committee at any point following
such event: (i) neither a temporary absence from employment or service due to
illness, vacation, or leave of absence (including, without limitation, a call
to active duty for military service through a Reserve or National Guard unit)
nor a transfer from employment or service with one Service Recipient to
employment or service with another Service Recipient (or vice-versa) shall be
considered a Termination; and (ii) if a Participant undergoes a Termination,
but such Participant continues to provide services to the Company Group in a
non-employee capacity, such change in status shall be considered a Termination
for purposes of the Plan. Further, unless otherwise determined by the
Committee, in the event that any Service Recipient ceases to be a member of
the Company Group (by reason of sale, divestiture, spin-off, or other similar
transaction), unless a Participant's employment or service is transferred to
another entity that would constitute a Service Recipient immediately following
such transaction, such Participant shall be deemed to have suffered a
Termination hereunder as of the date of the consummation of such transaction.

  



  

(j) _No Rights as a Stockholder_. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Plan or any Award Agreement, no Person shall
be entitled to the privileges of ownership in respect of shares of Common
Stock which are subject to Awards hereunder until such shares have been
issued or delivered to such Person.

  



  

(k) _Government and Other Regulations_.

  



  

(i) The obligation of the Company to settle Awards in shares of
Common Stock or other consideration shall be subject to all Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding any terms or conditions of any Award to the contrary, the
Company shall be under no obligation to offer to sell or to sell, and shall
be prohibited from offering to sell or selling, any shares of Common Stock
pursuant to an Award unless such shares have been properly registered for
sale pursuant to the Securities Act with the Securities and Exchange
Commission or unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel (if the
Company has requested such an opinion), satisfactory to the Company, that
such shares may be offered or sold without such registration pursuant to an
available exemption therefrom and the terms and conditions of such exemption
have been fully complied with. The Company shall be under no obligation to
register for sale under the Securities Act any of the shares of Common Stock
to be offered or sold under the Plan. The Committee shall have the
authority to provide that all shares of Common Stock or other securities of
any member of the Company Group issued under the Plan shall be subject to
such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem
advisable under the Plan, the applicable Award Agreement, and Applicable Law,
and, without limiting the generality of Section 9 of the Plan, the Committee
may cause a legend or legends to be put on certificates representing shares
of Common Stock or other securities of any member of the Company Group issued
under the Plan to make appropriate reference to such restrictions or may cause
such Common Stock or other securities of any member of the Company Group
issued under the Plan in book-entry form to be held subject to the Company's
instructions or subject to appropriate stop-transfer orders. Notwithstanding
any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee reserves the right
to add, at any time, any additional terms or provisions to any Award granted
under the Plan that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or
advisable in order that such Award complies with the legal requirements of any
governmental entity to whose jurisdiction the Award is subject.

  



  

   

 

24

    



  

(ii) The Committee may cancel an Award or any portion thereof if
it determines, in its sole discretion, that legal or contractual
restrictions and/or blockage and/or other market considerations would make
the Company's acquisition of shares of Common Stock from the public markets,
the Company's issuance of Common Stock to the Participant, the Participant's
acquisition of Common Stock from the Company, and/or the Participant's sale
of Common Stock to the public markets, illegal, impracticable,
or inadvisable. If the Committee determines to cancel all or any portion of
an Award in accordance with the foregoing, the Company shall, subject to any
limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code: (A) pay to the Participant an amount equal to the excess of (I) the
aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such
Award or portion thereof canceled (determined as of the applicable exercise
date, or the date that the shares would have been vested or issued, as
applicable), over (II) the aggregate Exercise Price or Strike Price (in the
case of an Option or SAR, respectively) or any amount payable as a condition
of issuance of shares of Common Stock (in the case of any other Award), with
such amount being delivered to the Participant as soon as practicable
following the cancellation of such Award or portion thereof or (B) in the
case of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-Based
Awards, provide the Participant with a cash payment or equity subject to
deferred vesting and delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions
applicable to such Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, or Other Equity-
Based Awards, or the underlying shares in respect thereof.

  



  

(l) _No Section 83(b) Elections Without Consent of Company_. No
election under Section 83(b) of the Code or under a similar provision of law
may be made unless expressly permitted by the terms of the applicable Award
Agreement or by action of the Committee (or its designee in accordance with
Section 4(c) of the Plan, with such consent by action of the Committee or its
designee not to be unreasonably withheld) in writing prior to the making of
such election. If a Participant, in connection with the acquisition of shares
of Common Stock under the Plan or otherwise, is expressly permitted to make
such election and the Participant makes the election, the Participant shall
notify the Company of such election within ten days of filing notice of the
election with the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority, in
addition to any filing and notification required pursuant to Section 83(b) of
the Code or other applicable provision.

  



  

   

 

25

    



  

(m) _Payments to Persons Other Than Participants_. If the
Committee is provided with satisfactory evidence that any Person to whom any
amount is payable under the Plan is unable to care for the Participant's
affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or has died, then any
payment due to such Person or the Participant's estate (unless a prior claim
therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) shall be
paid to the Participant's spouse, child, relative, an institution
maintaining or having custody of such Person, or such other Person who is a
proper recipient under Applicable Law on behalf of such Person otherwise
entitled to payment. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the
liability of the Committee and the Company therefor.

  



  

(n) _Nonexclusivity of the Plan_. Neither the adoption of the
Plan by the Board nor the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the
Company for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the
power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem
desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of equity-based awards
otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable
generally or only in specific cases.

  



  

(o) _No Trust or Fund Created_. Neither the Plan nor any Award
shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind
or a fiduciary relationship between any member of the Company Group, on the
one hand, and a Participant or other Person, on the other hand. No provision
of the Plan or any Award shall require the Company, for the purpose of
satisfying any obligations under the Plan, to purchase assets or place any
assets in a trust or other entity to which contributions are made or
otherwise to segregate any assets, nor shall the Company be obligated to
maintain separate bank accounts, books, records, or other evidence of the
existence of a segregated or separately maintained or administered fund for
such purposes. Participants shall have no rights under the Plan other than as
unsecured general creditors of the Company, except that insofar as they may
have become entitled to payment of additional compensation by performance of
services, they shall have the same rights as other service providers
under general law.

  



  

(p) _Reliance on Reports_. Each member of the Committee and each
member of the Board shall be fully justified in acting or failing to act, as
the case may be, and shall not be liable for having so acted or failed to act
in good faith, in reliance upon any report made by the independent public
accountant of any member of the Company Group and/or any other information
furnished in connection with the Plan by any agent of the Company or the
Committee or the Board, other than himself or herself.

  



  

(q) _Relationship to Other Benefits_. No payment under the Plan
shall be taken into account in determining any benefits under any pension,
retirement, profit sharing, group insurance, or other benefit plan of the
Company except as otherwise specifically provided in such other plan or as
required by Applicable Law.

  



  

(r) _Governing Law_. The Plan shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts made and performed wholly within the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the conflict of laws' provisions thereof. EACH PARTICIPANT
WHO ACCEPTS AN AWARD IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
SUIT, ACTION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING INSTITUTED BY OR AGAINST SUCH PARTICIPANT
IN RESPECT OF THE PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.

  



  

   

 

26

    



  

(s) _Severability_. If any provision of the Plan or any Award or
Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction or as to any Person or Award, or would
disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the
Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to
the applicable laws, or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without,
in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the
Plan or the Award, such provision shall be construed or deemed stricken as to
such jurisdiction, Person, or Award and the remainder of the Plan and
any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

(t) _Obligations Binding on Successors_. The obligations of the
Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or
organization resulting from the merger, consolidation, or other
reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or
organization succeeding to substantially all of the assets and business of
the Company.

  



  

(u) _Section 409A of the Code_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, it
is intended that the provisions of the Plan comply with Section 409A of
the Code, and all provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted
in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties
under Section 409A of the Code. Each Participant is solely responsible and
liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may be imposed on
or in respect of such Participant in connection with the Plan (including
any taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code), and neither the
Service Recipient nor any other member of the Company Group shall have any
obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold such Participant (or any
beneficiary) harmless from any or all of such taxes or penalties. With
respect to any Award that is considered "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A of the Code, references in the Plan to "termination of
employment" (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean  "separation from
service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, each of the payments that may be made in respect of
any Award granted under the Plan is designated as a separate payment.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if a
Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section
409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, no payments in respect of any Awards that are
"deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code and which would
otherwise be payable upon the Participant's "separation from service" (as
defined in Section 409A of the Code) shall be made to such Participant prior
to the date that is six months after the date of such Participant's 
"separation from service" or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death.
Following any applicable six-month delay, all such delayed payments will be
paid in a single lump sum on the earliest date permitted under Section 409A of
the Code that is also a business day.

  



  

   

 

27

    



  

(iii) Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in an Award
Agreement or otherwise, in the event that the timing of payments in respect
of any Award (that would otherwise be considered "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code) are accelerated upon the occurrence of
(A) a Change in Control, no such acceleration shall be permitted unless the
event giving rise to the Change in Control satisfies the definition of a
change in the ownership or effective control of a corporation, or a change in
the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation pursuant
to Section 409A of the Code or (B) a Disability, no such acceleration shall
be permitted unless the Disability also satisfies the definition of
"Disability" pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(v) _Clawback/Repayment_. All Awards shall be subject to
reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent necessary to
comply with (i) any clawback, forfeiture or other similar policy adopted by
the Board or the Committee and as in effect from time to time; and (ii)
Applicable Law. Further, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to the
extent that the Participant receives any amount in excess of the amount that
the Participant should otherwise have received under the terms of the Award
for any reason (including, without limitation, by reason of a financial
restatement, mistake in calculations or other administrative error), the
Participant shall be required to repay any such excess amount to the Company.

  



  

(w) _Detrimental Activity_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if a Participant has engaged in any Detrimental
Activity, as determined by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole
discretion, provide for one or more of the following:

  



  

(i) cancellation of any or all of such Participant's outstanding
Awards; or

  



  

(ii) forfeiture by the Participant of any gain realized on the
vesting or exercise of Awards, and repayment of any such gain promptly to the
Company.

  



  

(x) _Right of Offset_. The Company will have the right to offset
against its obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock (or other
property or cash) under the Plan or any Award Agreement any outstanding
amounts (including, without limitation, travel and entertainment or advance
account balances, loans, repayment obligations under any Awards, or amounts
repayable to the Company pursuant to tax equalization, housing, automobile,
or other employee programs) that the Participant then owes to any member of
the Company Group and any amounts the Committee otherwise deems appropriate
pursuant to any tax equalization policy or agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if an Award is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of
the Code, the Committee will have no right to offset against its obligation
to deliver shares of Common Stock (or other property or cash) under the Plan
or any Award Agreement if such offset could subject the Participant to the
additional tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code in respect of an
outstanding Award.

  



  

(y) _Expenses; Titles and Headings_. The expenses of
administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company Group. The titles and
headings of the sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only,
and in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such
titles or headings, shall control.

time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a
quorum shall be present. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
