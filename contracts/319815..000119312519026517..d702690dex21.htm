WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than

validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the
Offer) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL;

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Offer
and the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of

Regulations Section 1.368-2(g);

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of

(iv) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer

each of Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement, the performance by each of
Parent and Purchaser of its covenants and agreements contained herein and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions upon the
terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and (ii) determined that
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger and
the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger, are advisable
and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Purchaser and their
respective stockholder(s); and

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also
prescribe various terms of and conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree
as follows:

_ARTICLE I _

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and _provided_ that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated pursuant to Article IX and that the Company shall have complied
with its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event more than five (5) business days
following the date on which Parent files its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) the Offer to acquire the Company Common Stock for the
Offer Consideration. In the Offer, each share of Company Common Stock accepted
by Purchaser in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying each share of Company
Common Stock by such 

 



-2- 

    

 fractional share of Parent Common Stock, determined as follows (the " _Offer
Consideration_ ") and is subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.1(e)_:

 

(i) if the Parent Trading Price is greater than the Floor Price, each share of
Company Common Stock accepted by Purchaser shall receive a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $4.75 by
(B) the Parent Trading Price, rounded to 4 decimal places; and

 

(ii) if the Parent Trading Price is equal to or less than $245.90 (the "
_Floor Price_ "), each share of Company Common Stock accepted by Purchaser
shall receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to 0.0193.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Applicable Parent Trading Price_
" shall mean, if clause (i) above was used to set the Offer Consideration, the
Parent Trading Price, and if clause (ii) above was used to set the Offer
Consideration, the Floor Price.

 

(b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that is disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Exchange Act and contains the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (including _Annex C_ ). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof (including _Annex C_ ). The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for exchange (and the obligation of Parent to cause Purchaser to accept
for exchange) shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there have
been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms
of the Offer a number of shares of Company Common Stock that, upon the
consummation of the Offer, together with the shares of Company Common Stock
then owned by Parent and Purchaser (if any) (excluding shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not
yet been "received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by
the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures), would represent at
least a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Minimum Condition_ "); and

 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex C_.

 

(c) _Other Terms of the Offer_. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to
waive or modify any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in
the terms of, or conditions to, the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein,
without the prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted
or withheld in its sole discretion), Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not
permit Purchaser to) (i) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, or
waive any of the conditions set forth in clauses (B), (C), (D) or (E) of
_Annex C_ or (ii) make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer
that (A) changes the form of consideration to be paid in the

 



-3- 

    

 Offer, (B) decreases the consideration to be paid in the Offer or the number
of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer,
other than in a manner required or permitted by the provisions of _Section_
__ _ 1.1(f)_, (D) imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth
in _Annex C_ , (E) amends or modifies (for the avoidance of doubt, waivers
shall be governed by clause (i) above) any of the conditions set forth in
_Annex C_ or (F) amends or modifies any other term of or condition to the
Offer in any manner that is materially adverse to the holders of Company
Common Stock in their capacities as such.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Offer, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied
by_ the Applicable Parent Trading Price, rounded to the nearest cent.

 

(e) _Adjustments to Offer Consideration_. The Offer Consideration (including,
without limitation, the Floor Price) shall be adjusted appropriately, without
duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as
applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after the
date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
1.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 

(f) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, eastern standard time, on the
date that is the twentieth (20th) business day (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Section 14d-1(g) (3) and Rule 14e-1(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the Offer Date. In the event that the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire
on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended. 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)(i)_ or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, unless Parent receives the prior
written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in its sole
discretion) to not take any of the following actions:

 

(A) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or of the NASDAQ, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer or

 



-4- 

    

 the Merger, or to the extent necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or
its staff applicable to the Offer, the Offer Documents or the Form S-4;

 

(B) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer any of the conditions
to the Offer (other than the Minimum Condition, and other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the
Offer (if such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the
expiration of the Offer to occur at such time)) have not been satisfied or
validly waived, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend
the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten (10) business days
each (or for such longer or shorter period as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company) in order to permit the satisfaction or valid waiver of such
conditions to the Offer; and

(C) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer each condition to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition, and other than any such conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer (if
such conditions would be satisfied or validly waived were the expiration of
the Offer to occur at such time)) has been satisfied or validly waived and
the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, Purchaser may, and, at the
request in writing of the Company, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten
(10) business days each (with the length of each such period being determined
in good faith by Parent) (or for such longer period or shorter as may be
agreed by Parent and the Company); _ provided_ that in no event shall
Purchaser or Parent be required to extend the expiration of the Offer for more
than forty (40) business days in the aggregate for any extensions specifically
provided by this  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)(ii)(C)_;

_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, (x) any such extension pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.1(f)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any
manner the right of the Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of  _Article_ __ _ IX_; and (y) Purchaser shall not be required (and
Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser) to extend the Offer beyond
the Outside Date.

 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall extend the Offer or provide a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act in any manner other than in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of
the Company.

 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_, in which case
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) terminate the Offer
promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day) after such
termination of this Agreement.

(g) _Payment for Company Common Stock_. On the terms of and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all shares
of Company Common Stock that are

 



-5- 

    

 validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act)
after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(f)(ii)_) (or, at ParentÂ’s election, concurrently with the
expiration of the Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
waived) (such time of acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the shares of Parent Common Stock and
funds for the Fractional Share Consideration necessary to pay for any shares
of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment, or pay for,
any shares of Company Common Stock if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire
less than the shares of Company Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum
Condition. The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid promptly following the Acceptance Time net to the
holder thereof in shares of Parent Common Stock and cash for the Fractional
Share Consideration, without interest and subject to reduction for any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof.

(h) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents; Form S-4_.

(i) As soon as practicable on the Offer Date, Parent and Purchaser shall:

(A) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer, which
Schedule TO shall contain as an exhibit the Offer to Purchase and forms of the
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, and other customary
ancillary documents, in each case, in respect of the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ");

 

(B) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the
Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;

(C) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to the NASDAQ in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

(D) subject to the CompanyÂ’s compliance with _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Common Stock as and
to the extent required by the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Concurrently with the filing of the Offer Documents, Parent shall file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the
Securities Act the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
and the Merger (the " _Form S-4_"). 

 



-6- 

    

 The Form S-4 will include a preliminary prospectus containing the
information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(iii) The Offer Documents and the Form S-4 may include a description of the
determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of
Directors set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(a)_ that relate to the Offer,

meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. Except as

request of DLA and/or WSGR, officers of each of the Company and Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to DLA and WSGR, as
applicable, certificates, dated as of the necessary date, signed by such
officer of the Company or Parent, as applicable, containing customary
representations in connection with such opinions.

the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to _Section_ __ _
1.1(a)_ and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Cancelled Shares and any Converted Shares) shall be automatically

 



-11- 

    

 converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_.
From and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the applicable portion of Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2_,
including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 3.1(a)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the
amounts, if any, payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_.

 

(b) _Certain Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or is owned by
Parent or Purchaser shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (collectively, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ "). At the Effective Time, any shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than
Purchaser) or of the Company (the " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be converted
into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company ("
_Surviving Company_ _Stock_ ") equal to the product of (i) (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _divided by_ (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the total
number of shares of Surviving Company Stock outstanding immediately after the
consummation of the Merger.

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
(the " _Purchaser_ _Shares_ ") shall be automatically converted into and
become one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of Surviving Company Stock.

adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or

Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Parent
Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective

Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



-12- 

    

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the
exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company Stockholders for
the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At
or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of the aggregate amount of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ in
book-entry form to pay for the Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional
Share Consideration) and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Fractional Share Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions under _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_ (such evidence
of book-entry shares of Parent Common Stock and cash amounts, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock. In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration or Fractional
Share Consideration, Parent shall promptly deposit additional Parent Common
Stock or funds, as applicable, with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make,
delivery of the Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional
Share Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_ out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of
an agency of the United States of America which are backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America as reasonably directed by
Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the cash included in the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to
make such payments contemplated by this this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Company Common Stock Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail within two (2) business days
after the Effective Time to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,

 



-13- 

    

 only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are customarily
contained in such letters of transmittal and (B) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and,
if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, including any amount payable in
respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
3.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to
the provisions of this  _Article_ __ _ III_, including any Fractional Share
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any amounts that such holder has the
right to receive in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_ for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and
(y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has
been paid or is not required to be paid.

(ii)  _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of or non-certificated Company Common
Stock represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") and whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of
one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in
any event no later than two (2) business days, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article_ __ _ III_, including any
Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any amounts that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.2(f)_ for each 

 



-14- 

    

 share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Book-Entry Share,
and the Book-Entry Share so exchanged shall be forthwith cancelled. Payment of
the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made
to the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) _No Interest_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of
the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_)
or in respect of any Book-Entry Share.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Common Stock on the records of the Company. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, including any Fractional Share Consideration
and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or other distributions, as contemplated by this _Article_ __ _
III_, except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange AgentÂ’s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration, including
any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, and any dividends or other
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 3.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(e)_) or Book-
Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parent, the Company, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if
required by Parent, an indemnity bond, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, including any amount payable
in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 3.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_. The value of the indemnity

 



-15- 

    

 bond shall be reasonably calculated by the Exchange Agent, based on the
value of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates.

 

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder, and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent,
an indemnity bond) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book-Entry Share there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

Section 3.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding,
unexercised and unexpired as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than a Company Option covered by _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_),
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof,
shall be assumed by Parent and converted into and become an option to acquire
Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ "), on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under the Company Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that: (x) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Adjusted Option as of the Effective Time will be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_by_ the Offer Consideration, with any fractional shares in the resulting
product rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (y) the per share
exercise price for each Parent Common Stock that may be acquired upon exercise
of the Adjusted Option as of the Effective Time will be determined by
dividing the per share exercise price of the Company Option as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Offer Consideration, with any
fractional cent in the resulting quotient rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. Each Adjusted Option otherwise shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions applicable to the corresponding Company Option under the applicable
Company Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder,
including vesting terms.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU (other than any Company RSU
covered by  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(c)_) that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or
the holder thereof, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically
into and become a restricted stock unit covering shares of Parent Common
Stock (each, an " _Adjusted RSU_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that 

 



-16- 

    

 the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Adjusted RSU as
of the Effective Time will be determined by multiplying the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the corresponding Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, by the Offer Consideration, with any fractional
shares in the resulting product rounded down to the nearest whole share. Each
Adjusted RSU otherwise shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
applicable to the corresponding Company RSU under the applicable Company
Equity Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including vesting
terms.

 

(c) Each Former Service Provider Award shall not be treated in the manner set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ through  _(b)_ , and instead, at the
Effective Time, without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder thereof, shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined as: (i) (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Former Service Provider Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Offer
Consideration, _minus_ (ii) (A) the aggregate exercise or purchase price for
all shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Former Service Provider
Award divided by (B) the Parent Trading Price, with any resulting fractional
share rounded down to the nearest whole share. For the avoidance of doubt (x)
if the resulting difference between clause (i) minus clause (ii) in the
immediately preceding sentence is less than or equal to zero, then the Former
Service Provider Award will be terminated as of the Effective Time without
any consideration therefor and (y) each Company Equity Award held by a former
service provider of the Company or Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time that does not constitute a Former Service Provider Award
will be terminated as of the Effective Time without any consideration
therefor.

(d) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide
that: (i) with respect to any offering periods in effect as of the date hereof
(the " _Current ESPP Offering Periods_ "), no employee who is not a
participant in the Company ESPP as of the date hereof may become a participant
in the Company ESPP and no participant may increase his or her contributions
or payroll deductions under the Company ESPP after the date hereof; (ii)
subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP shall terminate
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP
Offering Periods terminate prior to the Effective Time, then the Company ESPP
shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced under the
Company ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement; and (iv) if any
Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the Effective Time, then
the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall be accelerated to a
date before the Closing Date as specified by the Company Board of Directors or
its designated committee.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions as are
necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity Awards and the Company ESPP
as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_.

(f) Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), to the extent such form is available, relating to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the

 



-17- 

    

 Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
statements for so long as Adjusted Options and Adjusted RSUs remain
outstanding.

Section 3.4. _Withholding_. Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser, the
Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under
the Code, or any other applicable Tax Law. Any such withholding may be
effected by reduction in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement, with each share of Parent Common Stock
valued for this purpose at the Parent Trading Price. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld, and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made.

Section 3.5. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by
the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock _multiplied_ by the Applicable
Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest cent.

operate their properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they

Section 4.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, each material Company Benefit Plan. Each offer letter for "at-
will" employment shall not be deemed a material Company Benefit Plan
_provided_ that such offer letter: (x) contains no severance or other
arrangements or obligations that would cause the offer letter to constitute a
material Company Benefit Plan, other than provisions for base salary or wages
and cash bonus or other cash incentive opportunity, in each case, that may be
modified by the Company at any time and from time to time in its sole
discretion and (y) may be terminated at any time without any liability of the
Company, other than payment of any accrued and unpaid base salary or wages.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Benefit Plan_ " means each
employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not
subject to ERISA, and each bonus, stock, stock option or other equity-based
compensation arrangement or plan, incentive, deferred compensation,
retirement or supplemental retirement, severance, employment, consulting,
change-in-control compensation, collective bargaining, profit sharing,
pension, vacation, cafeteria, dependent care, medical care, employee
assistance program, education or tuition assistance programs, and each
insurance and other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement, in each case, for the benefit of current or
former employees, directors or consultants (or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA
Affiliates or with respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has
or may reasonably be expected to have any obligation or liability (whether
actual or contingent). With respect to each material Company Benefit Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of (or, to

Subsidiaries, or their respective ERISA Affiliates, as applicable.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in accordance
with its terms and in compliance with applicable Law, including ERISA, the

No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not
been satisfied in full, and to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge no condition exists
that is likely to cause the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates to incur any such liability. All contributions or other
amounts payable by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to each
Company Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been
timely paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP or applicable
international accounting standards in all material respects. As of the date
hereof, there are no pending, or to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, threatened or
anticipated claims, actions, investigations or audits (other than routine
claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company Benefit
Plans or any trusts related thereto that would reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability.

ERISA Affiliates has maintained, established, sponsored, participated in,
contributed to or agreed to contribute to, or otherwise be part of any
employee benefit plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section
412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of

beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)

within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter as to its qualification and, to the

have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such plan. Each such favorable determination letter
has been provided or made available to Parent.

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will,
except as required by the terms of this Agreement, (i) result in any payment

Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase or decrease any benefits
otherwise payable under any Company Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any

Closing or in connection with the Transactions, excluding regular
administrative costs reasonably expected to be incurred in the
ordinary course of business as a result of the termination of any Company
Benefit Plan following the Closing), or (v) result in any payment (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual"
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) that
would, individually or in combination with any other such payment, reasonably
be expected to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

(h) Each Company Benefit Plan, if any, which is maintained for the benefit of
any current or former employees, directors or consultants of the Company or
Company Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates outside of the United

Section 4.14. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Company Intellectual Property_.

 

(i) Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list as of the date hereof of all of the Registered Intellectual
Property that, as of the date hereof is owned by, filed in the name of,
applied for by, or subject to a valid obligation of assignment to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, whether wholly or jointly owned by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (the " _Company Registered Intellectual Property_ "),
including any Registered Intellectual Property that has expired or lapsed or
has been abandoned or cancelled by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(ii) Section 4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter further lists for each
item of Company Registered Intellectual Property listed therein: (A) the
application or issuance number and title of such item and the jurisdiction in
which each has been filed or applied for; (B) whether such item is currently
subject to an application or has been issued; (C) any proceedings or actions
before any court, tribunal (including the United Stated Patent and Trademark
Office (the "PTO") or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) related
thereto (other than regular proceeding associated with the prosecution of an
application for Company Registered Intellectual Property); (D) the registered
owner of such Company Registered Intellectual Property and whether it is co-
owned with another Person, and if so, the name of such Person; and (E) any
action known to the Company as of the date hereof that must be taken within
ninety (90) days following the date hereof (including the payment of any
registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the filing of any responses to
office actions of the PTO or any equivalent authority anywhere in the world,
documents, applications or certificates) for the purposes of obtaining,
maintaining, perfecting or preserving or renewing any such Company
Registered Intellectual Property.

4.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter is, as of the date hereof, in
compliance with all formal legal requirements with respect to such
registration (including payment of filing, examination and maintenance fees,
and proofs of use, and recordations of assignments) and, to the extent
issued, is subsisting. The Company has not knowingly taken or knowingly failed
to take any action (including failure to disclose any information) that would
materially limit the

 



-33- 

    

 validity, scope or enforceability, as applicable, of any Patents or Patent
Applications that are (or would be but for such action or failure to take
action) Company Registered Intellectual Property, and to the CompanyÂ’s
Knowledge has prosecuted all such Company Registered Intellectual Property in
accordance with all applicable rules and requirements, including disclosure of
all pertinent and applicable information. All necessary documents and
certificates currently due for filing as of the date hereof in connection with
such Company Registered Intellectual Property have to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge
been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, or trademark office or other
authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be,
for the purposes of maintaining such Company Registered Intellectual Property.
None of the Company Registered Intellectual Property currently claims
"small entity status" in the application for or registration of such Company
Registered Intellectual Property. The Company has not abandoned or allowed to
lapse any Patents or Patent Applications that claims or covers (or would, but
for such abandonment or lapse) any aspect or feature of the Company Dry
Electrode Technology except to the extent that such aspect or feature is
adequately covered by other Patents or Patent Applications, as determined
within the CompanyÂ’s reasonable discretion. The Company solely owns each item
of Company Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Liens. To the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, no Proceeding (other than office
actions and similar items in connection with the prosecution of applications)
is pending or threatened by or before any Governmental Entity, that challenges
the legality, validity, enforceability, registration, use or ownership of any
Company Registered Intellectual Property.

 

(b) Except for Intellectual Property Rights which may not be assigned under
applicable Law and co-owned Intellectual Property listed in Section 4.14(a)

Subsidiary has granted or transferred (or is obligated to grant or transfer)
to any Person, or permitted (or is obligated to permit) any Person to retain,
an ownership interest, including any joint ownership interest, or any
exclusive rights in any Intellectual Property Rights that are or were Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

(i) No Proceedings are pending or, to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge, are threatened
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary alleging that the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is or was at any time infringing, misappropriating,
diluting or otherwise violating the Intellectual Property Rights of any Person
except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the conduct of
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, individually or in
the aggregate, and no such Proceeding has been brought or threatened in the
three (3) years prior to the date hereof that has not fully and finally
resolved.

 

(ii) Each Company Product (when used by or as authorized by the Company) and
the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
currently conducted, does not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate
any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person or constitute unfair
competition or unfair trade practices (and as conducted during the three (3)
years prior to the date hereof, has not infringed, violated, constituted, or
misappropriated any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person or constituted
unfair competition or unfair trade practices), _provided_ that the foregoing
warranties in this 

 



-34- 

    

 Section 4.14(d)(ii) are qualified to the CompanyÂ’s Knowledge with respect to
Trademarks, Patents and Patent Applications.

 

(iii) Since January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has instituted or threatened in writing to institute any Proceeding against
any Person alleging such Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting,
using in an unauthorized manner or otherwise violating any Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

 

(d) _Employees and Contractors_.

 

(i) In each case in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged or
hired an employee, consultant or contractor (whether current or former) for
the purpose of developing or creating any Company Registered Intellectual
Property or other Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the
business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Company or such Company
Subsidiary has obtained an assignment or transfer of all such Intellectual
Property Rights to the Company or such Company Subsidiary other than such
Intellectual Property Rights which are not assignable under applicable Law.
The Company and each Company Subsidiary have taken reasonable actions to
maintain and protect all Company Technology that derives independent economic
value, actual or potential, from not being known to other Persons, except (x)
for such Company Technology that the Company, in its reasonable business
judgement, determined that it no longer wanted to maintain as confidential, or
(y) as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the conduct of the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To
the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no unauthorized disclosure of
such Company Technology, or unauthorized disclosure by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary of any third party Technology. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have,
and take reasonable steps to enforce, a policy requiring employees,
consultants and independent contractors that have access to any such
Technology to execute a confidentiality agreement that obligates such Person
to maintain the confidentiality thereof.

(ii) No employee, consultant or contractor has retained or is entitled to any
rights in any Company Intellectual Property, other than such rights which the
employee, consultant or contractor is prohibited from assigning under
applicable Law. To the Knowledge of the Company, no current employee,
consultant or contractor of the Company, or Person engaged through a third
party agency, in all cases of the foregoing whose duties or responsibilities
are material to the CompanyÂ’s business is obligated under any agreement
(including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or subject to
any Proceeding or any other restriction that would materially interfere with
its, his or her duties for the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

(e) Other than Non-Scheduled Licenses, the Company has made available to
Parent prior to the date hereof true and in every material respect complete
copies of all material Contracts in effect as of the date hereof pursuant to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary (i) grants any license, covenant
not to assert, release, agreement not to enforce or

 



-35- 

    

 prosecute, or other immunity to any Person under or to any Company
Intellectual Property Rights (including under or to any Patent or Patent
Application), or (ii) is granted a license, covenant not to assert, release,
agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or immunity to or under any PersonÂ’s
Intellectual Property Rights (the foregoing, together with the Non-Scheduled
Licenses, the " _IP Contracts_ ").

(f) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the date hereof a true
and complete list of all material Company Products that were offered for
sale, sold, licensed, provided or distributed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof.

 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in (i) except as set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, a material breach or violation, or a modification, cancellation,
termination, or suspension of any IP Contract (other than any IP Contract that
is a Non-Scheduled License), (ii) the release of any Source Code that is
Company Technology or other material proprietary or confidential Company
Technology pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or a Company
Subsidiary is a party, or (iii) the grant, loss, or acceleration of (or
requirement to grant) any license, covenant not to assert, release, agreement
not to enforce or prosecute, option, or other immunity or right to any Company
Intellectual Property Rights (except for any such grants that may
be contained in a Non-Scheduled License) to any Person. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not result, as a result of any
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party as of the
Closing Date, (1) in the grant of (or requirement to grant) any license,
covenant not to assert, release, agreement not to enforce or prosecute, or
other immunity to any Intellectual Property Rights of Parent to any Person
or (2) Parent being subject to any non-compete, non-solicit, or other
restriction on the operation or scope of its business. Except as set forth in
Section 4.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, (1) all IP Contracts that
are material to the business of the Company individually and in the aggregate
shall remain in full force and effect following the Closing in accordance with
their terms (other than terminations or expirations occurring in the ordinary
course of business), and, (2) as of immediately after the Closing, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries will be entitled to exercise all of their
respective rights under all IP Contracts and to the Company Intellectual
Property to the same extent as prior to the Closing.

(h) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be material to the conduct
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or that alone or in the aggregate would be reasonably be expected to exceed
the applicable warranty reserve, no Proceeding by any Person is pending
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor has any of them received
any written claim or notice at any time during the three (3) years before the
Closing Date with respect to any warranty or indemnity claim relating to
any Company Products or with respect to the material breach of any IP
Contract under which such Company Products have been made available, in each
case, which remains unresolved as of the date hereof.

 

(i) _Standards Bodies Membership_. Except as listed on Section 4.14(i) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the "Standards Body Agreements"): (i) the Company
is not a

 



-36- 

    

 member of, and has not actively participated in, any organization, body or

-59-

committee thereof) shall not, and the Company shall cause the CompanyÂ’s
controlled affiliates not to, and it shall not authorize or permit its and
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of

Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) business days after the public disclosure
of such Acquisition Proposal (or subsequently withdraw, change, amend, modify

Proposal) and reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within such ten (10)
business day period (or, with respect to any material amendments, revisions
or changes to the terms of any such previously publicly disclosed Acquisition
Proposal that are publicly disclosed within the last five (5) business days
prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, fail to take the actions

commitment providing for, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.3_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (viii) commit or agree to do
any of the foregoing (any act described in clauses (iii), (iv), (v), (vi),
(vii) and/or (viii) (to the extent related to the foregoing clauses (iii),
(iv), (v), (vi) or (vii)), a " _Change of_ _Recommendation_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall be deemed to
prohibit the Company or its Representatives from stating to any Person that
the Company is not currently permitted to participate in discussions
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal). The Company and the Company Board
of Directors (including any committee thereof) shall, and the Company shall
cause the CompanyÂ’s controlled affiliates to, and shall cause its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease any and all solicitation,
encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any persons (or provision of
any nonpublic information to any persons) with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event
within two (2) business days following the date hereof), the Company shall (A)
request in writing that each person (other than Parent) that has heretofore
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal promptly destroy or
return to the Company all nonpublic information

 



-60- 

    

 heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such
person or any of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement and (B) terminate access to any physical or
electronic data rooms relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal by any such
person and its Representatives. The Company shall enforce, and not waive,
terminate or modify without ParentÂ’s prior written consent, any
confidentiality, standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality,
standstill or other agreement; _provided_ that, if the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the
CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel that the failure to waive a particular
standstill provision would reasonably be expected to be a breach of the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, with prior
written notice to Parent, waive such standstill solely to the extent
necessary to permit the applicable person (if the Company has not breached
this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_) to make, on a confidential basis to the Company
Board of Directors, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such person
agreeing to disclosure of such Acquisition Proposal to Parent, in each case as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
6.3_, the term "person" means any Person or "group," as defined in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary or any of their Representatives. For the avoidance of
doubt, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ by any of the CompanyÂ’s controlled affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives shall be a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by the
Company. For the avoidance of

doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any notices required to be made to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.3_ shall not, in and of themselves, be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, if
the Company has not breached this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and receives, prior to
the Acceptance Time, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, which the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith (i) after consultation
with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors constitutes a
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be a breach of the
directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may take
the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives), if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
the Company receives from such person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such information is provided or made available to
such person or its Representatives, any non-public information furnished to
such other person or its Representatives that was not previously furnished to
Parent, and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person and/or
its Representatives with respect to such Acquisition Proposal (and its
Representatives).

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent of any receipt by any director or officer of the Company
or by any of the CompanyÂ’s controlled affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal or any proposals or inquiries
that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the

 



-61- 

    

 Company or any Company Subsidiary by any person who has made or could
reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal (or of becoming aware
of any of its or their other affiliates having received any such Acquisition
Proposal, proposal, inquiry or request). Such notice shall indicate the
identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request
(unless prohibited by the terms of an existing confidentiality agreement),
and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the
nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request,
including unredacted copies of all written requests, correspondence, proposals
or offers, including proposed agreements received by the Company or, if such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written
description of the material terms and conditions thereof (it being understood
that the Company may withhold the identity of the person making the
Acquisition Proposal if prohibited by the terms of an existing confidentiality
agreement). Without limiting the CompanyÂ’s other obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
prompt and timely basis of the status and material terms (including any
amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms) of any such
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as to the nature of
any information requested of the Company with respect thereto and provide to
Parent copies of all written materials received or, if such information or
communication is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of
the material contents thereof (it being understood that the Company may
withhold the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal if
prohibited by the terms of an existing confidentiality agreement). Without
limiting the CompanyÂ’s other obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the
Company shall promptly provide (and in any event within the earlier of (i)
forty-eight (48) hours and (ii) one (1) business day) to Parent any material
nonpublic information concerning the Company provided to any other person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to
Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) inform
Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing information or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the Company shall not take any
action to exempt any person other than Parent or Purchaser from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover
Statute or in the Company Governing Documents, or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply. The Company agrees that it will not, directly or
indirectly, enter into any agreement with any person which directly or
indirectly prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to the contrary,
but subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, if the Company has not breached this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the Company
Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation (only of the type
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a))_ in response to an Intervening Event
if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be a breach of the directorsÂ’ fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (ii) make a Change of Recommendation and cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 9.1(g)_ in order to enter

 



-62- 

    

 into a definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Proposal, which the
Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors is a Superior
Proposal, but only if the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with the CompanyÂ’s outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be a breach of the directorsÂ’ fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter
into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1(g)_. " _Intervening Event_ "
means any event, change or development first occurring or arising after the
date hereof that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) and was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the
Company or the Company Board of Directors as of or prior to the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any of the following events,
changes or developments constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof or (B) changes in the market price or trading volume
of the Company Common Stock, the Parent Common Stock or any other securities
of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or any change in
credit rating or the fact that the Company meets or exceeds (or that Parent
fails to meet or exceed) internal or published estimates, projections,
forecasts or predictions for any period; (C) changes in general economic,
political or financial conditions or markets (including changes in interest
rates, exchange rates, stock, bond and/or debt prices); (D) changes in GAAP,
other applicable accounting rules or applicable Law or, in any such case,
changes in the interpretation thereof; (E) general changes or developments in
any of the industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate; (F)
natural disasters or calamities; (G) any outbreak or escalation of armed
hostilities, any acts of war or terrorism; (H) the announcement or pendency of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; or (I) any
litigation brought by or on behalf of any current or former Company
stockholder (in its capacity as such) arising from allegations of any breach
of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or
violation of securities Law related to the Offer Documents, the Schedule
14D-9 or any other document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
or required to be distributed or otherwise disseminated to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders in connection with the Offer and the Merger.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section_ __ _
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with five (5) business daysÂ’
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor,
and during such five (5) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to be available to
negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a
manner that would obviate the need to effect a Change of Recommendation and at
the end of such five (5) business day period the Company Board of Directors
again makes the determination under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(i)_ (after in good
faith taking into account any amendments proposed by Parent) or (ii) under
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with five (5)
business daysÂ’ prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board of
Directors intends to take such action and

 



-63- 

    

 specifying the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
including a copy of any proposed definitive documentation, and during such
five (5) business day period, the Company shall cause its Representatives
(including its executive officers) to be available to negotiate in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and at the end of such
five (5) business day period the Company Board of Directors again makes the
determination under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking
into account the amendments proposed by Parent). With respect to _Section_ __
_ 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any material amendments, revisions or changes to
the terms of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the
amount, form or mix of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as
a result of the Superior Proposal), the Company shall comply again with
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(ii)_.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
any similar statement in response to any publicly disclosed Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that any "stop, look and listen" statement, or any such
similar statement, also includes an express reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ shall
not permit the Company Board of Directors to make (or otherwise modify the
definition of) a Change of Recommendation except to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and ParentÂ’s
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to the CompanyÂ’s and the Company SubsidiariesÂ’
offices, properties, Contracts, personnel, books and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to,

ParentÂ’s Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i) that is
prohibited from disclosure pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date hereof that is
still in effect, (ii) the disclosure of which would violate Law ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of Law) or (iii) the disclosure of which would

 



-64- 

    

 violate or invalidate any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such disclosure to the maximum
extent that does not result in a loss of such attorney-client, attorney work
product or other legal privilege; and _provided_ , _further_ , that such
access and information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to
counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of
obtaining required approvals or consents, or making filings or providing
notices, subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense
agreement in customary form). Parent will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize to the extent reasonably practicable any unnecessary
disruption to the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that
may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its

otherwise relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, (iii)
upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or

Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable or which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the
consummation of the Transactions and (iv) upon becoming aware of any Specified
Employee communicating his or her intention to terminate, or providing notice
of termination of, his or her employment with the Company, Company
Subsidiaries, or their respective ERISA Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring
disclosure of such matter or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to such Party.

 

Section 7.2. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to

all other Antitrust Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
to, and the Company may not and may not permit any Subsidiary to, without the
prior written consent of Parent, become subject to, consent to or offer or
agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order to (A) sell, license,
assign, transfer, divest, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets,

Parent, Purchaser or any Subsidiary of any of the foregoing, (B) conduct,

to, consent to or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect
to, any such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or
order so long as such requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order is only binding on the Company or its Subsidiaries in the
event the Closing occurs.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with and without
limiting the efforts referenced in  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ to obtain all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for
the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate
in all respects and consult with each other in connection with any filing or

such press release or other public announcement or disclosure with respect to
the Offer, the Merger, the other Transactions or this Agreement, in which
event the Company shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the

court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable judgment
that such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, investigation, suit or
proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the

whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in
connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee or
other fiduciary of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or of any other
Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company
or any Subsidiary to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the
Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of the applicable
Company Subsidiary (as applicable) or any indemnification agreements with such
persons in existence on the date of this Agreement and provided to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents
and (ii) any indemnification agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
with any Indemnified Party in existence on the date of this Agreement and
provided to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent
such agreement provides for an earlier termination, in each case, regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees
and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date hereof, and no
such provision shall be amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified
Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions).

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on such "tail"
policy, in the aggregate, more than two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of
the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof
for the CompanyÂ’s current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base Amount_ "), and if
the cost of such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the Base Amount, the
Company shall be permitted to purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for the Base Amount. The Company shall in good faith cooperate
with Parent prior to the Acceptance Time with respect to the procurement of
such "tail" policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker,

and the other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tender
and Support Agreements) may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions. No Change of Recommendation shall change, or be deemed to
change, or permit the Company or the Company Board of Directors to change, in
any manner or respect the approval of the Company Board of Directors for
purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger or
any of the other Transactions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Tender and Support Agreements).

Section 7.6. _Obligations of Purchaser_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Purchaser and the Surviving Company to perform their

satisfactory to Parent that the Terminating Equity Plans and such 401(k)

Equity Plans and the CompanyÂ’s 401(k) Plans, the Company shall provide Parent
with the form and substance of any applicable resolutions for review and
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Prior to the 401(k) Termination Date, the Company shall take any
and all actions with respect to the 401(k) Plans as Parent may reasonably
request, including, without limitation, making any amendments to the 401(k)
Plan(s) or any loan policy or other arrangements under the 401(k) Plan(s) to
provide for and enable appropriate in-kind rollover of outstanding participant
loans under the 401(k) Plans to ParentÂ’s 401(k) plans.

 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee of the Company or
Company Subsidiary who continues to be employed by Parent or any Subsidiary
thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") any right to continue in the employ
or service of Parent or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent or any affiliate of Parent, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written
agreement between Parent, the Company or any affiliate of Parent and the
Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan or
program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in

(i) be deemed or

 



-70- 

    

 construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit
Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or Purchaser or (ii) create any third
party rights in any current or former service provider of the Company or its
affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

(c) Parent shall accept all immigration and visa obligations and liabilities
with respect to any Continuing Employees. Such obligations may include

processing or providing visas, applications for residency, U.S. work permits,
and other governmental authorization to work in the United States to
Continuing Employees, as well as a list of all Continuing Employees who are
currently permitted to work for the Company pursuant to a visa and the
specific type of visa each such Continuing Employee holds. The Company shall,

their respective directors or officers relating to the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other Transactions or this Agreement, and shall keep
Parent informed on a prompt and timely basis with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate (at
ParentÂ’s expense) in the defense or settlement of any such litigation and
reasonably cooperate with Parent in conducting the defense or settlement of
such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed without ParentÂ’s prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, (it being understood that Parent shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of Parent and
its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable relief after
the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates). In the event of,
and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall control.

(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Common
Stock and holders of Company Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee of the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (a) at
a meeting to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, has duly adopted or will
duly adopt resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)

respective covenants or agreements under this Agreement or (B) any of the

breached, failed to perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this
Agreement or (B) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of
clauses (A) or (B) in a manner that would give rise to the right of Parent and
Purchaser not to accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to clause (F)(1) or (F)(2) of _Annex_ __ _ C_ (assuming the
expiration of the Offer as of such time) and such breach, failure to perform,

1.1(f)(ii)_) without Purchaser having accepted for payment any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(A)_ shall not

 automatically extended by the number of business days that equals the lesser

February 22, 2019 and the Offer Date; _provided_ _further_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(B)_ shall
not be available to any Party whose action or failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been a proximate cause of the failure of
the Acceptance Time to occur by the Outside Date and such action or failure to
act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

 

(e) by Parent, if, prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the CompanyÂ’s Board of
Directors shall have effected a Change of Recommendation or (ii) the Company
has materially breached _Section_ __ _ 6.3_;

(f) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final, non-appealable order, injunction,

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in

other Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
and _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ through _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ shall survive such
termination; _provided_ that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from
liability for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful breach_ " shall mean
an action taken or a failure to act that the breaching party intentionally
takes (or fails to take) and has actual knowledge that such action or such
failure to act would, or would reasonably be expected to, be or cause a
material breach of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_, (B) after the date hereof and prior to the date of
such termination, an Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company or the
Company Stockholders or otherwise becomes publicly disclosed (whether by the
Company or a third party) and is not withdrawn (and publicly withdrawn for any
Acquisition Proposal that was publically disclosed) for at least three (3)
business days prior to such termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months of
such

 



-75- 

    

 termination, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive
agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into, then, on
the date that such Acquisition Proposal is consummated (even if such
Acquisition Proposal is consummated after such twelve (12) month period), the
Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $8,295,000 in cash (the " _Termination
Fee_ "). Solely for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)(i)_, the term
"Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Annex_
__ _ A_, except that all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" and "eighty
five percent (85%)" therein shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)."

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _ Section_ __ _
9.1(e)_ within two (2) business days after such termination, the Company shall
pay to Parent the Termination Fee.

 

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.1(g)_, substantially concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to)
such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent the
Termination Fee.

(iv) In the event any amount is payable by the Company pursuant to the
preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such amount shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent. Parent shall promptly provide wire transfer instructions in writing
to the Company upon request (and in any event with sufficient time to allow
the Company to pay or cause to be paid to Parent any Termination Fee payable
hereunder within the time periods required by this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_).
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, the Parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. Each Party
further acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, if the Company fails to pay
in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, then
(i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue
amounts, including in connection with any related claims, actions or
proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ from and including the
date payment of such amounts were due to but excluding the date of actual
payment at the prime rate set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made. Notwithstanding anything to

Section 10.5. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" shall
have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. The word
"extent" and the

 



-78- 

    

 phrase "to the extent" when used in this Agreement shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other things extends, and such word or phrase shall not
merely mean "if." The term "or" is not exclusive. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement," "the date hereof," "of even date herewith" and terms of
similar import, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble
to this Agreement. The phrase "made available to Parent," "delivered to
Parent," "provided to Parent" or similar phrases as used with reference to
documents or other materials required to be delivered, provided or
made available to Parent in this Agreement shall mean (unless context clearly
indicates otherwise) that the subject documents were posted to the virtual
data room at least one (1) business day prior to the date of this Agreement or
were contained in, attached to or referenced by the Company SEC Documents.
The table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement or any schedule
delivered pursuant to this Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes
only and shall not affect or be deemed to affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or such schedule or any term or provision
hereof or thereof. All references herein to the Subsidiaries of a Person shall
be deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. The Parties
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any Law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

Section 10.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed manually or by
facsimile or by other electronic transmission by the Parties, in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when a counterpart hereof shall have been signed by
each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. The exchange of a
fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the
Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement; Third-party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, Parent
and Purchaser shall be permitted to take the actions contemplated by this
Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties or any
of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, nothing in this
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter) or in the Confidentiality Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies
hereunder or thereunder.

 



-79- 

    

Section 10.8. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse
to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Offer and the Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 10.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court

thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such
court finds it lacks jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof; (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
action or proceeding in such courts; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.9(b)_ in
the manner provided for notices in _Section_ __ _ 10.4_. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law.

Section 10.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
OFFER, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER

 



-80- 

    

 TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __
_ 10.10_.

 

Section 10.11. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior

be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.12. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_, each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or order of specific performance specifically enforcing the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The PartiesÂ’ rights in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ are an integral part of
the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ (including any objection on the
basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the
avoidance of doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at
Law for a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks
any remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.12_, such Party shall not
be required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.
