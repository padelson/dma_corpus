notice from  FNANB,  which  notice  shall  provide  detailed  information  about
inconsistent  usage of the FNANB  Credit Card  Marks,  cease any act or practice
that in FNANB's good faith  reasonable  opinion could  reasonably be expected to

     (f) FNANB shall  contact the Trustee  prior to the Closing Date and request

all interest and other investment earnings  attributable to amounts deposited by
FNANB into the  Collection  Account on or before the Closing Date (to the extent
such  interest and other  investment  earnings were not  distributed  on a prior
Distribution Date). If the Trustee makes such payment,  the amount paid shall be
included  in  calculating  the  amount  to be  paid  to  Sellers  under  Section
2.09(b)(iv). If the Trustee does not make such payment, on the Distribution Date
in the second month following the Closing Month,  Purchaser shall pay to Sellers
an amount equal to the amount paid to Purchaser  (as holder of the  Exchangeable
Transferor  Certificate) on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.1(b) of
the  Pooling  and  Servicing   Agreement   (less  any  portion  of  such  amount

and other investment  earnings on funds on deposit in the Collection Account are
allocated correctly between Purchaser and Sellers.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                     CLOSING

     SECTION 3.01.  The Closing.  The closing of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby (the  "Closing")  shall take place (i) subject to Article XI, as promptly
as  practicable  when the last of the  conditions  required to be  satisfied  or
waived pursuant to Article IX is either satisfied or waived (other than any such
condition that this Agreement contemplates may be satisfied at the Closing), and
(ii) at 10:00 a.m.  Eastern  Time at the offices of  McGuireWoods  LLP, 901 East
Cary  Street,  Richmond,  VA 23219,  or at such  other time or place and in such

                                       28

other  manner  (including  via  facsimile)  as may be mutually  agreed to by the
Parties hereto;  provided,  however, that the Closing Date shall occur after the
Distribution  Date in the Closing  Month  (such time and date being  referred to
herein as the "Closing  Time" and the "Closing  Date,"  respectively).  Upon the
Closing,  Purchaser  shall own the Purchased  Assets as of the Closing Date, and
shall assume and perform and  discharge,  in  accordance  with their  respective
terms, the Assumed Liabilities.  Thereafter,  Circuit City and the Sellers shall
have  no  further  income  participation  or  ownership  interest  in any of the
Purchased Assets.

     SECTION 3.02. Valuation Date Statements.

     (a) Not later than ten (10)  Business  Days prior to the Closing  Date (the
"Preliminary  Valuation Date"), FNANB shall deliver to Purchaser the Preliminary
Valuation Date  Statement,  along with sufficient  reports and other  supporting
calculations  so as to verify  the  calculations  set  forth in the  Preliminary
Valuation  Date  Statement,  calculated as of the  Preliminary  Valuation  Date.
Purchaser  shall  have the  right  to  review  the  Preliminary  Valuation  Date
Statement,  together  with any  supporting  documents  reasonably  requested  by
Purchaser to verify the accuracy and  completeness of the computations set forth
therein,  and the  Preliminary  Valuation  Date  Statement  shall be  revised to
reflect any modifications thereto mutually agreed to by Purchaser and FNANB.

     (b) Not later than three (3)  Business  Days prior to the Closing Date (the
"Subsequent  Valuation  Date"),  FNANB shall deliver to Purchaser the Subsequent
Valuation Date  Statement,  along with sufficient  reports and other  supporting
calculations  so as to  verify  the  calculations  set  forth in the  Subsequent
Valuation Date Statement, calculated as of the Subsequent Valuation Date. In the
event that the Subsequent Valuation Date Statement deviates from the Preliminary
Valuation Date Statement by less than five percent (5%),  then the Closing shall
occur based on the Subsequent  Valuation Date  Statement.  In the event that the
Subsequent Valuation Date Statement deviates from the Preliminary Valuation Date
Statement  by more than five  percent,  then the Parties  shall  attempt in good
faith to resolve any such deviation.  If FNANB and Purchaser are unable to reach
an agreement  as to such  deviation on or prior to the day prior to the Closing,
the Closing  shall occur based on the lesser of the  valuation  set forth in the
Preliminary Valuation Date Statement and the Subsequent Valuation Date Statement
and the dispute shall be resolved and the  Subsequent  Valuation  Date Statement
shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with Section 4.04.

     SECTION 3.03. Payments on the Closing Date.

     (a) If either  Outstanding  Private  Series is  outstanding at the close of
business on the Distribution  Date  immediately  preceding the Closing Date, the
Parties shall  jointly  select and engage an escrow agent to accept and transfer
payments pursuant to this Section 3.03(a). Purchaser and Sellers shall each bear
one-half of any fees or charges  assessed by the escrow agent.  Purchaser  shall
pay to the escrow agent, at the Closing  (subject to satisfaction of the closing
conditions set forth in Article IX (including satisfaction of Section 9.02(h) by
establishing  a procedure in accordance  with this Section  3.03(a) by which the
Outstanding  Private  Series  will be paid in full on the  Closing  Date)),  the
Purchase  Price set forth in the  appropriate  Valuation  Date  Statement as set
forth in Section  3.02.  The Parties  shall cause the escrow agent to apply such
payment, in each case on the Closing Date, (i) first, to pay the

                                       29

Outstanding Private Series in full and (ii) second, upon receiving  confirmation
that the  Outstanding  Private  Series have been paid in full, to pay FNANB (for
the account of Sellers and Circuit  City) the portion of the Purchase  Price not
applied to pay the  Outstanding  Private Series in full. The Parties shall cause
the escrow agent to make the payments described in clauses (i) and (ii) above by
wire transfer of immediately available dollars to accounts designated in writing
by FNANB.  FNANB shall provide the escrow agent with wire  instructions no later
than two (2) Business  Days prior to the Closing  Date.  The Parties  shall work
together  to  ensure  that  any  amendments  to  the  documents  related  to the
Outstanding  Private Series and the procedure by which the  Outstanding  Private
Series  are  paid  in full do not  cause  the  Trust  to  fail to  qualify  as a
qualifying  special  purpose entity under  applicable  accounting  guidelines in
effect  on the  date of this  Agreement.  If there  is a  change  in  applicable
accounting  guidelines  between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Sellers and Circuit City shall take such reasonable  actions as may be requested
by Purchaser to ensure that such  amendments and such procedure do not cause the
Trust to fail to qualify  as a  qualifying  special  purpose  entity  under such
changed accounting guidelines (it being understood that Sellers and Circuit City
shall  only be  obligated  to take such  actions  as they  would  reasonably  be
expected to take to  maintain  the status of the Trust as a  qualifying  special
purpose entity if this Agreement were not in effect).

     (b) If the  Outstanding  Private Series have been paid in full on or before
the Distribution  Date immediately  preceding the Closing Date,  Purchaser shall
pay FNANB (for the account of Circuit City and Sellers), at the Closing (subject
to satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Article IX), the Purchase
Price set forth in the  appropriate  Valuation  Date  Statement  as set forth in
Section  3.02.  Purchaser  shall  make  such  payment  by  a  wire  transfer  of
immediately  available  dollars  to an account  designated  in writing by FNANB.
FNANB  shall  provide  Purchaser  with wire  instructions  no later than two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

     SECTION 3.04.  Proceedings at Closing.  All proceedings to be taken and all
documents  to be executed and  delivered by the Parties at the Closing  shall be
deemed to have been taken and executed simultaneously,  and, except as permitted
hereunder,  no proceeding shall be deemed taken, payment made, nor any documents
executed and delivered until all have been taken, made, executed, and delivered.

     SECTION 3.05.  Delivery of Books and Records.  Except as otherwise provided
in the Transition  Services  Agreement and subject to all  Requirements  of Law,
FNANB shall deliver the Books and Records to Purchaser on the Closing Date or as
soon as practicable thereafter, but, in any event, FNANB shall deliver the Books
and Records to  Purchaser  no later than five (5) days after the  expiration  or
termination of the Transition Services Agreement;  provided,  that any Books and
Records  located at the Leased Real Property or the FNANB  facility in Richmond,
Virginia,  or included in  electronic  files  transferred  to  Purchaser  on the
Closing  Date  shall be  deemed to be  delivered  by FNANB to  Purchaser  on the
Closing Date.

     SECTION 3.06. Transfer of Absolute Title; Filing of Financing Statements.

     (a)  The  Parties   intend  that,  for  all  purposes,   the   transactions
contemplated  hereby  shall be treated as a purchase  and sale of the  Purchased
Assets.  Upon  Purchasers'  purchase of the  Purchased  Assets  pursuant to this
Agreement, all of Sellers' right, title and interest therein shall

                                       30

be  transferred  to Purchaser or its  permitted  assigns as provided in Sections
2.01 and 2.02.  It is the express  intent of the Parties that the  conveyance of
the Purchased Assets by Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant hereto be construed as
a  purchase  and  sale,  free and  clear of all  Liens or  adverse  claims,  for
accounting, regulatory, tax and all other purposes, other than Permitted Liens.

     (b) To the extent that any Seller retains any interest in Purchased  Assets
that  constitute   "Accounts,"  "Account   Documentation,"   "Indebtedness"  (as
"Accounts,"  "Account  Documentation"  and  "Indebtedness"  are  defined  in the
Program Agreement and referred to herein collectively, including any proceeds of
any of these, as the "Secured Assets") it is the intention of the parties hereto
that this Agreement shall constitute a security  agreement under applicable law,
and such Seller  hereby  grants to the  Purchaser a security  interest in all of
such Seller's  right,  title and interest,  in, to and under the Secured  Assets
conveyed  by such  Seller to secure a loan in an amount  equal to the portion of
the Purchase Price  allocable to such Secured Assets.  Sellers hereby  authorize
Purchaser to file,  and Sellers  shall  cooperate  with  Purchaser in preparing,
financing   statements  (the  "Financing   Statements")   and  any  continuation
statements  and  amendments  thereto  in all  jurisdictions  and with all filing
offices as Purchaser may  reasonably  determine are necessary or  appropriate to
protect  the  interest  of  Purchaser  in  the  Secured  Assets.  The  Financing
Statements  may  describe  the Secured  Assets in the same  manner as  described
herein or may contain an indication or description of collateral  that describes
such property in a manner as Purchaser may reasonably  determine is necessary or
appropriate  to ensure the  perfection  of a security  interest  in the  Secured
Assets in favor of Purchaser.  Following  filing of the Financing  Statements in
such  jurisdictions  as  Purchaser  may  reasonably  determine  is  necessary or
appropriate to fully preserve, maintain and protect the interest of Purchaser in
the Secured Assets,  Purchaser shall provide FNANB with file-stamped  copies of,
or filing receipts for, such Financing Statements as soon as available following
such filing.

     SECTION  3.07.  Power  of  Attorney.  Effective  upon  consummation  of the
Closing, FNANB hereby irrevocably names, constitutes, and appoints Purchaser and
any of Purchaser's  officers,  agents,  employees,  or representatives  its duly
authorized  attorney  and agent with full power and  authority to (i) endorse in
FNANB's name any check,  draft, or other  instrument of payment  relating to the
Accounts,  including  through the use of a rubber  stamp with the  signature  of
FNANB  thereon,  (ii)  receive  and  collect  any and all  monies due under such
Accounts,  and (iii) enforce  performance of all Purchased  Assets  purchased by
Purchaser  pursuant to this  Agreement.  The power of  attorney  granted by this
provision is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                     POST-CLOSING PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS

     SECTION 4.01. Accounts-Based Adjustments.

     (a) The parties agree that the Purchase  Price paid at the Closing shall be
adjusted in accordance with Section 4.02 and/or Section 4.03, as applicable,  if
any of the  following  events  shall occur  (collectively,  the  "Accounts-Based
Adjustments"): (i) Purchaser is paid by VISA and/or Circuit City or Circuit City
West Coast, Inc. after the Cut-Off Time for a chargeback in

                                       31

respect of which FNANB  provided a Borrower a credit on an Account  prior to the
Cut-Off  Time;  (ii) a check  from a Borrower  in payment of amounts  owed on an
Account,  which was  credited  to such  Account  prior to the Cut-Off  Time,  is
returned unpaid by the drawee after the Cut-Off Time;  (iii) Purchaser  receives
Interchange  related to  transactions  occurring  before the Cut-Off Time;  (iv)
Purchaser provides a credit on an Account with respect to Unauthorized Use of an
Account prior to the Closing Date; (v) Purchaser provides a credit on an Account
in connection  with a transaction  posted before the Cut-Off Time as a result of
rights   asserted  by  the  Borrower  under  12  CFR   ss.226.12(c)  or  12  CFR
ss.226.13(d);  (vi) Purchaser charges off an Account after the Cut-Off Time that
Sellers'  charge-off  policy  required to be charged off by Sellers on or before
the  Cut-Off  Time or that  such  policy,  in the  absence  of the  transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement,  would have required to be charged off based on
an event that occurred on or before the Cut-Off Time;  (vii) the Purchaser  pays
VISA fees for activities  occurring prior to the Cut-Off Time; or (viii) Circuit
City or Sellers receive a payment or other amount prior to the Cut-Off Time, but
such payment or amount is not posted until after the Cut-Off Time. An adjustment
to the  Purchase  Price  shall be made in favor of FNANB  (in the case of clause
(i), (ii) or (iii)) or Purchaser (in the case of clause (iv), (v), (vi),  (vii),
or (viii))  in the  amount of such  chargeback,  check,  Interchange,  credit or
payment, as the case may be.

     (b)  Purchaser  shall pay any  charge-back  or credit  with  respect to the
pre-Cut-Off  Time account  activity of the Accounts;  provided  that,  Purchaser
shall pay only for those aforesaid  liabilities that are submitted and processed
at all times  within  the  required  time  periods  prescribed  by,  and in full
accordance  with  both  (i) all  Requirements  of Law  and  (ii)  the  Operating
Regulations.

     SECTION 4.02. Settlement Date Adjustments.

     (a)  Settlement  Date  Statement.  At least  thirty  (30) days prior to the
Settlement  Date,  Purchaser shall deliver to FNANB a statement (the "Settlement
Date  Statement")  setting  forth (i) the Purchase  Price,  calculated as of the
Cut-Off Time,  along with  applicable  supporting  calculations  for the Accrued
Interest and (ii) the aggregate amount of any  Accounts-Based  Adjustments as to
which  Purchaser has Knowledge as of the date of such Settlement Date Statement.
Purchaser agrees that it shall provide to FNANB mutually  acceptable  supporting
documentation  in a mutually  agreed  format and  accompanied  by a file  layout
relied upon in determining  the Purchase  Price and the aggregate  amount of any
Accounts-Based Adjustments set forth in the Settlement Date Statement. Purchaser
shall  deliver,  or cause to be  delivered,  to FNANB the Final  Closing Tape no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the Settlement Date.

     (b)  Payments  on the  Settlement  Date.  On the  Settlement  Date,  if the
Adjusted  Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser on
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall remit the difference to Circuit City, together
with  interest on such amount at the Federal  Funds Rate divided by 360 for each
day during the period from and  including  the Closing Date to but excluding the
Settlement Date. If the Adjusted  Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price
paid by  Purchaser  on the  Closing  Date,  FNANB (on behalf of itself and Tyler
Funding) shall remit the difference to Purchaser  together with interest on such
amount at the Federal  Funds Rate  divided by 360 for each day during the period
from and  including  the Closing  Date to but  excluding  the  Settlement  Date.
Payments  on the  Settlement  Date  shall be  remitted  no later than 10:00 a.m.
Eastern Time by a wire transfer of immediately available dollars to an account

                                       32

designated in writing by the Party to which  payment is due.  Wire  instructions
shall be forwarded to the paying Party no later than two (2) Business Days prior
to the Settlement Date.

     SECTION 4.03.  Post-Settlement Date Adjustments.  If facts or circumstances
arise after the date of the Settlement Date Statement but on or before the 150th
day  after  the  Closing  Date  that  give  rise  to  additional  Accounts-Based
Adjustments,  then,  after the Settlement Date, in accordance with Section 4.01,
the Parties agree that a further adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price shall
be made in favor of Sellers or Purchaser,  as  applicable,  in the amount of the
chargeback, check, Interchange, credit or payment, as the case may be, resulting
in any such  Accounts-Based  Adjustment.  The Party with  knowledge of the facts
relating  to the  facts  or  circumstances  giving  rise to such  Accounts-Based
Adjustment  shall  provide to the other  Party  written  notice  and  supporting
documentation (to the extent available to such Party) as promptly as practicable
after discovering such facts or circumstances, and in any case within 30 days of
the discovery  thereof.  FNANB (or Circuit City on its behalf) or Purchaser,  as
the case may be,  shall,  within five Business Days after receipt of said notice
or the resolution of any dispute related thereto in accordance with Section 4.04
(but in no event  earlier than five Business  Days after the  Settlement  Date),
reimburse  the  other  Party to which  such  payment  is  owed,  in  immediately
available funds,  for the amount of said  adjustment,  together with interest on
the  reimbursed   amount   computed  from  the  Closing  Date  to  the  date  of
reimbursement at an interest rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate divided by 360
for each day during such period.

     SECTION  4.04.  Resolution  of Disputes.  The Parties  agree that (i) FNANB
shall  have the right to  dispute  any  calculation  or amount  set forth in the
Settlement  Date  Statement  and (ii) any Party may dispute any  calculation  or
amount  contained in a written notice delivered by any other Party in accordance
with Section 4.03. If a Party wishes to dispute any such calculations, the Party
disputing such  calculation  shall deliver a written notice to the other Parties
within ten (10) Business  Days of receipt of the  Settlement  Date  Statement or
notice  pursuant  to  Section  4.03,  as  the  case  may  be,   specifying  with
particularity the disputed amounts.  Thereafter,  the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith for a period of up to fifteen (15)  Business Days to resolve any such
dispute.  If such dispute is not resolved  within such fifteen (15) Business Day
period,  then the Parties shall,  within ten (10) Business Days after the end of
such fifteen (15) Business Day period,  jointly  retain a mutually  agreed upon,
nationally  recognized  independent public accounting firm (the "Accountant") to
reconcile any financial items in dispute. The Accountant shall not have provided
services to Circuit City or its  Affiliates  or to Bank One  Corporation  or its
Affiliates  during the preceding 12 months.  The Accountant shall be required to
complete its  assessment  within  fifteen (15) Business Days and the findings of
the Accountant shall be final and binding upon the parties without any rights of
appeal.  Each of Purchaser and its Affiliates  and Sellers and their  Affiliates
shall  cooperate  fully in assisting the Accountant in its review,  including by
providing the Accountant with reasonable  access during normal business hours to
all  files,  books,  and  records  relevant  thereto  and  providing  such other

passage of time would constitute a Series 2002-1 Early  Amortization  Event or a
Series 2003-2 Early  Amortization  Event,  and no event or condition exists that
constitutes  or is reasonably  likely to constitute a Servicer  Default or other
similar  event   permitting   the   termination   of  the  Servicer   under  the
Securitization  Documents.  Assuming the consents and  approvals  referred to in
Section  5.04  are  obtained  and the  Securitization  Transfer  Agreements  and
Required  Securitization  Amendments  are validly  executed and delivered by the
parties thereto,  the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will
not cause the occurrence of any such early amortization event, Servicer Default,
or other similar  event,  or any event that with either notice or the passage of
time would constitute any such early amortization  event,  Servicer Default,  or
other similar event, nor shall such consummation or the receipt of such required
consents   in   connection   therewith   trigger  any   requirement   under  any
Securitization  Document  to fund an  increase  in any spread  account,  reserve
account or similar  account,  or any draw on any such account under the terms of
any  Securitization  Document or to otherwise  increase  any credit  enhancement
required under the Securitization Documents.

     (i) The  Outstanding  Series and the  Exchangeable  Transferor  Certificate
represent the entire  interest in the Trust.  Tyler Funding is the sole owner of
the Securitization  Retained  Interests.  The Trust is not, and will not be as a
result of the transfer of the  Purchased  Assets,  an  association  taxable as a
corporation for federal income tax purposes.

     (j)  There  are no  pending  or,  to the  Knowledge  of  FNANB,  threatened
proceedings,   stop  orders,   lawsuits,  or  administrative   actions  alleging
violations  of the  Securities  Act or the Exchange Act relating to the Trust or
any Outstanding Series.

     (k) All  contracts  relating  to the  Outstanding  Private  Series  will be
completely  terminated  on  or  before  the  Closing  Date.  The  Securitization
Documents and the Tyler Funding  Interest Rate Caps will  constitute  all of the
contracts  relating to the Trust to which the Trust is a party as of the Closing
Date (after giving effect to the  termination  of the contracts  relating to the
Outstanding  Private  Series).  The  transfer of the  Purchased  Assets does not
violate federal or state securities laws and is not a transaction required to be
registered under the Securities Act.

     (l) No  interests  in the Trust have been  issued  since April 25, 2003 (it
being  understood  that an increase  in the  Invested  Amount of an  Outstanding
Private Series shall not constitute the issuance of an interest in the Trust for
purposes of this paragraph).

     (m) The  Exchangeable  Transferor  Certificate,  the Series 2002-1 Retained
Certificates and the Series 2003-2 Retained  Certificates are valid, binding and
enforceable  obligations  of the Trust,  except as  enforcement  thereof  may be
subject to bankruptcy,  receivership,  insolvency,  moratorium,  reorganization,
fraudulent  transfer or similar laws affecting the  enforcement of the rights of
creditors from time to time in effect.

                                       42

     (n) The Trust  qualifies  as a  qualifying  special  purpose  entity  under
applicable accounting guidelines in effect on the date of this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.14.  Effective  Transfer.  Except as set forth in Section 5.14 of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, FNANB or Tyler Funding collectively are the sole
owners of and control good and marketable title to the Purchased Assets free and
clear of any Liens  (other  than  Permitted  Liens).  Upon  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  at the  Closing,  including  the
execution  and  delivery  of the  documents  to be  delivered,  at  the  Closing
Purchaser  or its  permitted  assigns  shall be vested with good and  marketable
title in and to the  Purchased  Assets,  free and  clear  of all  Liens,  except
Permitted Liens, and the Securitization  Transfer Agreements,  when executed and
delivered to Purchaser at the Closing,  shall  constitute a valid  assignment of
FNANB's  interests  in the  Servicer  Rights and in FNANB's and Tyler  Funding's
rights and, to the extent specified  therein,  obligations in the Securitization
Documents and the Tyler Funding Interest Rate Caps  enforceable  against each of
FNANB and Tyler Funding,  upon the filing of the Financing  Statements,  against
all other Persons.  Sellers have taken no action to impair Purchaser's rights in
the Purchased Assets or to prevent Purchaser from collecting the Receivables.

     SECTION 5.15.  Ratings.  None of the Rating  Agencies has indicated that it
has under  surveillance  or review its rating of any of the  Outstanding  Series
and, to the Knowledge of Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding,  there exists no
circumstance  or condition  reasonably  likely to cause any rating of any of the
Outstanding  Series to be  modified,  qualified,  lowered  or placed  under such
surveillance.

     SECTION 5.16. Books and Records.  The Books and Records with respect to the
Accounts  accurately reflect the terms and conditions of the Accounts.  No third
party has rights to use or market  the  information  contained  in the Books and
Records and the Borrower List.

     SECTION  5.17.  Exchange Act Reports.  The Trust has filed with the SEC all
forms,  reports and other documents  required to be filed by the Trust under the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (other than any
such  form,  report or other  document  required  to be filed  with  respect  to
Investor  Certificates paid in full on or before the Closing Date)]. As of their
respective filing dates, such forms, reports and other documents complied in all
material  respects with all applicable  requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder,  as modified by no-action positions
of the SEC  relating  to credit  card  securitizations,  and did not  contain an
untrue  statement  of any  material  fact or omit to  state  any  material  fact
necessary to make the statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under
which they were made,  not  misleading;  provided,  however,  that the foregoing
representation  shall  not  apply to any  statement  that has been  modified  or
superseded by any statement in a subsequently filed document.  Sellers have been
advised that the Class A Floating Rate Asset Backed Certificates, Series 2002-1,
and the Class A Floating Rate Asset Backed  Certificates,  Series  2003-2,  were
owned,  in each case at the conclusion of the offering of such  certificates  to
the  public,  by 100 or  more  investors  independent  of the  Trust  and of one
another.   The  Trust   registered  the  Class  A  Floating  Rate  Asset  Backed
Certificates,  Series  2002-1,  under the Exchange Act within 120 days after the
fiscal year of the Trust during which the

                                       43

offering of such certificates to the public occurred,  and such registration has
not been suspended or terminated.

     SECTION 5.18.  Approval and Authorization.  FNANB has received or given any
and all consents,  licenses,  approvals or authorizations of or registrations or
declarations  with any Governmental  Authority of the United States or any state
("Authorizations")  required  to be  obtained,  effected  or  given  by FNANB to
originate,  own and  operate  the  Accounts.  All  Accounts  have been  properly
accounted  for and all payments or monies  received by FNANB with respect to the
payment of any  Receivable  have been  properly  applied.  Each Account has been
properly originated,  maintained and serviced in all material respects solely by
FNANB or TSYS in a manner  consistent with any standard and customary  practices
utilized by prudent  lenders  engaged in the business of lending  money  through
credit card accounts.  Each Seller has received all  Authorizations  required to
conduct the Credit Card Business as conducted by it and has conducted the Credit
Card Business and operated each of the Purchased Assets owned by it at all times
in  compliance  in all  material  respects  with  all  such  Authorizations.  No
Governmental  Authority  has placed any written  restriction  on the Credit Card
Business  or the  Purchased  Assets or Circuit  City,  FNANB,  or Tyler  Funding
specifically  with respect to the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
herein or in the Program  Agreement.  Circuit City, FNANB, and Tyler Funding are
not in default under,  and no event has occurred which with the lapse of time or
action  by a third  party  could  result in a  default  under,  the terms of any
judgment, order, writ, decree, permit or license of any Governmental Authority.

     SECTION  5.19.  Disclosure.  No statement or  description  contained in any
document  provided  or  delivered  by Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding to
Purchaser in connection with the series of transactions  contemplated hereby set
forth  in  Section  5.19  of  the  Seller  Disclosure  Schedule  (the  "Reviewed
Documents"),  as of the date of such  statement or  description,  contained  any
untrue  statement  of a material  fact,  or  omitted  to state a  material  fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading;  provided,  however, that (i) in the
case of an untrue statement of a material fact,  neither Circuit City nor either
Seller will be liable for any such untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement
made in a Reviewed  Document  to the extent  such  untrue  statement  or alleged
untrue statement was corrected in a document  subsequently provided or delivered
by Circuit City,  FNANB or Tyler Funding to Purchaser and (ii) in the case of an
omission  to state a material  fact  necessary  in order to make the  statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading,  neither  Circuit City nor either Seller will be liable for any such
omission or alleged omission to the extent such omission or alleged omission was
rectified in another  document  provided or delivered by Circuit City,  FNANB or
Tyler Funding to  Purchaser.  Circuit City or FNANB has informed  Purchaser,  in
writing,  of any and all  features,  reward  programs,  benefits,  enhancements,
promotional  rate  programs,   balance  transfer  programs,   introductory  rate
strategies, and usage or activation strategies utilized by Circuit City or FNANB
that remain in effect with respect to the Accounts,  or which continue to affect
any Account, as of the Cut-Off Time.

     SECTION 5.20. Insurance Contracts; Credit Protector Contracts.

     (a) Schedule  5.20 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth (i) each
insurance  agreement and arrangement  maintained by Sellers or their  Affiliates
with any insurance agent,

                                       44

insurance  company,  or  reinsurance  company  for the purpose of  providing  to
Borrowers credit life, health, accident, disability,  unemployment, or any other
credit related insurance  ("Insurance  Contract") and (ii) each agreement with a
Borrower  relating to the  cancellation of  indebtedness  upon the occurrence of
certain triggering events ("Credit Protector Contract").

     (b) As of the  Closing,  complete  and  current  copies  of each  Insurance
Contract and Credit Protector Contract have been provided to Purchaser.

     (c) Neither Seller is in default,  and no condition exists that with notice
or lapse of time or otherwise would  constitute a default with respect to either
Seller, under any Insurance Contract or Credit Protector Contract.

     (d) Sellers are not subject to any  Liabilities  arising from any Insurance
Contract or Credit Protector  Contract other than (i) commitments or obligations
arising under the terms and  provisions of such  agreement and (ii)  Liabilities
for which adequate  reserves have been reflected in Circuit City's  consolidated
financial statements.

     SECTION 5.21.  Card  Processor.  TSYS has been informed and is aware of the
assumption of its agreement with FNANB by Purchaser. TSYS has indicated to FNANB
that TSYS will cooperate and assist with the transition from FNANB to Purchaser.

     SECTION 5.22. Employee Benefit Plans; Employee Matters.

     (a) Section 5.22(a)-1 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule lists each Seller
Benefit Plan.  Section  5.22(a)-2 of the Seller  Disclosure  Schedule lists each
Employment Agreement for any Business Employee, and any collective bargaining or
similar agreements to which Circuit City or any of its Affiliates are party with
any labor  organization  or union  representing  any of the Business  Employees.
Notwithstanding  disclosure  on  Section  5.22(a)-2  of  the  Seller  Disclosure
Schedule, Purchaser shall not assume or be liable for any of Sellers' Employment
Agreements.

     (b)  With  respect  to each  Seller  Benefit  Plan,  FNANB  has  heretofore
delivered or made available to Purchaser true and complete  copies of the Seller
Benefit Plans and any amendments thereto,  and, with respect to the Circuit City
Savings  Plan,  a copy of the most  recent  annual  report on  Internal  Revenue
Service Form 5500, a copy of the most recent summary plan description (including
supplements)  required under ERISA with respect  thereto,  a copy of any related
trust or other funding  vehicle  documents and the latest  financial  statements
thereof,  the most recent reports or summaries required to be filed or disclosed
under ERISA or the Code and the most recent  determination  letter received from
the Internal Revenue Service.

     (c) Each of the Seller  Benefit  Plans (i) is in compliance in all material
respects  with the  applicable  provisions  of ERISA,  the  Code,  and all other
applicable  laws and  (ii)  has  been  administered,  operated  and  managed  in
accordance  with its  governing  documents.  Each Seller  Benefit  Plan which is
intended  to be  "qualified"  within  the  meaning  of Code  section  401(a) has
received a  favorable  determination  letter to such  effect  from the  Internal
Revenue  Service,  which has not been revoked,  and no event has occurred and no
condition  exists  that could  reasonably  be expected to cause or result in the
revocation of such  determination  letter.  None of Circuit City, FNANB or Tyler
Funding has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as

                                       45

defined  in  section  4975 of the Code or Section  406 of  ERISA),  which  could
subject any of the Seller Benefit Plans or their related  trusts,  Circuit City,
FNANB or Tyler  Funding,  any of their  subsidiaries  or any  person  that  such
entities have an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.  Any Seller Benefit Plan
previously  terminated by Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding,  or any ERISA
affiliate was terminated in accordance  with its terms and all  applicable  law,
including ERISA and the Code.

     (d) No liability  under Title IV of ERISA or under Section 302 of ERISA has
been incurred by Circuit City or any ERISA Affiliate  (including FNANB) that has
not been satisfied in full.

     (e) FNANB has delivered to Purchaser a true and complete copy of the master
Business  Employee  database  (or  one or more  similar  databases)  which  list
includes the following  information  (or equivalent  information) as of the most
recent  practicable date with respect to each Business  Employee (other than any
seasonal employee):  (i) date of hire and effective service date, (ii) job title
or position  held,  (iii) Fair Labor  Standards Act status,  (iv) base salary or
current wages and target bonus,  (v) to the extent  available,  scheduled salary
increase date and anticipated amount, (vi) to the extent available,  most recent
performance  ratings and/or other  performance  data, salary increase and bonus,
(vii)  employment  status (i.e.,  active or on leave,  short-term  disability or
long-term disability and full-time,  part-time or reduced schedule),  indicating
for any  employees on any leave the  anticipated  return to work date, if known,
and  (viii) for  Business  Employees  on or  requiring  employer-sponsored  work
authorization,  the type of  authorization  and  expiration  date.  FNANB  shall
provide an update to this information to Purchaser as soon as possible after the
date of this Agreement and shall provide a subsequent  update seven (7) business
days prior to the  Closing  Date.  References  in this  Agreement  to  "seasonal
employees"  shall mean  employees  hired by FNANB to address peak periods in its
business.

     (f) There are no  pending  or  threatened  claims  (other  than  claims for
benefits  in the  ordinary  course),  lawsuits or  arbitrations  which have been
asserted  or  instituted,   and,  to  the  Knowledge  of  Sellers,   no  set  of
circumstances  exists  which may  reasonably  give rise to a claim  (other  than
claims for  benefits  in the  ordinary  course) or  lawsuit,  against the Seller
Benefit  Plans,  any  fiduciaries  thereof  with  respect to their duties to the
Seller  Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Seller
Benefit  Plans which  could  reasonably  be  expected to result in any  material
liability  of Circuit  City to the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation,  the
Department of Treasury,  the Department of Labor, any  multi-employer  plan, any
Seller  Benefit Plan,  any  participant  in a Seller  Benefit Plan, or any other
person.

     (g) With respect to the Business Employees,  no labor organization or group
of employees of any Seller currently represents or has made a pending demand for
recognition or  certification,  and there are no representation or certification
proceedings or petitions seeking a representation  proceeding  presently pending
or threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other labor relations tribunal or authority.

                                       46

     SECTION 5.23. Taxes.

     (a) All Tax Returns  required to have been filed by or with  respect to the
Credit Card Business,  Tyler  Funding,  the Purchased  Assets,  or the Trust (or

Credit Card Business,  Tyler  Funding,  the Purchased  Assets,  or the Trust (or

Trust may have any  Liability;  (ii) no  Governmental  Authority has proposed in
writing  to  commence  an  audit,  suit,  proceeding,  investigation,  claim  or
administrative  proceeding  for or relating to any  liability  in respect of any
such Taxes and, to the Knowledge of Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding,  none
is pending  currently;  (iii) there are no  outstanding  written  agreements  or

the Trust under any tax-sharing or tax-allocation  agreement;  (v) the Trust has

oral advice or other  communication  with  respect to any matter  referenced  in
clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section 5.23(b).

     (c) It is  agreed  and  understood  by the  parties  that  except  for  the
representations   and   warranties   contained   in  this   Section   5.23,   no
representations  or warranties are made by Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding or
their respective Affiliates, including any member of the Circuit City Affiliated
Group or the Circuit City Group, relating to Taxes.

     (d) Nothing in this Section 5.23 shall cause  Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler
Funding,  or any  successors  in interest  thereto,  including any member of the
Circuit City  Affiliated  Group or the Circuit City Group,  to be liable for any
Taxes for which Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding or any successors-in-interest
thereto are not expressly liable pursuant to Article VIII.

     SECTION 5.24.  Insurance.  Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler Funding  maintain
insurance  policies and fidelity bonds (including  financial  institutions bond,
property and casualty insurance and workers' compensation  insurance) related to
the  Credit  Card  Business  of the type and in amounts  customarily  carried by
persons conducting similar  businesses;  provided,  however,  that Tyler Funding
does not maintain professional liability errors and omissions insurance. None of
such Parties has any  Knowledge  of any  threatened  termination  of or material
alteration of coverage under any of such policies or bonds.

     SECTION 5.25.  Finders or Brokers.  None of FNANB or any of its  Affiliates
has agreed to pay any fee or commission to any agent,  broker,  finder, or other
Person  for or on  account  of  services  rendered  as a  broker  or  finder  in
connection with this Agreement or the

                                       47

transactions contemplated hereby that would give rise to any valid claim against
Purchaser for any brokerage commission or finder's fee or like payment.

     SECTION  5.26.  Leased Real  Property.  (a) Schedule  1.01-3 sets forth the
address or other  description  of each  parcel of Leased  Real  Property.  True,
correct and  complete  copies of Sellers'  real estate files for the Leased Real
Property have been provided. There are no Contracts for the Leased Real Property

any of the  Improvements  which would  interfere  in any respect with the use or
occupancy of the  Improvements  or any portion  thereof in the  operation of the
Credit Card Business, as currently conducted.

     SECTION 5.27. Substantially All Assets. The sale of the Purchased Assets to
Purchaser  constitutes  a  transfer  of  each  Seller's  properties  and  assets

relating to the  Purchased  Assets,  including  the Leased Real  Property,  that
allege  the  violation  of  or  seek  to  impose   Liability   pursuant  to  any
Environmental Law and, there are no investigations  pending or, to the Knowledge
of Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding, threatened against Circuit City, FNANB
or Tyler Funding with respect to the Purchased Assets, including the Leased Real
Property,  which in any case could give rise to Environmental  Losses;  (iii) to
the  Knowledge of Circuit  City,  FNANB and Tyler  Funding,  there are no facts,
circumstances  or conditions  relating to, arising from or  attributable  to the
Purchased Assets, including the Leased Real Property, that are reasonably likely
to give rise to  Environmental  Losses;  and (iv) Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler
Funding  have  provided  Purchaser  with copies of all  environmentally  related
audits,  assessments,  studies,  reports, analyses and results of investigations
related to the Purchased Assets, including any Leased Real Property, that are in
the  possession,  custody or control of Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler  Funding.
There are no  pending,  or to the  Knowledge  of Circuit  City,  FNANB and Tyler
Funding threatened, investigations, actions, proceedings or claims of whatsoever
nature arising

                                       48

under any Environmental Law involving the Purchased Assets, including the Leased
Real Property.

     SECTION 5.29.  Financial  Ability to Perform.  Each of Circuit City, FNANB,
and Tyler Funding is fully capable from a financial standpoint of performing its

     SECTION  5.31.  No Other  Representations  or  Warranties.  Except  for the
representations  and  warranties  contained  in this  Agreement  (including  the

nor any agent, Affiliate,  officer, director,  employee or representative of any

forth herein and Purchaser  will not have any right or remedy arising out of any
other representation, warranty, or statement.

Agreement has been, and as of the Closing Date the Related  Agreements  will be,
duly  and  validly  executed  and  delivered  by  Purchaser.  Assuming  the  due

upon  reasonable  advance notice for purposes  reasonably  consistent  with this
Agreement, to their respective properties, premises,

                                       53

facilities,  employees and representatives and books and records,  including all
computer  tapes and  similarly  stored  data,  but only to the extent  that such

Tyler Funding or their  respective  Affiliates and only to the extent related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Related Agreements and
(ii) each of Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding shall direct their respective
employees,  agents and representatives and shall cause the employees, agents and
representatives  of their Affiliates,  to cooperate fully with Purchaser and its
representatives; provided, however that, in each case, Purchaser, its Affiliates
and their  respective  representatives  shall  comply  with the  confidentiality

waiver of any attorney-client privilege.

     (b) To the  fullest  extent  not  prohibited  by  Requirements  of Law,  in
furtherance  of the terms of Section  7.03(a)  and subject to the  provisos  set
forth therein,  from the date hereof to the Closing Date, (i) senior officers of
the Credit Card Business and of the credit card business of Purchaser shall meet
on a regular basis (no less than bi-weekly) to review the financial  performance
and  operational  affairs  of the  Credit  Card  Business  to achieve an orderly
integration of the Credit Card Business by Purchaser as of the Closing, and (ii)
no later than ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof, Sellers and Purchaser
shall each appoint three  officers with  knowledge of, and  experience,  in, the
credit card business to comprise a transition team (the "Transition Team") which
shall  meet on a  regular  basis  to  discuss  and  implement  reasonable  steps
necessary  to achieve an orderly  integration  of the Credit  Card  Business  by
Purchaser as of the Closing and to attempt to minimize  Purchaser's  reliance on
interim services from Sellers  following the Closing.  The Transition Team shall
negotiate in good faith the terms of the  Transition  Services  Agreement  which
shall  incorporate  the terms and provisions set forth on Exhibit G, pursuant to
which Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall provide to Purchaser and its
Affiliates  all interim  services as are  necessary,  including the provision of

Agreement shall govern the access rights of the Parties hereto.

     SECTION 7.04. Confidentiality.

     (a) All information furnished by a Party (the "Protected Party") to another
Party  (the  "Receiving  Party")  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  shall be  received  in  confidence  and kept
confidential  by such other  Party,  and shall be used by it only in  connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,

                                       54

except to the extent that such  information:  (i) is already  lawfully  known to
such other party when received; (ii) thereafter becomes lawfully obtainable from
other sources other than as a result of disclosure by such other Party; (iii) is
required to be disclosed to VISA or to a Governmental Authority having authority
over such Party;  (iv) is disclosed to its auditors or counsel (each of whom the
disclosing Party shall cause to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such
information  confidential  and to use the  same  only in  connection  with  this
Agreement)  or is required to be  disclosed  strictly on a need to know basis to
its  lenders,  investors,  or  rating  agencies;  or (v)  is  required  by  law,
regulation  or court  order  to be  disclosed  by such  other  party;  provided,
however;  that prior notice of such  disclosure  (other than to its  Affiliates,
auditors,  counsel,  rating agencies or lenders) has been given to the Protected
Party,  when legally  permissible,  and that the Party which is required to make
the disclosure uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide sufficient notice
to permit the Protected Party to take legal action to prevent the disclosure. In
protecting such information  from  disclosure,  the Receiving Party shall use at
least  the  same  level  of care  that it uses to  protect  its own  proprietary
information,  but in no event shall the Receiving Party use less than reasonable
care in taking security measures to protect the information. If the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  shall fail to be consummated,  such other Party,
at the request of the Protected  Party,  shall as soon as practicable  cause all
originals and copies of documents or extracts thereof containing all information
and data furnished by the Protected  Party to be returned to the Protected Party
or destroyed  and shall cause an officer to so certify to the  Protected  Party.
Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   each  Party  may  retain  one  copy  of  the
confidential  information  subject to the terms hereof with its general  counsel
solely for the purpose of dealing with claims  arising  under this Section 7.04.
This Section 7.04 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Following the
Closing,  if there is any conflict between the terms of this Section 7.04(a) and
the terms of the Program  Agreement,  the terms of the Program  Agreement  shall
govern.

     (b) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,  except as reasonably
necessary  to comply  with  applicable  securities  laws,  each  Party (and each
employee, representative, or other agent of such Party) is permitted to disclose
the Tax Treatment and Tax Structure (as such terms are  hereinafter  defined) of
the transaction  contemplated by this Agreement  (including all materials of any
kind,  including  opinions and other tax analyses,  to the extent such materials
relate solely to such Tax Treatment and Tax Structure);  provided, however, that
such  disclosure may not be made until the earlier of (i) the date of the public
announcement of discussions  relating to this transaction;  (ii) the date of the
public  announcement of this transaction;  or (iii) the date of the execution of
this Agreement to enter into this transaction. In addition, each Party's ability
to consult any tax advisor  (including a tax advisor  independent from all other
entities  involved  in the  transaction)  regarding  the  Tax  Treatment  or Tax
Structure of the transaction  contemplated hereby is not limited in any way. For
purposes of this provision, "Tax Treatment" means the purported or claimed state
or  Federal  income  tax  treatment  of the  transaction  contemplated  by  this
Agreement  and  "Tax  Structure"   means  any  fact  that  may  be  relevant  to
understanding the Tax Treatment. For this purpose,  disclosure is limited to any
statements  or  information  relating  to the U.S.  state or federal  income tax
treatment  or tax  structure of the  transaction  and does not include any other
information  furnished  by any Party to another  Party in  connection  with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

     SECTION 7.05. Books and Records.  Each Party hereto shall preserve and keep
all books and records and all information relating to the accounting,  business,
and financial  affairs that are retained by FNANB or its  Affiliates or obtained
by Purchaser or its Affiliates hereunder,  as the case may be, which information
relates to the  Purchased  Assets,  the Assumed  Liabilities  or the Credit Card
Business,  for a reasonable  period  (three (3) years or such longer  period set
forth in Exhibit R) after the Closing  Date, or for any longer period (i) as may
be  required  by any  Governmental  Authority  and  (ii)  as  may be  reasonably
necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any audit or other legal
action  that is then  pending  or  threatened  and with  respect  to  which  the
requesting  Party has notified  the other  Parties as to the need to retain such
books,  records  or  information.  Each  Party  shall  allow the  other  Parties
reasonable access to such Books and Records and the right to make copies thereof
at reasonable  times upon reasonable  notice and shall provide,  upon reasonable
notice, copies thereof if such Books and Records are required in connection with
any claim or proceeding in which such Party is involved, provided, however, that
this  Section  7.05 shall not require any Party to provide such access or copies
to another Party with respect to any claims or  proceedings of one Party against
another  Party.  Commencing on the Closing Date,  the Books and Records shall be
the property of Purchaser;  provided that Circuit City, FNANB,  Tyler Funding or
their Affiliates may retain possession of such copies thereof as may be required
to meet legal,  regulatory,  tax, accounting and auditing  requirements and with
respect to the prosecution or defense of any audit or other legal action and may
use such copies solely for those purposes. Except for any Books and Records that
Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding or their Affiliates cannot reasonably segment
from books and records  relating to the credit card  accounts  not being sold to
Purchaser  hereunder,  Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding and their Affiliates
will make the Books and  Records  available  for  delivery to  Purchaser  on the
Closing Date. If the Books and Records delivered by Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler
Funding or their  Affiliates  contain  information on accounts not being sold to
Purchaser hereunder,  Purchaser shall comply with the confidentiality provisions
contained  herein  with  respect  to such  information  and  shall  not use such
information for any purpose.

     SECTION 7.06. Publicity;  Press Releases.  Except as may be required by any
Requirement of Law, neither Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding,  Purchaser nor
any of their respective Affiliates, subsequent to the date hereof and continuing
after  the  Closing  Date,  shall  issue a press  release  or  make  any  public
announcement or statement related to the transactions  contemplated hereby, this
Agreement,  or the financial terms hereof without the prior consent of the other
Parties  hereto,  which consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed.
Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding,  and Purchaser agree, to the extent possible
and legally permissible,  to notify and consult with such other Parties at least
48 hours in advance of filing any notice  required  by any  Requirement  of Law.
This Section 7.06 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

     SECTION  7.07.   Delivery  of  Required   Securitization   Amendments   and
Securitization  Transfer  Agreements;  Exchange Act Registration.  Circuit City,
FNANB and Tyler Funding shall cause the Required  Securitization  Amendments and
the Securitization  Transfer Agreements to be executed by the parties thereto on
or before the Closing Date.  Purchaser shall  reasonably  cooperate with Circuit
City, FNANB and Tyler Funding in connection therewith.  FNANB, Tyler Funding and
Purchaser  shall cause the Trust to file any and all SEC  documents  relating to
the Required Securitization Amendments and the

                                       56

Securitization  Transfer  Agreements  within  the  appropriate  time  after  the
effectiveness  thereof.  The costs associated with the preparation and filing of
such SEC  documents  shall be borne by the Party that is  required  to make such
filing.  Purchaser  shall be primarily  responsible for any and all such filings
(and any related  certifications to the SEC) after Closing;  provided,  however,
that FNANB shall  provide to Purchaser on the Closing Date (i) a  certification,
substantially in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto,  with respect to periods
commencing after February 29, 2004 and ending prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
a certification,  substantially  in the form of Exhibit Q attached hereto,  with
respect to the period from and  including  the first day of the Closing Month to
but excluding  the Closing  Date.  Sellers shall cause the Class A Floating Rate
Asset Backed  Certificates,  Series 2003-2,  to be registered under the Exchange
Act on or before the Closing Date.

     SECTION 7.08. Advice of Changes.  From the date hereof to the Closing Date,
Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler Funding,  on the one hand, and Purchaser,  on the
other hand, shall promptly advise the other in writing upon acquiring  Knowledge
of any fact  which,  if existing  or known at the date  hereof,  would have been
required to be set forth or disclosed  pursuant to this Agreement or of any fact
which,  if  existing  or known at the date  hereof,  would  have made any of the
representations  of such Party contained herein untrue in any material  respect.
No such information  shall impact any  representation or warranty made as of the
date hereof of the Party  disclosing such  information or any rights or remedies
available to the Party receiving such  information in connection with any breach
of any  representation  or warranty;  provided,  however,  that a breach of this
Section  7.08  shall  not  be  considered  for  purposes  of   determining   the
satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Article IX or give rise to a
right of termination  under Article XI if the underlying breach or breaches with
respect to which a Party  failed to give notice  would not result in the failure
of the  closing  conditions  set forth in  Article IX or would not result in the
ability of any non-breaching Party to terminate this Agreement under Article XI,
as the case may be.

     SECTION 7.09. Efforts; Filings.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  each of Circuit
City, FNANB, Tyler Funding,  and Purchaser shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts
to take,  agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do, or
cause to be done,  any and all  things  necessary,  proper  or  advisable  under
Requirements  of Law or  otherwise,  so as to, as promptly as  practicable:  (i)
permit  consummation of the purchase of the Purchased  Assets and the assumption
of the  Assumed  Liabilities  and  (ii)  otherwise  enable  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  the Related  Agreements and the
Securitization  Transfer  Agreements,  and  each  shall,  and  shall  cause  its
respective  Affiliates to,  cooperate fully to that end. As used in this Section
7.09,  "Reasonable Best Efforts" shall be deemed to include promptly agreeing to
take,  taking,  or  causing  to be taken  any and all  actions  required  by any
Governmental  Authority,  including  the  U.S.  Federal  Trade  Commission,  the
Antitrust  Division of the U.S.  Department  of Justice,  or any state  attorney
general, or any state insurance regulator, to the extent necessary to consummate
the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  as promptly  as  reasonably
practicable, so long as such actions are expressly conditioned on the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  provided, that such actions do
not result and would not  reasonably be likely to result in (i) an  Unreasonable
Condition or (ii) a divestiture,  change in business  practice,  modification of
business model, or

                                       57

entry into a consent  decree or similar  accord  with a  Governmental  Authority
which the applicable Party shall determine, in its sole discretion, not to be in
its best interests.

     (b) As promptly as  practicable  but in no event  later than  fifteen  (15)
Business Days after the date of this  Agreement,  if and to the extent  required
under the HSR Act or the Bank Merger Act,  Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding,
and Purchaser  shall prepare and file all documents and  notifications  with the
Federal  Trade  Commission  and the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice,  or with the
applicable banking Governmental Authorities,  as are required to comply with the
HSR Act or the Bank  Merger  Act,  and the  rules  and  regulations  promulgated
thereunder.  Purchaser,  with the good faith  cooperation of Circuit City, FNANB
and Tyler Funding,  shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to take or cause to be
taken as promptly as practicable all such additional actions as may be necessary
to obtain  such prior  approval.  Each Party  shall file with the OCC any report
that is  required  to be filed by it with the OCC  periodically,  including  any
report  that is required  to be filed  pursuant to 12 U.S.C.  ss. 161, as of the
date hereof.  The Parties shall  cooperate  with each other in good faith in the
preparation and coordination of all such filings and responses, and shall do, or
cause to be done,  all  things  and  take,  or cause to be  taken,  all  actions
required to obtain the prompt termination of any waiting period thereunder.

     (c) Without  limiting the  foregoing,  each of Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler
Funding,  and Purchaser  agrees to use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to
prepare all  documentation,  to effect all  filings  and to obtain all  permits,
consents,   clearances,   approvals  and   authorizations  of  all  Governmental
Authorities and other Persons  (including,  if applicable,  the Card Association
and  TSYS)  necessary  to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
Agreement,  the Related  Agreements and  Securitization  Transfer  Agreements as
promptly  as  practicable.  In  connection  with  effecting  any such  filing or
obtaining  any  such  permit,  consent,  clearance,  approval  or  authorization
necessary to consummate the  transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement,  the
Related Agreements and Securitization Transfer Agreements,  each of such Parties
shall,  subject to applicable  law, (i) permit  counsel for the other Parties to
review in  advance,  and  consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection  with,  any  proposed  written   communication  to  any  Governmental
Authority,  and (ii)  provide  counsel for the other  Parties with copies of all
filings made by such Party, and all  correspondence  between such Party (and its
advisors) with any Governmental  Authority and any other information supplied by
such Party and such Party's  Affiliates to a Governmental  Authority or received
from such a Governmental  Authority;  provided,  however,  that materials may be
redacted or withheld (x) to the extent they concern the  valuation of the Credit
Card Business or alternatives to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) as necessary to comply with  contractual  arrangements.  Each of Circuit
City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding,  and Purchaser  agrees not to  participate,  or to
permit its respective  Affiliates to participate,  in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby unless
it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent not  prohibited
by such  Governmental  Authority,  gives the other  Parties the  opportunity  to
attend and participate.

     (d) Circuit City, FNANB, and Tyler Funding, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand,  shall each pay half of the filing fee relating to any filing
required under the HSR Act.

                                       58

     SECTION 7.10. No Solicitation.  Neither Circuit City, FNANB,  Tyler Funding
nor  any  of  their  respective   Affiliates  shall,  or  permit  any  of  their
Subsidiaries  to, or  authorize or permit any  director,  officer or employee of
such Parties or any of their respective  Subsidiaries or any investment  banker,
attorney,  accountant or other advisor or  representative of the such Parties or
any of their  respective  Subsidiaries  to,  directly  or  indirectly,  solicit,
initiate or  encourage,  take any other action  knowingly to  facilitate,  enter
into,  continue or  otherwise  participate  in any  negotiations  regarding,  or
furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way with,  any  inquiry,  proposal or offer from any Person  relating to, or
that is reasonably likely to lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition, in one
transaction or a series of  transactions,  including any merger,  consolidation,
exchange offer, binding share exchange, business combination,  recapitalization,
liquidation,  dissolution,  joint venture or similar transaction,  of any assets
(other  than (i) as  permitted  under  Section  7.01 or (ii) to the extent  such
assets would not reasonably be expected to be included in the Purchased Assets),
stock (or other equity or voting  interests)  or  businesses  of the Credit Card
Business.

     SECTION 7.11. Miscellaneous  Agreements and Consents.  Subject to the terms
and conditions  contained herein,  each Party shall use commercially  reasonable
efforts to take,  or cause to be taken,  all  action,  and to do, or cause to be
done,  all  things  necessary,  appropriate  or  desirable  hereunder  and under
applicable   laws  and   regulations   to  consummate  and  make  effective  the
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement and the Related  Agreements.  Each
Party will use commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain consents of all third
parties and any  Governmental  Authority  necessary for the  consummation of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  The Parties and their  respective
officers,  directors and/or employees shall use commercially  reasonable efforts
to take such further  actions  subsequent to the Closing Date as are  reasonably
necessary, appropriate or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.12. Assignment of Contracts; Approvals and Consents.

     (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  in this  Agreement  to the  contrary,  this
Agreement  shall not  constitute an agreement to assign any Assumed  Contract or
Intellectual Property Right or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a
third party thereto,  would constitute a breach or other contravention  thereof,
be ineffective  with respect to any party thereto or in any way adversely affect
the rights of any of Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding or their  respective
Affiliates, as applicable, or Purchaser thereunder.

     (b) With respect to any Assumed  Contract  and any claim,  right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, FNANB, Circuit City and Tyler Funding
will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as expeditiously as possible,
to the extent required under such Assumed  Contract,  the written consent of the
other  parties to such  Assumed  Contract  for the  assignment  or, if required,
novation thereof to Purchaser or amendment.  In furtherance of the foregoing, as
soon as  practicable  following the date hereof,  Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler
Funding shall submit to the other party or parties to any such Assumed  Contract
documentation  seeking the written approval of such other  contracting  party or
parties thereto to the transfer, assignment, novation or amendment of all of the
applicable  Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding claims,  rights,  benefits and
liabilities  thereunder to Purchaser.  In no event, however, shall Circuit City,
FNANB, Tyler Funding, or Purchaser be obligated to

                                       59

pay any  money to any  Person  or to offer or  grant  other  financial  or other
accommodations   to  any  Person  in  connection  with  obtaining  any  consent,
confirmation,  novation,  amendment  or  approval  with  respect to any  Assumed
Contract that would be reasonably  likely to result in loss of benefits or costs
to  Purchaser,  on the one  hand,  or  Sellers,  on the  other  hand,  that  are
significant in amount.

     (c) If any consent, confirmation, novation or approval is not obtained with
respect to any  Assumed  Contract,  Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding,  and
Purchaser   will  cooperate  to  establish  an  agency  type  or  other  similar
arrangement  reasonably  satisfactory to Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding, and
Purchaser under which Purchaser would obtain, to the fullest extent  practicable
and not prohibited by any applicable  Requirements  of Law or any Contract,  the
claims,  rights  and  benefits  and  assume the  corresponding  liabilities  and
obligations  thereunder in accordance with this Agreement (including by means of
any  subcontracting,  sublicensing  or  subleasing  arrangement)  or under which
Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding  or  their  respective   Affiliates,   as
applicable,  would enforce at the direction of and for the benefit of Purchaser,
with  Purchaser  assuming  and  agreeing  to pay such  Party's  obligations  and
expenses,  any and all claims, rights and benefits of such Party against a third
party thereto.  In such event (i) such Party, as applicable,  will promptly pay,
assign and remit to Purchaser  when received all monies and other  consideration
relating to the period after the Closing Date  received by it under any Contract
or any claim,  right or benefit arising  thereunder not transferred  pursuant to
this Section 7.12 and (ii)  Purchaser  will promptly  pay,  perform or discharge
when due any  obligation  or liability  (including  any Tax  Liability)  arising
thereunder after the Closing Date.

     SECTION 7.13. Notice of Proceedings. Purchaser will promptly notify Circuit
City,  FNANB and Tyler  Funding in writing,  and Circuit  City,  FNANB and Tyler
Funding will promptly  notify  Purchaser in writing,  upon (a) becoming aware of
any order or decree or any complaint praying for an order or decree  restraining
or  enjoining  the  execution  of  this  Agreement  or the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  hereunder,  or (b)  receiving  any  notice  from any
Governmental Authority of its intention (i) to institute a suit or proceeding to
restrain or enjoin the execution of this  Agreement or the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby, or (ii) to nullify or render ineffective this
Agreement or such transactions if consummated.

     SECTION 7.14. Guaranties; Intercompany Agreements.

     (a) To the extent that Circuit City, FNANB or Tyler Funding would otherwise
retain liability thereunder with respect to any post-Closing  period,  Purchaser
shall cause itself or one or more of its  Affiliates  to be  substituted  in all
respects  for any such Party,  effective  as of the  Closing,  in respect of all
obligations  of  each  such  Party  under  each  of  the   guaranties,   bonding
arrangements,  letters of credit and letters of comfort  identified  in Schedule
7.14(a) (the "Guaranties"), each of which was obtained by any such Party for the
benefit of the Credit Card  Business.  If  Purchaser  is unable to effect such a
substitution  with respect to any Guaranty after using  commercially  reasonable
efforts to do so,  Purchaser shall hold Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding and
their respective  Affiliates harmless with respect to the obligations covered by
each of the Guaranties for which Purchaser does not effect such substitution. As
a result, neither Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall from

                                       60

and  after  the  Closing  have  any  obligation  whatsoever  arising  from or in
connection  with the Guaranties  with respect to matters arising on or after the
Closing  Date  except  for  obligations,  if any,  for which  such Party will be
indemnified by Purchaser as set forth in Article X hereof.

     (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.14(b) or as otherwise contemplated by
this  Agreement,  FNANB shall,  and shall cause its  respective  Affiliates  to,
immediately prior to the Closing, execute and deliver such releases, termination
agreements  and  discharges as are necessary to (i) release and discharge  FNANB
and its Affiliates  (other than the Trust) from any and all obligations owed (x)
to the Trust or (y) in connection with the Credit Card Business, to Circuit City
and any of its Affiliates, (ii) release and discharge the Trust from any and all
obligations  owed to Circuit City,  FNANB, or any Affiliate  thereof (other than
the Trust) and (iii)  terminate  all  arrangements,  commitments,  contracts and
understandings among Circuit City, FNANB, and any Affiliate thereof which would,
absent such termination, constitute a Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability.

     SECTION 7.15. Bulk Sales Law. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Circuit
City and Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates,  in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  with the provisions of any applicable  bulk
sales law (including any applicable bulk transfer provisions).  Circuit City and
Sellers will, jointly and severally,  indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from
any and all Damages  (including  all damages  from claims made by  creditors  of
Sellers)  relating  to  provisions  of the bulk sales laws of any state or other
jurisdiction which may be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby and
from all costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred in the defense of
any claims made under such laws. All rights and  obligations  under this Section
7.15 shall survive the Closing Date and continue until sixty (60) days after the
expiration  of all  applicable  statutes  of  limitation  (including  extensions
thereof).

     SECTION 7.16. VISA Agreement.  From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Circuit City,  FNANB and Tyler Funding shall,  and shall cause their  respective
Affiliates  to,  operate and  conduct the Credit Card  Business in a manner that
continues to observe the terms of the VISA Agreement to the same extent that the
operation  and  conduct  of the Credit  Card  Business  by Circuit  City and its
Affiliates  would have been subject to the terms of the VISA  Agreement  had the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and the Related  Agreements  not
occurred.  Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding and Purchaser shall cooperate in
good  faith to  terminate  (including  providing  releases  and other  customary
documents upon such  termination) or amend any terms of the VISA  Agreement,  as
reasonably directed by Purchaser.

     SECTION  7.17.  Notice to Borrowers.  Promptly  following the Closing Date,
FNANB  and  Purchaser  shall  prepare  jointly a form or forms of notice to each
Borrower  to the  effect  that such  Borrower's  Account  has been  acquired  by
Purchaser.  Such notice  shall be in the form  approved by both  Parties,  which
approval will not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed, and will comply with all
applicable  Requirements  of Law. The costs of  preparation  and mailing of such
notices shall be borne by Purchaser. The mailing shall be made prior to the 60th
day after the Closing  Date in such manner as FNANB and  Purchaser  may mutually
agree.  Purchaser  shall bear the expenses of such notices,  including  costs of
mailing; provided, however, that no costs shall be assessed against Purchaser in
the event  any such  notices  are  provided  in the form of a billing  statement
message. FNANB and Purchaser shall include such other billing statement

                                       61

messages in the  mailings  described  above as shall be mutually  agreed upon by
FNANB and Purchaser.

     SECTION 7.18. Employee Matters.

     (a)  Employment  of  Continuing  Business  Employees.  Effective  as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall offer employment,  subject to Purchasers' standard
pre-employment drug screenings and criminal background check, to:

         (i) those Business  Employees employed at the FNANB facility located in
     Kennesaw,  Georgia, other than the senior management-level employees listed
     on Schedule 7.18 (the "Kennesaw Senior Management Employees");

         (ii)  those  Business  Employees  employed  at the  FNANB  facility  in
     Richmond,   Virginia  in   information   systems  (other  than  the  senior
     management-level    employee(s)    listed    on    Schedule    7.18)    and
     accounting/settlements; and

         (iii) those  Kennesaw  Senior  Management  Employees and other Business
     Employees  employed at the FNANB  facility in  Richmond,  Virginia  ("Other
     Richmond  Employees"),  and identified by the  Transition  Team pursuant to
     Section 7.18(f),

for active  employment  commencing  immediately upon the Closing for the same or
similar  number of hours per week employed by Circuit City or FNANB  immediately
prior to the Closing,  with base pay at least equal to such Business  Employee's
base rate of pay as in effect  immediately  prior to the Closing Date,  and with
incentive  pay and employee  benefits  that are at least equal to the  incentive
opportunities  and employee  benefits that are  available to similarly  situated
employees of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.  In addition,  Kennesaw  Business
Employees shall be offered employment by Purchaser within 30 miles of the Leased
Real  Property.  Each  Business  Employee who accepts  such offer of  employment
(including  Business  Employees  described  in  clause  (ii)  of the  definition
thereof)  with  Purchaser  is  referred  to  herein  as a  "Continuing  Business
Employee."  Such  employment  by Purchaser  shall  commence  effective as of the
Closing  Date  (except as  otherwise  provided in the  definition  of  "Business
Employee"). Purchaser shall have no liability with respect to Business Employees
who do not become Continuing Business Employees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Continuing  Business  Employees  shall  be  considered  "at-will"  employees  of
Purchaser,  and Purchaser shall have no obligation to retain Continuing Business
Employees for any specific  period of time  following  the Closing Date,  unless
otherwise  required  by law.  For  purposes  of this  Section  7.18,  Continuing
Business  Employees  employed at FNANB's  Kennesaw,  Georgia facility are called
"Kennesaw  Continuing  Business  Employees," and Continuing  Business  Employees
employed at FNANB's Richmond,  Virginia facility are called "Richmond Continuing
Business Employees."

     (b) Preexisting Conditions;  Deductibles; Credited Service. Effective as of
the  Closing,  Purchaser  shall  (i) cause to be waived  all  limitations  as to
preexisting   conditions,   exclusions  and  waiting  periods  with  respect  to
participation  and  coverage  requirements  applicable  to  Continuing  Business
Employees under any welfare plan of Purchaser or its  Subsidiaries or Affiliates
in which such Continuing Business Employees may be eligible to participate after

                                       62

the Closing, to the extent that such conditions,  exclusions and waiting periods
would have been waived or  satisfied  under the  corresponding  welfare  plan in
which any such Continuing  Business Employee  participated  immediately prior to
the  Closing,  (ii) cause to be provided to each  Continuing  Business  Employee
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing, in respect
of the  calendar  year in which the  Closing  Date  occurs,  in  satisfying  any
applicable  deductible or out-of-pocket  requirements under any welfare plans of
Purchaser or its  Subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such  Continuing  Business
Employees may be eligible to  participate  after the Closing,  (iii) cause to be
provided to each Continuing Business Employee credit for purposes of eligibility
and  vesting  for all  service  recognized  by Sellers  under the  corresponding
Circuit  City  Benefit  Plan,  under  each  employee  benefit  plan,  program or
arrangement  of  Purchaser  or its  Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  in which  such
Continuing  Business Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing and
(iv) cause to be provided to each Continuing Business Employee credit for amount
of benefits for all service  with Sellers for purposes of the vacation  policies
and  severance  plans or policies  maintained  or provided by  Purchaser  or its
Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  in which such  Continuing  Business  Employees are
eligible  to  participate  after the  Closing.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Continuing  Business  Employees'  service  with  Circuit  City,  FNANB and Tyler
Funding  shall not be  recognized  for  purposes of benefit  accruals  under any
defined pension benefit plan sponsored by Purchaser.

     (c)  COBRA.  Circuit  City shall  retain  responsibility  for  continuation
coverage under Sections 601 et seq. of ERISA and any state continuation coverage
requirements  ("COBRA   Obligations")  to  all  Business  Employees  (and  their
qualified  beneficiaries) for whom a "qualifying event" under COBRA occurs on or
prior to Closing.  Purchaser  shall be responsible  for COBRA  Obligations  with
respect to the Continuing  Business Employees and their beneficiaries for whom a
"qualifying event" under COBRA occurs after the Closing.

     (d) Retirement  Plans.  As soon as practicable  following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall permit Continuing Business Employees to rollover, in cash, their
account balances in the Circuit City Savings Plan into  Purchaser's  Savings and
Investment Plan (the "Purchaser's Savings Plan") to the extent the Administrator
of Purchaser's SIP determines such rollover to be qualified.

     (e) WARN Act.  The Parties  agree to  cooperate  in good faith to determine
whether  any  notification  may be required  under the WARN Act as a result,  in
whole or in part, of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  Sellers
will be responsible  for providing any  notification  that may be required under
the WARN Act with respect to any Business Employee.

     (f) Selection of Business  Employees for Employment  Offers. The Transition
Team  shall  identify  which  Kennesaw  Senior  Management  Employees  and Other
Richmond  Employees  shall be offered  employment by Purchaser;  provided,  that
while the representatives of Purchaser shall consult with the representatives of
the Sellers on all hiring decisions, the decision with respect to whether or not
to extend offers shall be made by Purchaser. The Transition Team shall develop a
process  for making  hiring  decisions  as  promptly  as  practicable  after the
execution of this  Agreement and  Purchaser  shall use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to complete all hiring decisions and extend offers to Business Employees
within sixty (60) days after the execution of this Agreement.

                                       63

     (g)  Cooperation.  Circuit City,  Sellers and Purchaser  shall cooperate in
good  faith,  and  Circuit  City,  Sellers and  Purchaser  and their  respective
Affiliates shall provide access to such  information as is reasonably  necessary
or appropriate,  to facilitate  implementation of the provisions of this Section
7.18.  Circuit City, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith, in the
preparation of  communications to Business  Employees  regarding the Purchaser's
offers of employment  contemplated  by Section 7.18(a) and the transition of the
Credit Card Business to Purchaser.

     (h)  Non-Solicitation.  Circuit City, FNANB and Tyler Funding shall not, on
behalf of themselves or any other person, for a period of two (2) years from the
date of this Agreement, directly or indirectly,

         (i) induce to terminate employment or solicit for employment,  hire, or
     employ at Circuit City's corporate  headquarters in Richmond,  Virginia, or
     at any Circuit City store  located in the Richmond,  Virginia  metropolitan
     area, any Richmond Continuing Business Employee; or

         (ii)  induce to  terminate  employment  or solicit  for  employment  at
     Circuit City's  corporate  headquarters  in Richmond,  Virginia,  or at any
     Circuit City store located in the Atlanta,  Georgia  metropolitan area, any
     Kennesaw Continuing Business Employee or any other employee of Purchaser of
     whom  Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding  became  aware as a result of
     negotiating  or  implementing  this  Agreement,  or any  such  employee  of
     Purchaser who left Purchaser  voluntarily  within the three months prior to
     the date of this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  this Agreement shall not
     prohibit  Circuit  City,  FNANB  and Tyler  Funding  from  hiring  any such
     employee of  Purchaser  who become  known to those  entities  because  such
     employees  responded  to a public  announcement  or  general  advertisement
     placed by Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding,  which  announcement  or
     advertisement is made to the public at large.

Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  in this  Section  7.18(h),  none of
Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding  shall be  prohibited  from  soliciting,
hiring, or employing any Continuing Business Employee,  or any other employee of
Purchaser, who is terminated by Purchaser, with or without cause.

     (i)  Liability.  Purchaser  shall assume no  liability  with respect to any
claims or causes of actions  by or on behalf of  Continuing  Business  Employees
with respect to any actions, omissions or events occurring prior to Closing (or,
for  employees  falling  under  clause  (ii)  of  the  definition  of  "Business
Employees",  the date they  become  Continuing  Business  Employees  on or after
Closing).  Purchaser shall assume no liability regarding employees,  officers or
directors other than that expressly assumed in this Agreement.

     (j) No Assumption of or Liability for Seller Benefit Plans.  Purchaser will
not assume  sponsorship of or liability under any Seller Benefit Plans.  Sellers
or Circuit  City shall  retain  all assets of all Seller  Benefit  Plans and all
liabilities for any benefits or payments due to employees of Circuit City, FNANB
and Tyler Funding thereunder.

                                       64

     (k) Amendment of Certain Retention Agreements. Within sixty (60) days after
the date of this  Agreement,  the Transition  Team shall identify and provide to
FNANB  a list of  those  Business  Employees  that  the  Transition  Team  deems
necessary for an efficient and successful transition of the Credit Card Business
to Purchaser (the  "Transition  Business  Employees").  Promptly upon receipt of
such list from the  Transition  Team,  FNANB shall use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to amend,  effective  as of the Closing  Date,  the  existing  retention
agreements (the "Original Retention  Agreements" and the retention agreements as
so amended,  the "Amended  Retention  Agreements") with the Transition  Business
Employees to provide that each Transition Business Employee who accepts an offer
of employment with Purchaser on the terms  contemplated by this Section 7.18 and
is either (i)  continuously  employed by Purchaser  for six (6) months after the
Closing  Date,  or (ii)  terminated  by Purchaser  without  cause within six (6)
months after the Closing  Date,  shall  receive a lump sum payment  equal to the
lump sum  payment  that  otherwise  would have been  payable to such  Transition
Business Employee pursuant to the terms of that Transition  Business  Employee's
Original Retention  Agreement had the Transition  Business Employee not accepted
an offer of employment  with Purchaser as of the Closing Date.  Purchaser  shall
promptly  make all payments due or owing to the  Transition  Business  Employees
under the Amended Retention  Agreements and shall provide notice to Circuit City
regarding the total payments made along with supporting documentation reasonably
satisfactory  to Circuit City.  Within ten (10) business days following  Circuit
City's receipt of such notice and supporting  documentation,  Circuit City shall
reimburse  Purchaser  for the amount of the total  payments made by Purchaser to
the Transition Business Employees pursuant to this Section 7.18(k).

     SECTION 7.19. Further Assurances.

     (a) After the Closing Date, each of Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding, and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts from time to time to execute
and  deliver at the  reasonable  request of the other  Parties  such  additional
documents and instruments (including any assignments,  bills of sale, assumption
agreements, consents and other similar instruments in addition to those required
by  this  Agreement)  as may be  reasonably  required  to  give  effect  to this
Agreement  and  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby,  to  provide  whatever
documents  or other  evidence of  ownership  as may be  reasonably  requested by
Purchaser  to  confirm  Purchaser's  ownership  of the  Purchased  Assets and to
provide whatever  documents or other evidence as may be reasonably  requested by
Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding or their  respective  Affiliates to confirm
Purchaser's  assumption  of the  Assumed  Liabilities.  On and after the Closing
Date,  Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding,  and  Purchaser  shall  give such
reasonable  further  assurances  to the  other  Parties  and  their  Affiliates,
respectively,   and   shall   execute,   acknowledge   and   deliver   all  such
acknowledgments  and other  instruments  and take such further  action as may be
reasonably  necessary  and  appropriate  effectively  to relieve  and  discharge
Purchaser from any Retained Liability and Circuit City, FNANB, Tyler Funding and
their respective Affiliates from any Assumed Liabilities, respectively.

     (b) Each Party agrees to use its respective commercially reasonable efforts
and to  proceed  diligently  to  obtain  at or  prior  to the  Closing  Date any
consents, licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations or exemptions required in
connection  with the  execution  or delivery by such Party,  and the validity or
enforceability,  of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby,
and otherwise satisfy each of the conditions set forth in this Article VII

                                       65

that is applicable  to it or any of its  Affiliates.  Each Party shall  promptly
notify the others if any such consent, license, permit, approval,  authorization
or  exemption  is  declined,  denied or delayed.  Each Party  agrees to promptly
inform the others of any circumstances  that create or give rise to a reasonable
likelihood that any such consent,  license, permit, approval or authorization or
exemption will not be obtained at or prior to the time the same must be obtained
in order to permit the transactions contemplated herein to be consummated on the
Closing Date.

     SECTION 7.20.  Limitations on Duties.  Circuit City, FNANB,  Tyler Funding,
and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to perform such
duties and only such duties as are  specifically set forth in this Agreement and
no implied  covenants or obligations  shall be read into this Agreement  against
such Parties.

     SECTION 7.21. Covenant to Comply with Account Agreements.  On and after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will comply with the terms and conditions of the Account
Agreements,  as they may be amended by Purchaser  from time to time  (subject to
the Program Agreement),  the Operating  Regulations and all laws and regulations
applicable to the Purchased Assets.

     SECTION 7.22. Assumed Liabilities. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall discharge the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with the terms thereof.

     SECTION 7.23. Credit Insurance Policies.

     (a) No Insurance Contract shall be an Assumed Contract without  Purchaser's
written  consent.  Complete and current  copies (as of the Closing Date) of each
(i) group  master  policy  issued  pursuant  to the  Insurance  Contracts,  (ii)
certificate  of  insurance  issued  under such group  master  policy,  and (iii)
individual  credit insurance policy associated with Accounts and issued pursuant
to the Insurance  Contracts (the "Credit Insurance  Policies") shall be provided
to Purchaser  within  thirty (30) days after the Closing  Date.  The  agreements
referenced in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are referred to  collectively as
"Policies".

     (b) From the date  hereof  through  the  Closing  Date,  Sellers  shall use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause each Insurance Contract and Policy to
remain in effect and shall not change any terms thereof; provided, however, that
terms  of any  Insurance  Contract  or  Policy  may be  changed  and  individual
Borrowers'  coverages may be suspended or  terminated in the ordinary  course of
business  consistent with past practice.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,  from the date hereof  through the Closing  Date,  Sellers  shall not
change coverage, services, pricing, or other features of any Policies; provided,
however,  that such  terms may be  modified,  and  individual  coverages  may be
suspended or terminated, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.  From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Sellers shall maintain
any and all  existing  procedures  relating to  services,  claims  adjudication,
claims activation and payments for Credit Insurance Policies; provided, however,
that  such  procedures  may  be  changed  in the  ordinary  course  of  business
consistent with past practice.

     (c) From the date hereof through the Closing Date,  Sellers  shall,  to the
extent  commercially   reasonable,   cooperate  with  Purchaser  in  either,  at
Purchaser's discretion,

                                       66

(i) assigning the Policies to Purchaser, or the benefits thereunder,  at Closing
or (ii)  converting  such  Policies  to  another  insurance  policy or  policies
maintained by Purchaser,  which shall take effect as of the Closing Date. In the
case of clause (c)(i), the assigned Policies shall become Assumed Contracts.

     (d) Upon the request of  Purchaser,  (i) Sellers shall  terminate,  or have
terminated,  all reinsurance agreements covering any credit insurance related to
the Accounts, between Sellers or any of its Affiliates and any insurance company
("Credit  Insurance  Reinsurance  Agreements"),  or (ii)  subject  to the mutual
agreement of the Parties negotiating in good faith, before the Closing,  Sellers
shall (1) assign to  Purchaser's  designee(s),  effective as of the Closing Date
and on terms mutually agreed to by the Parties in their commercially  reasonable
discretion,  all Credit Insurance Reinsurance  Agreements,  (2) use commercially
reasonable  efforts to obtain the  consent  to such  assignment(s)  of the third
party insurance  companies that are parties to the Credit Insurance  Reinsurance
Agreements,  and (3) no later  than  thirty  (30) days after the  Closing  Date,
compute and transfer to Purchaser's  designee, by electronic fund transfer to an
account  designated by such designee,  reserves in an amount  mutually agreed by
the  Parties in their  commercially  reasonable  discretion  based on normal and
customary  actuarial  practices  and in an  amount  sufficient  to  fulfill  the
obligations and liabilities  associated with the Credit Insurance  Policies.  In
the case of clause (d)(ii), the assigned Credit Insurance Reinsurance Agreements
shall become Assumed  Contracts.  If the Parties cannot reach agreement for such
assignment(s) on or before the Closing Date,  Sellers shall terminate the Credit
Insurance Reinsurance Agreements, effective as of the Closing Date.

     (e) Subject to the mutual  agreement  of the Parties,  negotiating  in good
faith, Sellers shall assign or cause to be assigned, effective as of the Closing
Date,  each  of  the  Insurance  Contracts,  other  than  the  Credit  Insurance
Reinsurance  Agreements  which  shall be  subject to the  provisions  of Section
7.23(d).  In that case, the assigned  Insurance  Contracts  shall become Assumed
Contracts.  In the  event  that  the  Parties  cannot  reach  an  agreement  for
assignment under this Section 7.23(e) of any of the Insurance Contracts,  Seller
shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date any such Insurance Contract not
assigned and Purchaser  may establish  replacement  contracts  with  appropriate
third parties.

     (f) After  Closing,  Purchaser  shall have the right to make changes at its
sole  discretion  to the Credit  Insurance  Policies  and the related  services.
Without  limiting  the  foregoing,  after  Closing,  Purchaser  may, in its sole
discretion,  seek to (1)  continue  the  assigned  Policies  and enter  into new
contracts  with the  insurers  of the  assigned  Policies;  or (2)  convert  the
insurance to another  insurance  policy, in compliance with Requirements of Law.
In any case, the  administrative  and, subject to transfer of the reserve amount
contemplated by Section 7.23(d)(ii)(3), financial obligations and Liabilities of
Circuit  City,  Sellers  and  their  respective  Affiliates  in  respect  of the
Policies,  Credit Insurance  Agreement,  Insurance Contracts and Sellers' credit
insurance  program  shall  terminate as of the Cut-Off  Time.  Sellers shall use
commercially  reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably
request in effecting  the  transition  for Borrowers  from the Credit  Insurance
Policies in effect prior to Closing to those in effect afterwards.  If Purchaser
determines to convert the assigned Policies to another  insurance  policy,  such
conversion  shall  not be  effective  until  after  Closing.  Seller  shall  use
commercially  reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in changing the name of the
creditor from Seller to Purchaser under such assigned Policies.

                                       67

     (g) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,  Purchaser  shall
give  notice  to each  Borrower  in  accordance  with  all  Requirements  of Law
concerning the actions taken under this Section 7.23.

     (h) It is the intent of the Parties in this Section  7.23,  that all of the
rights and/or economic benefits  currently held or received by Sellers or any of
their  Affiliates  related to or arising out of the  Insurance  Contracts or the
Policies be transferred in full to Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing
Date, on terms mutually agreed by the Parties in their  commercially  reasonable
discretion  (but  without any  additional  consideration  therefore by Purchaser
other than the  Purchase  Price paid by  Purchaser  hereunder),  and the Parties
agree to  execute  such  documents,  and take such  actions,  as are  reasonably
necessary or appropriate to effect such  transfer(s).  Any such actions shall be
conducted in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.

     SECTION 7.24. Credit Protector Contracts.

     (a) From the date  hereof  through  the  Closing  Date,  Sellers  shall use
commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause each  Credit  Protector  Contract  to
remain in effect and shall not change the terms thereof; provided, however, that
terms of any Credit Protector Contract may be changed and individual  Borrowers'
coverages  may be suspended  or  terminated  in the ordinary  course of business
consistent with past practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
from the date  hereof  through  the  Closing  Date,  Sellers  shall  not  change
coverage, services, pricing, or other features of any Credit Protector Contract;
provided, however, that such terms may be modified, and individual coverages may
be suspended or terminated in the ordinary  course of business  consistent  with
past  practice.  From the date hereof  through the Closing  Date,  Sellers shall
maintain  any  and  all  existing  procedures   relating  to  services,   claims
adjudication,  claims  activation and payments for Credit  Protector  Contracts;
provided, however, that such procedures may be changed in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

     (b) From the date hereof through the Closing Date,  Sellers  shall,  to the
extent  commercially  reasonable,  cooperate with Purchaser in replacing Sellers
with Purchaser as a party to such Credit Protector  Contracts,  said replacement
to be effective as of the Closing Date.

     (c) Subject to the mutual  agreement  of the Parties,  negotiating  in good
faith, before the Closing,  Sellers shall (i) either (1) cancel, effective as of
the Closing Date,  any  contingent  liability  policy  created for Sellers' debt
cancellation/suspension  program,  or (2) assign,  or cause to be  assigned,  an
equivalent  liability  policy  to  Purchaser  or its  designee,  and  shall  use
commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain the consent to such assignment of the
insurer  thereunder  and (ii) no later than  thirty  (30) days after the Closing
Date,  compute and transfer to  Purchaser,  by  electronic  fund  transfer to an
account  designated by Purchaser,  reserves in an amount  mutually agreed by the
Parties in their commercially  reasonable  discretion,  determined in accordance
with normal and customary  actuarial  practices  and in an amount  sufficient to
fulfill  the  obligations  and  liabilities  associated  with  Credit  Protector
Contracts in an active benefit status at the time of the Closing. In the case of
clause (c)(2),  the assigned  contingent  liability  policy shall become Assumed
Contracts.

                                       68

     (d) If the Parties  cannot reach an agreement  as  contemplated  by Section
7.24(c),  then Sellers shall  terminate,  effective as of the Closing Date,  the
Credit Protector Contracts, any contingent liability policy created for Sellers'
debt  cancellation/suspension  program  and  any  other  agreements  related  to
Sellers' debt cancellation/suspension program.

     (e) If  Sellers  are  replaced  by  Purchaser  as the  party to the  Credit
Protector Contracts as contemplated by Section 7.24(c)(i), such Credit Protector
Contracts  shall be Assumed  Contracts.  In any case,  the  administrative  and,
subject to transfer of the reserve amount  contemplated by Section  7.24(d)(ii),
financial  obligations  and  Liabilities  of  Circuit  City,  Sellers  and their
respective  Affiliates in respect of the Credit Protector Contracts and Sellers'
credit debt  cancellation/suspension  program shall  terminate as of the Cut-Off
Time.

     (f) No later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date,  Purchaser  shall
give  notice  to each  Borrower  in  accordance  with  all  Requirements  of Law
concerning the actions taken under this Section 7.24.

     SECTION 7.25. Fleet Interim Servicing  Agreement.  Sellers and Circuit City
shall take all actions  necessary  to ensure that any  agreement  or  activities
relating to the  interim  servicing  of assets sold  thereby to Fleet Bank (RI),
National  Association  or any Affiliate  thereof do not create any  obligations,
actual or contingent, that apply to Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.

     SECTION 7.26.  Status of the Trust.  Sellers and Circuit City (i) shall not
take any  action on behalf of the Trust (or cause the Trust to take any  action)
that would  reasonably  be  expected  to cause the Trust to fail to qualify as a
qualifying  special  purpose entity under  applicable  accounting  guidelines in
effect on the date of this  Agreement and (ii) shall take such actions on behalf
of the Trust (or cause the Trust to take such  actions) as may be  necessary  to
ensure that the Trust does not fail to qualify as a qualifying  special  purpose
entity  under such  accounting  guidelines.  If there is a change in  applicable
accounting  guidelines  between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
Sellers and Circuit City shall take such reasonable  actions as may be requested
by  Purchaser  to ensure that the Trust does not fail to qualify as a qualifying
special  purpose  entity  under such  changed  accounting  guidelines  (it being
understood  that  Sellers and Circuit  City shall only be obligated to take such
actions as they would  reasonably  be expected to take to maintain the status of
the Trust as a qualifying  special  purpose entity if this Agreement were not in
effect).

     SECTION 7.27. Pre-Closing Initiatives; Pre-Closing Transition Activities.

     (a) From the date  hereof  through the Closing  Date,  FNANB and  Purchaser
shall each use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to support the pre-closing
initiatives set forth in Exhibit N (the  "Pre-Closing  Initiatives").  FNANB and
Purchaser shall jointly determine which Business  Employees shall be assigned to
work on the Pre-Closing Initiatives and how much time is to be allocated by such
Business Employees to the tasks assigned.

     (b) From the date  hereof  through the Closing  Date,  FNANB and  Purchaser
shall each use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to complete the pre-closing
transition  activities  set  forth in  Exhibit  S (the  "Pre-Closing  Transition
Activities").

                                       69

     (c) The Pre-Closing Initiatives and Pre-Closing Transition Activities shall
be subject to the approval, or supervisory non-objection, of the OCC.

     SECTION 7.28.  Amendment of Circuit City Interest Rate Caps. On or prior to

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TAX MATTERS

     SECTION 8.01. Liability for Taxes; Refunds and Credits.

     (a) Circuit City shall be responsible for and shall indemnify Purchaser and
its Affiliates  (excluding the Trust) (the "Purchaser Tax Indemnitees") from and
against all:

         (i) Excluded Taxes; and

         (ii) Taxes resulting from any breach of any covenant by Circuit City or
     any  Seller  contained  in this  Article  VIII (but then only to the extent
     appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Circuit City, on the one hand,
     and Purchaser, on the other hand, with respect to such Tax);

For the absence of doubt,  the Trust itself shall have no right or claim against
Circuit  City  under  this  Section  8.01(a).  Circuit  City (or a member of the
Circuit  City  Affiliated  Group or the Circuit  City Group,  as  designated  by
Circuit  City) shall be  entitled to any refunds (or  credits) of or against any
Excluded  Taxes or any other Taxes for which Circuit City is  responsible  under
this  Section  8.01(a)  and any refund (or  credit) to the extent so provided in
Section 8.09.

     (b) Purchaser  shall be responsible  for and shall  indemnify,  jointly and
severally,  Circuit City, FNANB,  Tyler Funding and their respective  Affiliates
(the "Seller Tax Indemnitees") from and against all:

         (i) Taxes of or  relating to the Credit Card  Business,  the  Purchased
     Assets or the Trust (or their  respective  assets)  with  respect  to (A) a
     Post-Closing Tax Period or (B) the portion of the Straddle Period deemed to
     begin on or after the Closing  Date (in the manner  determined  pursuant to
     Section 8.02(c) hereof).

         (ii) Taxes  resulting  from any  breach of any  covenant  by  Purchaser
     contained in Section 2.07 or this Article VIII (but then only to the extent
     appropriate  to reflect the relative  fault of Purchaser,  on the one hand,
     and Circuit City, on the other hand, with respect to such Tax), and

         (iii) Taxes  described  in clause (a), (b) or (c) of the proviso of the
     definition of Excluded Taxes.

     Purchaser and its Affiliates  shall be entitled to any refunds (or credits)
of or against Taxes of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Trust) except
for (x) refunds (or credits) of Taxes of the Trust received or credited prior to
the Closing Date (except to the extent, if any, that such

                                       70

refunds  or  credits  are  reflected  as a Tax  asset  on  the  Settlement  Date
Statement)  and (y) any other  refunds  (or  credits) to which  Circuit  City is
entitled to under Section 8.01(a).

     (c) Circuit City and Purchaser agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve any disputes  relating to the relative  fault of each party for Taxes
under this Section 8.01. In the absence of agreement by the parties on the level
of relative fault,  Circuit City and Purchaser agree to mediate any dispute in a
manner consistent with Section 4.04 hereof.

     SECTION 8.02. Filing Responsibility.

     (a) Circuit City shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
when due:

         (i) all  consolidated,  combined,  affiliated or unitary Tax Returns of
     the Circuit City Affiliated Group,

         (ii) any Tax Return of, or which  includes,  Circuit City or any member
     of the Circuit  City Group,  whether  combined,  consolidated,  affiliated,
     unitary or otherwise,

         (iii)  any  Tax  Return  relating  to the  Credit  Card  Business,  the
     Purchased  Assets or the Trust  required  to be filed  prior to the Closing
     Date, and

         (iv) any  other  Tax  Return  of or with  respect  to the  Credit  Card
     Business,  the  Purchased  Assets  or the  Trust  (or its  assets)  for any
     Pre-Closing Tax Period.

Circuit  City shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due and payable in respect
of all such Tax Returns (subject to any indemnification obligations of Purchaser
under this Article VIII).

     (b) Purchaser  shall,  except to the extent that filing such Tax Returns is
the  responsibility of Circuit City under Section 8.02(a),  prepare and file, or
cause to be  prepared  and filed,  all Tax  Returns  relating to the Credit Card
Business,  the  Purchased  Assets and the Trust (or its  assets) for the taxable
periods  beginning on or after the Closing  Date.  In the case of any Tax Return
required to be prepared and filed by Purchaser  pursuant to this  subsection for
which any Taxes are the responsibility of Circuit City, such Tax Return shall be
prepared  and filed in a manner that is  consistent  with  Circuit  City's prior
practices,  if any,  or in a manner  to which  Circuit  City has given its prior
written  consent,  such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld,  and Purchaser
shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return to Circuit City for its review at least
thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax Return  (taking into
account  valid  extensions)  and shall  provide  Circuit  City with  Purchasers'
calculation,  in reasonable  detail,  of Circuit  City's share of the Taxes with
respect  to such Tax  Return  (determined  in the case of a  Straddle  Period in
accordance with Section  8.02(c));  provided,  however,  that such drafts of any
such Tax Return and such  calculations of Circuit City's share of the Taxes with
respect  to such Tax  Return  shall be  subject  to  Circuit  City's  review and
approval,  which approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or
delayed. If Circuit City disputes any Tax Item on such Tax Return or Purchasers'
calculation  of  Circuit  City's  share of the Taxes  with  respect  to such Tax
Return,  it shall notify  Purchaser (by written  notice within ten (10) Business
Days of receipt of Purchasers' calculation) of such disputed item (or items) and
the basis for its objection.  Circuit City and Purchaser shall act in good faith
to  resolve  any such  dispute  prior to the date on  which  the Tax  Return  is
required to be filed. If

                                       71

Circuit  City and  Purchaser  cannot  resolve  any  disputed  item,  the item in
question  shall be resolved by the  Accountant in accordance  with the standards
set forth in this  Section  8.02(b) as  promptly  as  practicable.  The fees and
expenses  of the  Accountant  shall  be  shared  equally  by  Circuit  City  and
Purchaser.  In the event the disputed item cannot be resolved in accordance with
this Section 8.02(b) prior to the date on which the Tax Return is required to be
filed,  Purchaser  shall timely file such Tax Return and pay or cause to be paid
to the applicable Tax authority all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Tax
Return required to be prepared by Purchaser  pursuant to this  subsection.  Upon
resolution  of the dispute  pursuant  to Section  4.04,  Circuit  City shall pay
immediately to Purchaser its determined share of Taxes in immediately  available
funds.

     (c) In order to apportion  appropriately  any Taxes  relating to a Straddle
Period  between the portion of such  Straddle  Period  ending before the Closing
Date and the portion of such Straddle Period  beginning on and after the Closing
Date, the Parties shall,  to the extent  permitted  under  applicable law, elect
with the relevant Tax  authority to treat for all Tax purposes the day preceding
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable  period.  In the case of any other
Taxes for a Straddle  Period for which such election to close the taxable period
is not permitted, the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to the portion of
the Straddle  Period ending before the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of
ad valorem or similar Taxes that are imposed on a periodic  basis,  deemed to be
the amount of such Taxes for the entire  period  (or,  in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis (such as real property taxes), the amount of such
Taxes  for the  immediately  preceding  period)  multiplied  by a  fraction  the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle  Period  ending  before
the  Closing  Date and the  denominator  of which is the  number  of days in the
entire relevant Straddle Period;  and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in
(i) (such as Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income, receipts
or premiums,  or (y) imposed in  connection  with any sale or other  transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), deemed equal
to the  amount  that would be payable if the  taxable  period  ended  before the
Closing Date; provided,  however, that Transfer Taxes shall be allocated between
and paid by the parties in accordance with Section 8.05.

     SECTION 8.03. Cooperation; Exchange of Information; Tax Proceedings.

     (a) The Parties shall  cooperate with each other and furnish or cause to be
furnished  to each  other,  upon  request,  as  promptly  as  practicable,  such
information  (including access to books and records) and assistance  relating to
the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Trust (or its assets) as is reasonably
requested for the preparation or filing of any Tax Returns,  for the preparation
or conduct of any Tax Proceeding and for the  satisfaction  of legitimate Tax or
accounting   requirements.   Such  cooperation  and  information  shall  include
Purchasers'  facilitation  of Circuit  City's  exercise of its rights under this
Article VIII to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, Tax Returns
of the Credit Card Business,  the Purchased Assets, or the Trust and conduct Tax
Proceedings  relating  thereto (for example,  by way of execution of appropriate
powers of attorney in favor of Circuit City or by  designation  of an officer of
Circuit City as an officer of the Trust for such purposes).

     (b) Notwithstanding the definition of Books and Records, Purchaser shall be
entitled  to  copies  of any  Tax  work  papers  of the  Trust  that  are in the
possession of Circuit City or any

                                       72

Subsidiary  of  Circuit  City.  Circuit  City  shall be  entitled  to retain all
original Tax Returns and Tax work papers relating to FNANB,  Tyler Funding,  the
Trust or the Purchased Assets.

     (c) Circuit  City and  Purchaser  shall,  and shall cause their  respective
Subsidiaries  to,  cooperate  in the  preparation  of all Tax  Returns  that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date relating to Pre-Closing  Tax Periods
or to Straddle Periods and any Tax Returns of the Trust.

     (d) Purchaser  shall promptly notify Circuit City upon receipt by Purchaser
or any of its  Subsidiaries  (including  the  Trust)  of  notice  of any  claim,
assessment or dispute  relating to any Tax Proceeding for which Circuit City has
liability  pursuant  to Section  8.01(a)  (or  relating to refunds or credits to
which Circuit City or any member of the Circuit City Affiliated Group or Circuit
City  Group  is  entitled)  and  shall  promptly  forward  to  Circuit  City any
communications received from or sent to any Tax authority in connection with any
such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that a failure by Purchaser to give such
notice will not affect the Purchaser Tax Indemnitees'  rights to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.01(a) except to the extent Circuit City is prejudiced as a
consequence of such failure.

     (e) Circuit City shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and
defend, at Circuit City's sole expense, any Tax Proceeding (including having the
right to determine whether, when and on what terms to settle any Tax Proceeding)
with  respect to (i) any  consolidated,  combined,  affiliated  or  unitary  Tax
Returns (or Taxes) of the Circuit City Affiliated Group; (ii) any Tax Return of,
or which includes,  (or Taxes of) Circuit City or any member of the Circuit City
Group,  whether  combined,  consolidated,   unitary,  affiliated  or  otherwise;
provided,  however,  the  Tax  Proceeding  does  not  include  a Tax  Return  of
Purchaser;  and (iii)  the Trust for a  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period.  Any  expenses
incurred by  Purchaser in  connection  with any Tax  Proceeding  covered by this
Section 8.03(e) shall be borne by Purchaser.

     (f) In the case of (A) any Tax Proceeding with respect to Taxes  concerning
the  Credit  Card  Business,  the  Purchased  Assets or the Trust for a Straddle
Period (other than a Tax Proceeding covered by Section 8.03(e) above) or (B) any
Tax Proceeding relating to the Credit Card Business,  the Trust or the Purchased
Assets (other than a Tax Proceeding  covered by Section 8.03(e) above) for which
Circuit  City may have  liability  pursuant to Section  8.01(a) (or  relating to
refunds or  credits to which  Circuit  City or any  member of the  Circuit  City

     borne by Circuit City if the Tax authority were  successful with respect to
     such claim in the Tax  Proceeding  (a "Circuit City Tax Claim") and a claim
     for Taxes  which  would be borne by  Purchaser  if the Tax  authority  were
     successful  with respect to such claim in the Tax  Proceeding (a "Purchaser
     Tax Claim") and the  relevant  Tax  authority  agrees to permit the Circuit

     settled,  then (x) the Circuit City Tax Claim and the  Purchaser  Tax Claim
     shall be separately  contested,  (y) Circuit City shall be the  Controlling

     shall apply with respect to the Tax Proceeding in

         (ii) if the Tax  Proceeding  involves  a  Circuit  City Tax Claim and a
     Purchaser  Tax Claim and the Circuit City Tax Claim is not  separable  from
     the Purchaser Tax Claim,  then the Controlling  Party shall be whichever of
     Circuit City and Purchaser  would bear the greater Tax with respect to such
     Tax Proceeding if the Tax authority were  successful in the Tax Proceeding,
     the Non-Controlling  Party shall be whichever of Circuit City and Purchaser
     are not the Controlling Party (unless the Tax Proceeding is with respect to
     a Tax Return of a consolidated,  combined,  unitary or affiliated  group of
     which Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (other than the Trust) is the
     common parent,  in which case the Controlling  Party shall be Purchaser and
     the  Non-Controlling  Party shall be Circuit  City) and the  provisions  of
     Section 8.03(g) shall apply,

         (iii) if the Tax Proceeding  involves  solely a Circuit City Tax Claim,
     then Circuit City shall be the  Controlling  Party,  Purchaser shall be the

     Return of a consolidated,  combined,  unitary or affiliated  group of which
     Purchaser  or any  Affiliate  of  Purchaser  (other  than the Trust) is the
     common parent,  in which case the Controlling  Party shall be Purchaser and
     the  Non-Controlling  Party shall be Circuit  City) and the  provisions  of
     Section 8.03(g) below shall apply and

         (iv) if the Tax Proceeding  involves solely a Purchaser Tax Claim, then
     Purchaser  shall  be the  Controlling  Party,  Circuit  City  shall  be the
     Non-Controlling  Party and the  provisions  of Section  8.03(g) below shall
     apply.

     (g) The Controlling Party may elect to control, contest, resolve and defend
any Tax  Proceeding  as to which such  party is the  Controlling  Party.  If the
Controlling  Party  desires to elect to  control  any such Tax  Proceeding,  the
Controlling  Party shall,  within  fifteen (15)  Business Days of receipt of the
notice  of the Tax  Proceeding  from the  Non-Controlling  Party or from the Tax
authority,  notify the Non-Controlling  Party in writing of its intent to do so.
If the Controlling Party timely elects to control any such Tax Proceeding,  then
the  Controlling  Party shall have the right to determine  whether,  when and on
what terms to settle such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that

         (i) the Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling  Party with
     a  timely  and  reasonably  detailed  account  of each  stage  of such  Tax
     Proceeding,

                                       74

         (iv) the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding  diligently
     and in good  faith as if the  Controlling  Party were  responsible  for 100
     percent of the Taxes claimed to be due in the Tax Proceeding,

         (v) in  the  case  of  Tax  Proceedings  covered  by the  parenthetical
     language in Section  8.03(f)(ii) or (iii), the consent of Circuit City, not
     to be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  or delayed,  shall be required
     prior to the submission of any written  materials  prepared or furnished in
     connection  with such Tax  Proceedings  that relate to the Circuit City Tax
     Claim, and

         (vi) except in the case of Tax Proceedings covered by the parenthetical
     language in Section  8.03(f)(ii) or (iii), the Controlling  Party shall not
     settle  such Tax  Proceeding  without  the  consent of the  Non-Controlling
     Party, not to be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed;  provided,
     however,  that if the  Non-Controlling  Party  withholds  its  consent to a
     proposed  settlement  under this clause (vi), then the Controlling  Party's
     Liability  with  respect  to such Tax  Proceeding  shall be  limited to the
     amount that such Liability would have been under such proposed settlement.

If the Controlling  Party does not elect to control a Tax Proceeding which it is
entitled to control pursuant to this subsection (or, after assuming control, the
Controlling  Party fails to pursue  such Tax  Proceeding),  the  Non-Controlling
Party may, without  affecting any rights to  indemnification  under this Article
VIII,  assume and control  such Tax  Proceeding;  provided,  however,  that such
Non-Controlling  Party may not settle such Tax Proceeding without the consent of
the  Controlling  Party,  which  consent  shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided further, however, that if the Controlling Party
withholds its consent to a proposed settlement, then the Non-Controlling Party's
Liability  with  respect to such Tax  Proceeding  shall be limited to the amount
that such Liability would have been under such proposed settlement.

     The  Controlling  Party  shall bear any  expenses  incurred  by it, and the
Non-Controlling Party shall bear any expenses incurred by it, in connection with
any Tax Proceeding to which this Section 8.03(g) applies.

     (h)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this Agreement or the Related
Agreements,   neither   Purchaser,   the  Trust  nor  any  of  their  respective
Subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  shall  be  entitled  to  participate  in  any  Tax
Proceeding with respect to any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax
Return which includes  Circuit City or any member of the Circuit City Affiliated
Group or the Circuit  City Group,  and neither  Purchaser,  the Trust nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be entitled to any information
regarding  or copy of any such Tax  Return,  except to the extent  that such Tax
Proceeding or Tax Return relates solely to the Trust.

     SECTION 8.04. Tax Sharing Agreements. Notwithstanding anything in any other
agreement to the contrary,  all liabilities and obligations between Circuit City
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Trust), on the one hand, and the Trust,
on the other hand,  under any Tax allocation or Tax sharing  agreement in effect
prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement)  shall cease and terminate
as of the Closing Date.

all  documentary,  sales,  use, real  property  transfer,  real property  gains,

and costs together with any interest thereon,  penalties,  fines,  costs,  fees,
additions  to tax  or  additional  amounts  with  respect  thereto  incurred  in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  ("Transfer
Taxes").  Circuit City shall be responsible  for preparing and timely filing any
Tax Returns  required with respect to any such Transfer  Taxes.  Purchaser shall
cooperate  with Circuit  City and its  Affiliates  in preparing  and filing such
forms or statements  necessary to secure all available  exemptions from Transfer
Taxes  which,  but for such  exemption,  would be  incurred  by or imposed  upon
Circuit City or its Affiliates in connection with the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.06. Survival.  All rights and obligations under this Article VIII
shall  survive the  Closing  Date and  continue  until sixty (60) days after the
expiration  of all  applicable  statutes  of  limitation  (including  extensions
thereof);  provided,  however, that if written notice of any bona fide claim for
indemnification  under this  Article  VIII  shall have been given in  accordance
herewith within the applicable  survival period, the rights and obligations that
are the subject of such claim for indemnification  shall survive with respect to
such claim until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

     SECTION  8.07.  Post-Closing  Dispositions.  For the absence of doubt,  the
covenants of Purchaser  and the Trust set forth in this Article VIII shall apply
to Purchaser and the Trust  regardless of any  post-Closing  disposition  of the
Trust by Purchaser or any of their Affiliates.

     SECTION 8.08. Tax Treatment of Payments.  Circuit City, Purchaser and their
respective  Affiliates  shall treat any and all payments under this Article VIII
or Article IV or Article X (and the amount of any Receivables posted to accounts
on or  prior  to the  Closing  Date  but on or  after  the  Cut-Off  Time) as an
adjustment to the Purchase  Price for all Tax purposes  unless they are required
to treat such  payments  otherwise  pursuant to a  determination  (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar state or local Tax law).

     SECTION 8.09. Recovered Sales Taxes on Charged-Off Accounts.  Purchaser and
Circuit City shall cooperate with one another,  and each shall use  commercially
reasonable  efforts,  to seek to obtain  refunds  of sales tax with  respect  to
Account balances that are charged off by FNANB prior to the Cut-Off Time, but no
Party will be obligated to take any action which it  determines,  reasonably and
in good faith,  would violate any  Requirement of Law. Sales tax recoveries with
respect to such charged-off Account balances will belong 100% to Circuit City or
one of Circuit City's Affiliates, as applicable.

direct claim) any and all Damages  resulting  from,  arising out of, or relating
to: (i) the Retained Liabilities; (ii) the Retained Assets; (iii) the inaccuracy
of any  representation  or the breach of any warranty of Circuit City,  FNANB or

Account Agreement or Account  Agreements that are the subject of a claim made by
a third party.

     SECTION 10.03.  Indemnification  Obligations  of Purchaser.  Subject to the
terms of this Article X, from and after the Closing  Date,  Purchaser  agrees to
jointly and severally  indemnify,  defend, save, and hold harmless Circuit City,
FNANB and Tyler Funding and their  respective  Affiliates  and their  respective
officers,  directors  and  employees  ("Seller  Indemnified  Parties")  from and
against  (whether in connection  with a third party claim or a direct claim) any
and all Damages resulting from,  arising out of, or relating to: (i) the Assumed
Liabilities,  (ii) the  inaccuracy  of any  representation  or the breach of any

Agreements   (excluding  the  Licensing  Agreement,   Gateway  Software  License
Agreement,  Sublease of the Leased Real Property,  Richmond Sublease and Program
Agreement,  each of which shall  stand on its own);  (iv) the  operation  of the
Credit  Card  Business  after the  Cut-Off  Time,  including  liability  for any
securities law violations committed after the Cut-Off Time; (v) operation of the
Trust  after the Cut-Off  Time;  and (vi) any action  taken by any  Governmental
Authority as a result of the actions or omissions of Purchaser  occurring  after
the Cut-Off Time.

     SECTION 10.04. Claims.

     (a) Notice of Third Party  Claims.  The parties  agree that if any claim is
made,  any suit or action is commenced,  or any knowledge is received of a state
of facts which,  if not corrected,  may give rise to a right of  indemnification
for such party  hereunder  (an  "Indemnified  Party")  from the other party (the
"Indemnifying  Party"),  the  Indemnified  Party will give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable after the receipt

                                       82

by the Indemnified  Party of notice or knowledge of such claim,  suit, action or
state of facts.  Notice to the Indemnifying  Party under the preceding  sentence
shall be given no later than 15 days after receipt by the  Indemnified  Party of
service of process if a suit or action has  commenced or 30 days under all other
circumstances.   The  failure  to  give  prompt  notice  shall  not  relieve  an
Indemnifying  Party of its  obligation  to  indemnify  except to the  extent the
Indemnifying  Party is  prejudiced by such  failure.  Such written  notice shall
describe  such  claim  in  reasonable  detail  including  the  sections  of this
Agreement  that form the basis of such  claim,  copies of all  material  written
evidence  thereof,  and the estimated  amount of the Damages that have or may be
sustained by the Indemnified  Party. The Indemnified  Party shall make available
to the  Indemnifying  Party and its counsel and accountants at reasonable  times
and for reasonable periods,  during normal business hours, all books and records
of  the   Indemnified   Party   relating   to  any  such   possible   claim  for
indemnification,  and  each  party  hereunder  will  render  to the  other  such
assistance as it may  reasonably  require of the other in order to insure prompt
and  adequate  defense of any suit,  claim or  proceeding  based upon a state of
facts  which  may  give  rise  to a  right  of  indemnification  hereunder.  The
Indemnifying  Party  shall have the right to defend,  compromise  and settle any
third party suit,  claim or proceeding in the name of the  Indemnified  Party to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party may be liable to the Indemnified Party in
connection therewith.  The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
within 30 days of having been notified  pursuant to this Section 10.04(a) if the
Indemnifying  Party  elects to assume  the  defense of any such  claim,  suit or
proceeding and employ  counsel.  The  Indemnified  Party shall have the right to
employ  its own  counsel  if the  Indemnifying  Party so elects  to assume  such
defense,  but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the  Indemnified
Party's sole expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to compromise or
defend any such claim,  it shall promptly  notify the  Indemnified  Party of its
intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or defense against, any
such claim;  provided,  however,  that the Indemnifying  Party shall not settle,
compromise, or discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such claim
without the prior written consent of the  Indemnified  Party (which consent will
not be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed)  unless the relief consists solely of
money  damages and includes a provision  where the  plaintiff or claimant in the
matter releases the Indemnified  Party from all liability with respect  thereto.
Notwithstanding  an election to assume the defense of such action or proceeding,
the  Indemnifying  Party shall have the right to employ separate  counsel and to
participate  in the defense of such action or proceeding,  and the  Indemnifying
Party  shall bear the  reasonable  fees,  costs and  expenses  of such  separate
counsel if (i) the Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith that an
actual or potential  conflict of interest makes such  representation by the same
counsel or the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate, or (ii)
the  Indemnifying  Party shall have authorized the  Indemnified  Party to employ
separate  counsel  at  the  Indemnifying  Party's  expense.  In any  event,  the
Indemnified  Party and  Indemnifying  Party and their counsel shall cooperate in
the  defense  of any claim  subject  to this  Article  X and keep  such  Persons
informed of all developments  relating to any such claims, and provide copies of
all relevant  correspondence  and documentation  relating thereto.  Also, in any
event,  the  Indemnified  Party  shall  have  the  right at its own  expense  to
participate in the defense of such asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party
receiving  such  notice of claim does not elect to defend such claim or does not
defend such claim in good faith, the Indemnified  Party shall have the right, in
addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, to

                                       83

defend such claim;  provided,  however, that (i) the Indemnified Party shall not
have any obligation to participate in the defense of, or defend, any such claim;
(ii) the Indemnified  Party's defense of or  participation in the defense of any
such  claim  shall not in any way  diminish  or lessen  the  obligations  of the
Indemnifying  Party under this Article X; and (iii) the Indemnified  Party shall
not settle,  compromise,  or discharge,  or admit any liability with respect to,
any such claim  without the written  consent of the  Indemnifying  Party  (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

     (b) Direct Claims. Each Party hereto also agrees that any direct claim that
such Party may bring against any other Party hereto under the provisions of this
Agreement  shall be governed  exclusively  by the  provisions of this Article X,
other than Section 10.04(a).

     (c) Settlement of Claims.  The Indemnified Party may at any time notify the
Indemnifying  Party of its intention to settle or compromise any claim,  suit or
action  against the  Indemnified  Party without the consent of the  Indemnifying
Party;  provided,  however  that the  Indemnifying  Party  shall have no further
liability in respect thereof.

     (d) Subrogation.  The Indemnifying  Party shall be subrogated to any claims
or rights of the Indemnified  Party as against any other Persons with respect to
any amount paid by the Indemnifying  Party under this Article X. The Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying  Party, at the Indemnifying  Party's
expense,  in the assertion by the  Indemnifying  Party of any such claim against
such other Persons.

     SECTION 10.05. Limitations on Indemnification.

     (a)  Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) Circuit  City,  FNANB and Tyler Funding shall not be liable in the aggregate
for any amounts for which Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties are otherwise entitled
to  indemnification  pursuant to Section 10.02(iii) unless (x) a claim is timely
asserted during the survival period specified in Section  10.01(a),  and (y) the
aggregate  amount of all Damages  for which  Purchaser  Indemnified  Parties are
entitled  to  indemnification  pursuant  to  Section  10.02(iii)  exceeds,  on a
cumulative basis, $5 million (the "Deductible"),  and then only to the extent of
such  excess,  and (ii)  Circuit  City,  FNANB  and Tyler  Funding  shall not be
required to make indemnification  payments pursuant to Section 10.02(iii) to the
extent  indemnification  payments  thereunder would exceed in the aggregate $125
million (the "Cap").  The limitations  contained in this Section  10.05(a) shall
not apply in respect of the first sentence of Section 5.14.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) Purchaser  shall not be liable for any amounts for which Seller  Indemnified
Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification  pursuant to Section 10.03(ii)
unless (x) a claim is timely asserted  during the survival  period  specified in
Section  10.01(a) and (y) the  aggregate  amount of all Damages for which Seller
Indemnified  Parties  are  entitled  to  indemnification   pursuant  to  Section
10.03(ii) exceeds,  on a cumulative basis, the Deductible,  and then only to the
extent  of such  excess,  and  (ii)  Purchaser  shall  not be  required  to make
indemnification   payments   pursuant  to  Section   10.03(ii)   to  the  extent
indemnification payments thereunder would exceed in the aggregate the Cap.

                                       84

     (c) Other than with respect to a breach of Section 7.04, in determining the
foregoing   Deductible  and  in  otherwise   determining  the  amount  to  which
Indemnified Parties are entitled to assert a claim for indemnification  pursuant
this  Article  X,  no  claim  for  indirect,  incidental,   exemplary,  special,
consequential or punitive  damages,  lost profits or opportunity  costs shall be
taken into account.

     (d) Indemnity Payments shall be paid in immediately  available funds within
ten (10) Business  Days after the later of (i) the receipt of a written  request
from the party entitled to such  Indemnity  Payment and (ii) the date of payment
of the amount that is the subject of the Indemnity Payment by the party entitled
to  receive  the  Indemnity  Payment,  except  to the  extent  contested  by the
Indemnifying  Party. All such Indemnity Payments shall be made to the designated
account of, and in the manner  specified  in writing  by, the party  entitled to
such Indemnity Payments.

     (e) For  purposes  of  indemnification  under  this  Article X, a breach or
inaccuracy of a  representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement  contained in
this  Agreement,  shall be  deemed  to  occur  or exist if such  representation,
warranty,  covenant or agreement would have been so breached or inaccurate if it
had not  contained any  limitation or  qualification  as to  materiality  or the
Party's Knowledge;  provided,  however,  that Section 5.19 shall for purposes of
indemnification  under this Article X be qualified by  materiality  as set forth
therein.

     SECTION 10.06. Insurance; Tax Benefits.

     (a) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,  Damages shall be net
of any insurance or other recoveries  actually received by the Indemnified Party
or its  Affiliates  in  connection  with the facts  giving  rise to the right of
indemnification,  including any third-party  payments  actually  received by the
Indemnified  Party.  If  an  Indemnified  Party  shall  have  used  commercially
reasonable  best  efforts to recover any  amounts  recoverable  under  insurance
policies and shall not have recovered the applicable  Damages in full within one
hundred  twenty  (120) days,  the  Indemnifying  Party shall  promptly  pay upon
written request the amount with interest accrued thereon,  by which such Damages
exceeds the amounts actually recovered.

     (b) The  Indemnified  Party shall claim on the  appropriate  Tax Return any
Benefit  Item  arising  from  the  incurrence  or  payment  of  Damages  if  the
Indemnified Party believes such Benefit Item is allowable or if the Indemnifying
Party  provides  the  Indemnified  Party with a written  opinion of a nationally
recognized  law  firm or  accounting  firm  (which  firm  and  opinion  shall be
reasonably  acceptable to the Indemnified Party) to the effect that such Benefit
Item  "should" be  allowable.  Not more than ten (10) Business Days after filing
the Tax Return on which such  Benefit  Item is claimed,  the  Indemnified  Party
shall pay the Indemnifying  Party the amount of any realized Tax Benefit arising
from such Benefit Item (net of the Tax cost,  including the net present value of
any  reasonably  anticipated  future Tax cost, to the  Indemnified  Party or its
Affiliates arising from the receipt of the indemnification payment).

     SECTION 10.07.  Remedies Exclusive.  Except in cases of common law fraud or
as otherwise specifically provided herein, the remedies provided in Article VIII
or this Article X shall be the exclusive monetary remedies (including  equitable
remedies that involve  monetary  payment,  such as restitution or  disgorgement,
other than specific performance, to enforce any

                                       85

payment or  performance  due hereunder) of the parties hereto from and after the
Closing  in  connection  with any breach of a  representation  or  warranty,  or
non-performance,  partial  or total,  of any  covenant  or  agreement  contained
herein.

     SECTION 10.08.  Mitigation.  Each Indemnified  Party shall use commercially
reasonable  efforts to mitigate any claim or liability that an Indemnified Party
asserts or is reasonably  likely to assert under Article VIII or this Article X.
If an Indemnified Party shall fail to make such commercially  reasonable efforts
to mitigate any such claim or liability,  then notwithstanding  anything else to
the contrary contained herein,  none of Circuit City, FNANB,  Tyler Funding,  or
Purchaser  as the case may be, shall be required to  indemnify  any  Indemnified
Party for that portion of any Damages that could  reasonably be expected to have
been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made such efforts.

     SECTION  10.09.  Tax  Indemnification.  Except as  expressly as provided in
Article   VIII  or  this   Article  X,  this   Article  X  shall  not  apply  to
indemnification with respect to Taxes.

     SECTION  10.10.   Termination  of  Indemnification.   Except  as  otherwise
expressly  provided in this Article X, the  obligations  to  indemnify  and hold
harmless any Party pursuant to Sections 10.02 and 10.03 shall not terminate.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                   TERMINATION

     SECTION  11.01.  Termination.  This  Agreement  may be  terminated  and the
transactions  contemplated  hereby  may be  abandoned  at any time  prior to the
Closing Date only:

     (a) by the mutual written  consent of Circuit City,  FNANB,  Tyler Funding,
and Purchaser;

     (b) by either  Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding,  or  Purchaser  upon
notification of the  non-terminating  Parties by the  terminating  Party, if any
permanent  injunction  or  action by any  Governmental  Authority  of  competent
jurisdiction prohibiting  consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement  shall  have been  issued or taken and  shall  have  become  final and
nonappealable,  provided,  however,  that no  Party  shall  have  the  right  to
terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant to this  subsection  if such  injunction or
action  shall be due to the  failure  of the Party  seeking  to  terminate  this
Agreement to perform or observe the covenants  and  agreements of such Party set
forth herein;

     (c) by either  Circuit  City,  FNANB,  Tyler  Funding,  or Purchaser if the
Closing  shall  not  have  occurred  on  or  before   September  30,  2004  (the
"Termination  Date"),  except to the extent that such failure  arises out of, or
results from, a material breach by the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement
of any  representation,  warranty,  or covenant of such Party contained  herein;
provided,   however,   that  if  the  failure  to  consummate  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby by the Termination  Date is caused by a delay in satisfying
Section 9.01(a) or obtaining any approval of a Governmental  Authority necessary
to satisfy  Section  9.01(b),  no Party shall have the right to  terminate  this
Agreement  pursuant to this Section 11.01(c) until the date that is three months
after the Termination Date;

                                       86

     (d) by Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding (i) if Purchaser  shall have
breached   or  failed  to  perform   in  any   material   respect   any  of  its
representations,  warranties,  covenants,  or other agreements contained in this
Agreement,  which  breach or failure to perform  would  render any  condition to
Circuit City's,  FNANB's or Tyler Funding's  obligations  under Sections 9.01 or
9.03 incapable of being  satisfied;  provided,  however,  that if such breach or
failure to perform is curable by Purchaser  through the exercise of commercially
reasonable  efforts,  and for so long as such Party  continues to exercise  such
commercially  reasonable  efforts,  none of Circuit City, FNANB or Tyler Funding
may terminate this Agreement  under this Section  11.01(d);  provided,  further,
that the  preceding  proviso  shall not in any  event be  deemed  to extend  the
Termination  Date, or (ii) if a condition  under Section 9.01 or Section 9.03 to
Circuit  City's,  FNANB's  or Tyler  Funding's  obligations  hereunder  has been
rendered incapable of being satisfied;  provided,  however,  that no Party shall
have the right to  terminate  this  Agreement if such Party is then in breach of
any material representation or warranty contained herein or is in default in any
material  respect in the  observance or in the timely  performance of any of its
covenants or agreements contained herein; or

     (e) by Purchaser,  (i) if Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler Funding shall have
breached   or  failed  to  perform   in  any   material   respect   any  of  its
representations,  warranties,  covenants,  or other agreements contained in this
Agreement,  which  breach or failure to perform  would  render any  condition to
Purchaser's   obligations  under  Sections  9.01  or  9.02  incapable  of  being
satisfied;  provided,  however,  that if such  breach or  failure  to perform is
curable  by  Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding  through  the  exercise  of
commercially  reasonable  efforts,  and for so long as such Party  continues  to
exercise such commercially reasonable efforts,  Purchaser may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section  11.01(e);  provided,  further,  that the preceding
proviso shall not in any event be deemed to extend the Termination Date, or (ii)
if a condition  under  Section 9.01 or Section 9.02 to  Purchaser's  obligations
hereunder has been rendered incapable of being satisfied; and provided, further,
that no Party shall have the right to terminate  this Agreement if such Party is
then in breach of any material representation or warranty contained herein or is
in  default  in  any  material  respect  in  the  observance  or in  the  timely
performance of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein.

     (f) by  Purchaser,  if:  Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler Funding is adjudged
bankrupt or insolvent  by a  Governmental  Authority of competent  jurisdiction;
insolvency  proceedings  are  instituted  against  Circuit City,  FNANB or Tyler
Funding; a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction appoints a receiver,
liquidator,  conservator or trustee for Circuit City,  FNANB or Tyler Funding or
all or substantially all of their assets, or approves any petition filed against
Circuit City, FNANB or Tyler Funding seeking their reorganization.

     (g) by Circuit  City,  FNANB or Tyler  Funding,  if:  Purchaser is adjudged
bankrupt or insolvent  by a  Governmental  Authority of competent  jurisdiction;
insolvency   proceedings  are  instituted  against  Purchaser;   a  Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction appoints a receiver, liquidator, conservator
or trustee for Purchaser or all or substantially  all of its assets, or approves
any petition filed against Purchaser seeking its reorganization.

     SECTION 11.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to this Article XI, all further  obligations  of the Parties (and their
respective  Affiliates,  directors,  officers,  representatives or agents) under
this Agreement (other than obligations

                                       87

contained  in  Sections  7.04,  7.06  and  12.06,  all of  which  shall  survive
termination)  shall be terminated without any further Liability or obligation on
the part of any Party to the other,  provided that nothing  herein shall relieve
any Party from Liability for any knowing,  willful, or fraudulent breach of this
Agreement prior to termination.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

contained  herein,  this  Agreement  may not be  assigned  by any of the Parties

Article X.

Agreement  will inure to the benefit of and be binding  upon the Parties  hereto

Agreement,  express or implied,  shall  confer any rights,  benefits,  claims or
remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective  successors
and permitted assigns; provided,  however, that the provisions of Article X will
inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.

     SECTION 12.04. Entire Agreement. This Agreement,  together with the Related
Agreements and all Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, which constitute a
part of and are  incorporated  into this  Agreement and the Related  Agreements,
constitutes  the entire  agreement  among the Parties and  supersedes  any other
agreement  (including the Confidentiality  Agreement),  whether written or oral,
that may have been made or entered into by any of the Parties (or by any officer
or officers of any of such Parties) relating to the matters contemplated hereby.
The  Parties  intend that this  Agreement  shall  constitute  the  complete  and
exclusive  statement of its terms and that no extrinsic evidence  whatsoever may
be introduced in any judicial proceeding involving this Agreement.

     SECTION  12.05.  Amendments  and Waivers.  This  Agreement  may be amended,
modified,  superseded,  or  canceled,  and  any of the  terms,  representations,
warranties  or  covenants  hereof  may be  waived,  only by  written  instrument
executed  by each of the  parties  or,  in the case of a  waiver,  by the  Party
waiving compliance. In the course of the planning and

                                       89

coordination of this Agreement,  written  documents have been exchanged  between
the parties.  Such written  documents shall not be deemed to amend or supplement
this  Agreement.  The  failure  of any  party at any  time or  times to  require
performance  of any  provision  hereof shall in no manner  affect the right at a
later time to enforce the same.  No waiver by any party of any  condition  or of
any  breach  of any  term,  representation,  warranty  or  covenant  under  this
Agreement,  whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or  construed  as a further  or  continuing  waiver of any other
condition  or of any  breach  of any such  condition  of breach or waiver of any
other condition or of any breach of any other term, representation,  warranty or
covenant under this Agreement.

     SECTION 12.06.  Expenses.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
will each bear their own legal,  accounting  and other costs in connection  with
the transactions  contemplated hereby, including taxes, if any, that are imposed
upon a  Party  attributable  to its  activities  hereunder  whether  or not  the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

     SECTION 12.07. No Joint Venture.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to create a partnership or joint venture between  Sellers and Purchaser.  Except
as expressly  set forth herein,  no Party shall have any authority  hereunder to
bind or commit the other Party.

     SECTION  12.08.  Governing  Law.  THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL  BE  CONSTRUED  IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH THE LAWS OF THE  STATE OF NEW  YORK  WITHOUT  REFERENCE  TO ITS
CONFLICTS  OF  LAW  PROVISIONS   (OTHER  THAN  SECTION  5-1401  OF  THE  GENERAL
OBLIGATIONS  LAW),  AND THE  OBLIGATIONS,  RIGHTS AND  REMEDIES  OF THE  PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

     SECTION 12.09. Jurisdiction; Venue; Consent to Service of Process.

     (a) Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally  submits,  for itself
and its property,  to the  jurisdiction  of the state courts of the State of New
York located in the City of New York,  or any federal  court sitting in the City
of New York in New York County and any appellate  court from any such court,  in
any suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Related  Agreements,  or for  recognition  or  enforcement  of any  judgment
resulting  from any such  suit,  action or  proceeding,  and each  Party  hereby
irrevocably  and  unconditionally  agrees that all claims in respect of any such
suit, action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any court in the State
of New York located in the City of New York or, to the extent  permitted by law,
by removal or otherwise,  in such federal court.  The Parties  further agree, to
the extent permitted by law, that final and  nonappealable  judgment against any
of them in any action or proceeding  contemplated  above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by
suit on the judgment,  a certified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of
the fact and amount of such judgment.

     (b) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter  may acquire any immunity
from  jurisdiction  of any  court or from any  legal  process  (whether  through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution or  otherwise)  with respect to itself or its  property,  each of such
Parties hereby  irrevocably  waives such immunity in respect of its  obligations
with respect to this Agreement.

                                       90

     (c) It shall be a condition  precedent to each  Party's  right to bring any
suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement  that
such suit,  action or proceeding,  in the first instance,  be brought in a state
court  located  in the State of New York  located in the City of New York or, to
the extent  permitted by law, by removal or  otherwise,  in such  federal  court
(unless such suit, action or proceeding is brought solely to obtain discovery or
to enforce a judgment), and if each of the state courts in the State of New York
located  in the City of New  York  and such  federal  court  refuses  to  accept
jurisdiction  with  respect  thereto,  such suit,  action or  proceeding  may be
brought in any other court with jurisdiction.

     (d) No Party may move to (i) transfer any such suit,  action or  proceeding
from a state  court in the State of New York  located in the City of New York or
such federal  court to another  jurisdiction,  (ii)  consolidate  any such suit,
action or  proceeding  brought in a state court in the State of New York located
in the City of New York or such federal court with a suit,  action or proceeding
in another  jurisdiction  or (iii)  dismiss any such suit,  action or proceeding
brought  in a state  court in the State of New York  located  in the City of New
York or such  federal  court for the  purpose  of  bringing  the same in another
jurisdiction.

     (e) Each  Party  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally  waives,  to the
fullest  extent it may legally and  effectively do so, (i) any objection that it
may now or  hereafter  have to the  laying  of  venue  of any  suit,  action  or
proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement in a state court in the
State of New York located in the City of New York or any federal  court  sitting
in the  City of New  York,  (ii) the  defense  of an  inconvenient  forum to the
maintenance  of such suit,  action or proceeding in any such court and (iii) the
right to object,  with  respect to such suit,  action or  proceeding,  that such
court does not have jurisdiction over such Party.

     (f) Each  Party  irrevocably  consents  to service of process in the manner
provided for the giving of notices  pursuant to Section  12.01.  Nothing in this
Section  12.09 shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law.

     SECTION 12.10. Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief. The parties
hereby  expressly  recognize  and  acknowledge  that  immediate,  extensive  and
irreparable  damage  would  result,  no  adequate  remedy at law would exist and
damages  would be difficult to determine if any  provision of this  Agreement is
not performed in accordance  with its specific terms or otherwise  breached.  In
addition  to,  and not in  limitation  of,  any other  remedy  available  to the
Parties,  an  aggrieved  Party  under this  Agreement  would be entitled to seek
specific  performance  of the terms  hereof  and  immediate  injunctive  relief,
without the  necessity of proving the  inadequacy  of money damages as a remedy.
Such  remedies and any and all other  remedies  provided  for in this  Agreement
shall be  cumulative in nature and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any
other remedies whatsoever that any Party may otherwise have.

     SECTION 12.11.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY
LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, SUIT,  PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

                                       91

     SECTION 12.12. Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement or portion
thereof is held invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable by reason of any rule of
law, administrative or judicial provision or public policy, such provision shall
be ineffective only to the extent invalid,  illegal, void or unenforceable,  and
the remainder of such provision and all other provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless  remain in full  force  and  effect.  To the  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law, the parties waive any  provision  that renders any provision of
this Agreement  invalid,  illegal,  void or  unenforceable  in any respect.  The
parties  shall,  to the extent lawful and  practicable,  use their  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  enter  into  arrangements  to  reinstate  the  intended
benefits,  net of the intended  burdens,  of any such  provision  held  invalid,
illegal, void, or unenforceable.

     SECTION  12.13.  Headings.  The headings in this Agreement are inserted for
convenience  of reference  only and shall not be  considered a part of or affect
the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

     SECTION 12.14. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts,  each of which  shall be an  original,  but all of which  together
shall  constitute  one and the same  instrument,  and such  counterparts  may be
delivered by facsimile transmission.

                            [SIGNATURE PAGE FOLLOWS]
