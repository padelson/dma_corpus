4 _ARTICLE III_

 

CONSIDERATION

3.1 _Deposit and Base Purchase Price_. The base purchase price for the
Transferred Assets shall be Two Hundred Thirty Million Dollars ($230,000,000)
(as may be adjusted as a result of  _Section 3.5_, the " _Base Purchase
Price_ "). Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall deposit with Seller Twenty-Three Million Dollars ($23,000,000)
(hereinafter called the " _Deposit_ "). The Deposit shall be retained by
Seller if (x) the Initial Closing occurs or (y) the Initial Closing does not
occur solely because this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
10.1(b)_. The Parties acknowledge that Seller would retain the Deposit in the
case of (y) as liquidated damages due to the difficulty and inconvenience of
ascertaining and measuring actual damages that may be caused by such a failure
to close. Otherwise, if the Initial Closing does not occur and this Agreement
is terminated under _Section 10.1(c)_ or _Section 10.1(d)_, the Deposit
shall be refunded promptly to Purchaser. If the Initial Closing does not occur
and this Agreement is terminated under _Section 10.1(a)_, the final
disposition of the Deposit will be mutually agreed to by Seller and Purchaser.
At the Initial Closing (as defined below), Seller shall apply the Deposit to
the Base Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers retention of the Deposit upon Purchasers forfeiture
thereof shall be Sellers sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims
under this Agreement. The Deposit shall be made in immediately available
funds by wire-transfer to:

3.2 _Balance of Base Purchase Price_. On the Initial Closing Date (as defined

Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the bank account(s)
designated by Seller.

3.3  _Additional Consideration_. As additional consideration for the
Transferred Assets, Purchaser shall also:

 

(a) on the Initial Closing Date and any Supplemental Closing Date, as
applicable, pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the value, determined
from the previous five day closing average price of three distributors of
marine fuel in the Gulf Coast, of the aggregate Vessel Fuel Inventories owned
by Seller and/or its Affiliates on-board the Vessels (or the
tendered Unavailable Vessels with respect to a Supplemental Closing) that has
not been reimbursed to Seller and/or its Affiliates or is not subject to
reimbursement to Seller and/or by its Affiliates by a charterer as of the day
before such Closing Date, such amount to be paid in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to the bank account(s) designated by Seller (" _Vessel
Fuel Inventories Additional Purchase Price_ ");

 



5 (b) on the Initial Closing Date and any Supplemental Closing Date,
as applicable, pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the amount of all
payments made by Seller prior to such Closing Date and set forth on _Schedule
1.1(c)_ in respect of Purchase Orders associated with the Vessels (or the
tendered Unavailable Vessels with respect to Supplemental Closings) that are
Assumed Contracts (" _Purchase Order Additional Purchase Price_ "); and

(c) on the Initial Closing Date and any Supplemental Closing Date, as
applicable, pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to, without duplication of
any amounts paid pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_, the amount of all cash
payments made by Seller on or prior to any applicable Closing in respect of
Reimbursable Items (" _Reimbursable Items Additional Purchase Price_ ").

Purchasers representatives shall be given reasonable advance notice of, and
shall be permitted to attend and observe, the measurement of the Vessel Fuel
Inventories and to have reasonable access to documentation of inventory
positions maintained by Seller.

3.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Transferred Assets as set forth on _Annex II_.

3.5 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. If, as of the Initial Closing Date,
either (i) there has occurred an actual or constructive total loss of any
Vessel (as determined by an independent marine surveyor acceptable to Seller
and Purchaser) or (ii) there has occurred a Qualified Loss requiring
expenditures of greater than $500,000 to remedy such Qualified Loss so as to
bring such Vessel up to the condition that it was in on the applicable Survey
Date (each such Vessel referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) as an "
_Unavailable Vessel_ "), then (A) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
relevant purchase price of such Unavailable Vessel set forth in _Annex II_ for
such Unavailable Vessel (for each such Unavailable Vessel, the " _Unavailable
Vessel Purchase Price_ "), (B) such Unavailable Vessel and Unavailable Vessel
Related Assets shall not constitute part of the Transferred Assets to be
transferred by Seller to Purchaser on the Initial Closing Date, (C) such
Unavailable Vessel and Unavailable Vessel Related Assets shall (initially,
solely in the case of clause (ii)) constitute an Excluded Asset, (D) the Time
Charters and Purchase Orders directly associated with such Unavailable Vessel
shall (initially, solely in the case of clause (ii)) not constitute part of
the Assumed Contracts (the " _Unavailable Vessel Assumed Contracts_ ") and (E)
the Customer Proposals directly associated with such Unavailable Vessel shall
(initially, solely in the case of clause (ii)) not constitute part of the
Assumed Liabilities (the " _Unavailable Vessel Customer Proposals_ " and
together with the Unavailable Vessel Assumed Contracts, the " _Unavailable
Vessel Assumed Liabilities_ "). A Vessel shall not be deemed to be an
Unavailable Vessel because it is in drydock or being recertified.
Additionally, solely in the case of clause (ii) above, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to repair the Unavailable Vessel to the
condition it was in an as of the applicable Survey Date (with the cost of such
repairs to be allocated pursuant to the last two sentences of this  _Section
3.5_) and tender such Unavailable Vessel and its associated Unavailable Vessel
Related Assets to Purchaser as soon as practicable

 



6  (but in any event within 180 days after the Initial Closing Date) and, upon
completion of such repairs and proper tender of such Unavailable Vessel and
its associated Unavailable Vessel Related Assets (collectively, " _Repaired
Unavailable Vessel and Related Assets_ ") under this Agreement, Purchaser
shall purchase such Repaired Unavailable Vessel and Related Assets, for cash,
at the Unavailable Vessel Purchase Price, and assume the related Unavailable
Vessel Assumed Liabilities, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and the Purchase Price shall be deemed increased by the Unavailable
Vessel Purchase Price thereafter. Upon Sellers written notice that it is
prepared to tender delivery of Repaired Unavailable Vessel and Related Assets
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Parties shall conduct a Supplemental
Closing pursuant to _Section 4.4_. With respect to any Qualified Loss (a)
repaired by Seller or its Affiliates prior to a Supplemental Closing to bring
an Unavailable Vessel up to the condition that it was in on the applicable
Survey Date or (b) suffered by a Vessel prior to the Initial Closing
that does not constitute an Unavailable Vessel whether or not so repaired by
Seller or its Affiliates, (x) Purchaser shall be responsible to pay the first
$500,000 covered by clause (ii) above of all repair, restoration or corrective
costs attributed to such Qualified Losses per each Vessel to bring such
Vessel up to the condition it was in on the applicable Survey Date
(collectively, " _Repair Costs_ "); _provided that_ , in no event shall
Purchaser be responsible for more than $2,500,000 of such Repair Costs in the
aggregate and (y) Seller shall be responsible for the balance of such costs.
As applicable, promptly after the Repair Costs are finalized, the Parties
shall reimburse each other for such documented Repair Costs pursuant to the
allocation set forth in this _Section 3.5_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for the purposes hereof, to the extent an Unavailable Vessel is a tank barge,
the associated tug will also be treated as an Unavailable Vessel until such
time as a Supplemental Closing occurs with respect to such tank barge.

3.6  _Transfer Taxes and Fees_. All applicable sales Taxes, transfer Taxes,
recording or transfer fees, costs or premiums for or related to, and other
similar costs due and payable in connection with, the transfer of the
Transferred Assets to Purchaser shall be paid by Purchaser. Seller agrees to
cooperate with Purchaser and give reasonable assistance to assist Purchaser in
minimizing any such Taxes, fees, costs and premiums to the extent legally
possible. Any taxes on income or gain arising from the sale of the
Transferred Assets shall be borne by Seller.

3.7 _Ad Valorem Taxes_. Ad valorem Taxes relating to the Transferred Assets
for any ad valorem Tax period in which the Closing Date (or Supplemental
Closing, as applicable) falls shall be prorated based on the number of days of
ownership by the Parties before and after the Closing Date (or Supplemental
Closing, as applicable), as the case may be, regardless of which Party
receives a tax statement from any taxing authority. The Party named on the
relevant ad valorem Tax notice, assessment or invoice shall pay the amount
due, provide the other Party copies of the relevant supporting data and
request reimbursement of the other Partys portion of the ad valorem Tax paid.
The Parties agree to make appropriate reimbursements in respect of such ad
valorem Taxes.

 

3.8 _Alternative Transaction Structures_. Purchaser shall have the right to
propose alternative structures for the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements in order to structure such transactions
in a more Tax-efficient manner. Seller agrees to accept and cooperate in
implementing any such alternative structures as long as such structures
do not have adverse consequences for Seller and do not materially delay or
increase the costs associated with the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

preceding six years), that is, or has been, (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA
or Section 412 of the Code, or (ii) a "multiemployer plan," within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. All premiums and contributions
required to be paid or made by HOO and its Affiliates under the Employee Plans
will have been properly paid, made or accrued on or prior to the Closing.

all obligations of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

12.4 _Amendment and Waiver_.

(a) No failure or delay on the part of Seller or Purchaser in exercising any

any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy preclude any

or remedy.

(b) Any amendment, supplement or modification of or to any provision of this
Agreement, any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and any consent to
any departure by Seller or Purchaser from the terms of any provision of this
Agreement, shall be effective (i) only if it is made or given in writing and
signed by the Parties, in the case of an amendment, supplement or
modification, and by the Party granting the waiver or consent in the case of a
waiver or consent, and (ii) only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which made or given.

12.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

12.6 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

 

12.7 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL MARITIME LAW OF THE
UNITED STATES TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE AND OTHERWISE BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE
OF LOUISIANA WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW THEREOF.

12.8 _Severability_. If any one or more of the provisions contained herein, or
the application thereof in any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the

34 12.9 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state,
local, or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires
otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without limitation. All
personal pronouns used in this Agreement, whether used in the masculine,
feminine or neuter gender, shall include all other genders; the singular
shall include the plural, and vice versa. All references herein to Exhibits,
Schedules, Articles, Sections or subdivisions thereof shall refer to the
corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Article, Section or subdivision thereof of
this Agreement unless specific reference is made to such exhibits, articles,
sections or subdivisions of another document or instrument. The terms
"herein," "hereby," "hereunder," "hereof," "hereinafter," and other
equivalent words refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not solely to the
particular portion of the Agreement in which such word is used. The words
"shall" and "will" are used interchangeably throughout this Agreement and

respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein. There are no
restrictions, promises, representations, warranties or undertakings, other
than those set forth or referred to herein or therein. This Agreement,
together with the Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and the other
Transaction Documents supersede all prior agreements and understandings
between the Parties with respect to such subject matter, whether verbal or
written. Upon the Initial Closing, Seller hereby releases, and causes or
shall cause HOS to hereby release, GEL from all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement except with respect to its confidentiality
obligations thereunder relating to any Transferred Assets and Assumed
Obligations that are not transferred and assumed at the Initial Closing. Upon
any Supplemental Closing, Seller hereby releases, and causes or shall cause
HOS to hereby release, GEL from all of its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the Transferred Assets and
Assumed Liabilities transferred and assumed at such Supplemental Closing.

 



35 12.11 _Further Assurances_. The Parties shall execute such documents and
perform such further acts (including, without limitation, obtaining any
consents, exemptions, authorizations or other actions by, or giving any
notices to, or making any filings with, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person) as may be reasonably required or desirable to carry out or to
perform the intent of this Agreement.

12.12 _Disclosure_. Any matter set forth in any section of the Schedules
shall be deemed set forth in all other sections of the Schedules to the extent
it is reasonably apparent that such matter is responsive to such other
sections of the Schedules whether or not a specific cross-reference appears.
The inclusion of any information (including dollar amounts) in any section of
the Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by
Seller that such information is required to be listed in such section or is
material to or outside the Ordinary Course of Business of Seller, nor shall
such information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality (and the
actual standard of materiality may be higher or lower than the matters
disclosed by such information). In addition, matters reflected in the
Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to
be reflected in the Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. The information contained in this Agreement, together with the
Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules hereto, is disclosed solely for purposes of
this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein shall
be deemed to be an admission by either Party hereto to any third party of any
matter whatsoever (including any violation of applicable law or breach of
contract).

12.13 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, not make disclosure of
any Confidential Information to any Person other than (i) to its owners,
directors, officers, employees, consultants or other representatives to whom
such disclosure is necessary or reasonably convenient for the completion of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) as required to convey
title to any of the Transferred Assets; (iii) as required by Law or any
securities exchange or market rule; (iv) as may be requested or required by
any Governmental Authority (provided that Seller first notifies Purchaser and
gives Purchaser the opportunity to contest such request or requirement), (v)
to the extent that the Confidential Information is or becomes generally
available to the public through no fault of Seller or its Affiliates making
such disclosure, (vi) to the extent that the same information is in the
possession (on a non-confidential basis) of Seller making such disclosure
prior to receipt of such Confidential Information, (vii) to the extent that
Seller independently develops the Confidential Information without in any way
relying on any Confidential Information, (viii) to the extent that the same
information becomes available to Seller on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than Purchaser, Seller or the Affiliates of either of them, which
source, to Sellers Knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation to Purchaser, or
(ix) with prior notice of request for disclosure to, and consent of, Purchaser
(which consent may be withheld in Purchasers sole discretion).

 



36 (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, treat and hold as
such all of the Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. If Seller
is ever requested or required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any action) to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller
will notify Purchaser promptly of the request or requirement so that Purchaser
may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with this
_Section 12.13_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of
a waiver hereunder, Seller, on the written advice of counsel, is compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any Government Authority, arbitrator,
or mediator or else stand liable for contempt, Seller may disclose the
Confidential Information to the Government Authority, arbitrator, or mediator;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, at the request of Purchaser, an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Purchaser may designate.

12.14 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Parties would be damaged irreparably if any provision of this Agreement
is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise
breached. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 12.7_
and _Section 12.15_, each Party agrees that the other Parties will be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
its terms and provisions in any action instituted in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and
the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at
law or in equity.

12.15 _Indemnification; Remedies; Limitation of Damages_.

Sellers representations or warranties (without giving effect to any

Adverse Effect or concepts of similar import, or any qualification or
limitation as to monetary value) contained herein (other than an inaccuracy,
violation or breach of a representation or warranty constituting a Special
Representation or a Seller Fundamental Representation), (y) the applicable
survival period pursuant to _Section 12.15(a)_ has not expired and (z) the
Purchaser Indemnitees make a written claim for indemnification against Seller

the Closing Seller agrees to release, indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnitees from and against any Adverse Consequences suffered by
the Purchaser Indemnitees to the extent relating to or arising from such
inaccuracy, violation or breach;  _provided that_ Seller shall not have any

inaccuracies, violations and breaches in excess of the General Deductible
Amount reduced (but not below zero) by all inaccuracies, violations and
breaches covered by _Section 12.15(b)(ii)_ for which Seller has not

portion of the Special Deductible Amount.

 

(iii) In the event of: (x) (1) any breach of Sellers covenants or obligations

38  concepts of similar import), (y) the applicable survival period pursuant to
_Section 12.15(a)_ has not expired and (z) the Purchaser Indemnitees make a
written claim for indemnification against Seller pursuant to _Section 12.2_
within such survival period, then from and after the Closing, Seller agrees to

limited to a claim for actual monetary damages. However, any Transaction Claim
asserted by a party hereto must be delivered in writing, detailing with
specificity the circumstances of the alleged breach and/or damages and

punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including
business interruption, diminution in value, loss of future revenue, profits
or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity;

(f) The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the subject matter of this Agreement exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement; and
the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled
to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. Nevertheless, the
forgoing shall not be deemed to limit the duties owed or the remedies
available to the Parties under the Ancillary Agreements, which shall be
deemed to be separate and apart from those of this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that all representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement and the certificates incorporated herein are contractual in
nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth herein.
No Party is asserting the truth of any representation and warranty set forth
in this Agreement; rather the Parties have agreed that should any
representations and warranties of any Party prove untrue, the other Party
shall have the specific rights and remedies herein specified as the exclusive
remedy therefor, but that no other rights, remedies or causes of action
(whether in law or in equity or whether in contract or in tort) are permitted
to any Party as a result of the untruth of any such representation and
warranty. Furthermore, the Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement
embodies the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived
from arms length negotiations; both Parties specifically acknowledge that
neither Party has any special relationship with the other Party that would
justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arms length transaction. The sole and exclusive remedies for
any Transaction Claim shall be those remedies available for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies may be further limited or excluded pursuant
to the express terms of this Agreement); and the Parties hereby waive and
release any and all tort claims and causes of action that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any tort claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this
Agreement);

 

(g) No Partys rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement will be deemed
waived by such Partys consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each such right and remedy will be effective regardless of any
inspection or investigation conducted, or the awareness of any matters
acquired (or capable or reasonably capable of being acquired), by or on
behalf of such Party or by its directors, officers, employees, or
representatives or at any time (regardless of whether notice of such awareness
has been given the other Party), whether before or after the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date with respect to any circumstances
constituting a condition under this Agreement, unless any waiver specifically
so states.

(h) _Section 12.15(a)_, _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ and _(f)_ shall be effective
only on and after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, this Agreement shall not limit the rights or remedies of either
Parties to the extent relating to claims of

 



41  intentional fraud. Nevertheless, the Parties agree and acknowledge that,
except for intentional fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any and all monetary damages of the Seller Indemnitees and the Purchaser
Indemnitees arising under, out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby (whether based on contract, tort, strict
liability, other laws or otherwise), shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Section 12.15_ only, and, subject to the
proviso of this sentence set forth below, no Person will have any other
entitlement, remedy or recourse; and each party hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted pursuant to all
Requirements of Law, any and all other rights and remedies that may arise
under any applicable Requirements of Law (except those arising out of
intentional fraud) that any Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee may
have against any Party arising under or based upon any Requirements of Law or
otherwise relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not be interpreted to limit any partys remedy for specific performance
which may be sought under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
reserves all rights, remedies and defenses available to it after the Closing
under common law, civil law, and state, federal and maritime law related to
the Retained Liabilities and the Assumed Liabilities.

12.16 _Liability of Parties and Non-Parties_. Subject to all the limitations
set forth in _Section 12.15_, this Agreement may only be enforced against the
Parties, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort)
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto; and no Affiliate,
officer, director, shareholder, member, manager, employee, representative
or affiliate of any Party (including any person negotiating or executing this
Agreement on behalf of a Party) shall have any liability or obligation with
respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including a representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement). Neither GELs
general partner nor any other owner of Equity Interests in GEL shall be liable
for the obligations of GEL under this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents including, in each case, by reason of any
payment obligation imposed by governing state partnership statutes.
