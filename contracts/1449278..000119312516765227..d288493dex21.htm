Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

 _R ECITALS _

 

WHEREAS, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as
it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_ _Offer__ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _ _Share__ " and, collectively, the " _ _Shares__ "), other
than the Excluded Shares, at a price per Share equal to $14.00 (such amount,
or any other amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement,
subject to any adjustment contemplated by Section 2.2(c), the " _ _Offer
Price__ "), net to the seller in cash, without interest and subject to any
required Tax withholding, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer,
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _ _Merger__ "),
with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ "), and each issued
and outstanding Share, other than any Excluded Share or Appraisal Share, that
is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled
and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price, without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ")
has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement,
including the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, are fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) electing that
this Agreement and the Transactions be expressly governed by Section 251(h)
of the DGCL, (iii) adopting and approving this Agreement, declaring the
advisability of this Agreement and approving the Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (iv)
approving the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, and (v) recommending that the holders of Company Common Stock
accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (such
recommendation, the " _ _Company Board Recommendation__ "), in each case, on
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have adopted
and approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger
Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein; WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall,
subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be
consummated as soon as practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are executing
and delivering Tender and Support Agreements in favor of Parent and Merger
Sub, pursuant to which those stockholders, among other things, will agree to
tender all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
them to Merger Sub in the Offer.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

SECTION 1.1. _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Article 8, as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of
the outstanding Shares, other than the Excluded Shares, at a price per Share
equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest and
subject to any required Tax withholding; _provided, however,_ that Merger Sub
shall not be required to commence the Offer if (i) the Company shall not be
prepared to file immediately with the SEC, and to disseminate to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9, and (ii) any of the Offer
Conditions set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) on _Exhibit B_ are not then
satisfied (but only to the extent, in the case of the Offer Condition set
forth in clause (d) on _Exhibit B_ , the covenants are required to be
performed at or prior to the commencement of the Offer).

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the satisfaction of
the Minimum Tender Condition and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Exhibit B_ (the Minimum Tender Condition and the other
conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ are referred to collectively as the " _
_Offer Conditions__ "). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to
purchase that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum
Tender Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Merger Sub expressly reserves
the right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition or
(iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall (A) reduce the Offer Price, (B) change or

 



-2-  waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (C) impose conditions or requirements to
the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (D) extend or otherwise change
the Expiration Date in a manner other than as required or permitted by this
Agreement, (E) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (F)
decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, or
(G) otherwise amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or the other terms
of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects any holder of Shares in its
capacity as such. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to its scheduled
expiration (as such expiration may be extended or re-extended in accordance
with this Agreement), unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 8.1

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The initial expiration date of
the Offer shall be one minute following 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time on the date
that is twenty business days following the commencement of the Offer,
determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the
Exchange Act, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company
(such date or subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _ _Expiration Date__
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to the parties respective termination rights under Section 8, Merger
Sub: (x) shall extend the Offer from time to time: (1) for any period
required by any Law or any interpretation or position of the SEC applicable to
the Offer; (2) for periods the length of which shall be specified by Merger
Sub or Parent (not to exceed ten Business Days per extension) until any
waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of
the Offer under the HSR Act will have expired or been terminated; and (3) at
the request of the Company, if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub,
for periods the length of which shall be specified by Merger Sub or Parent
(not to exceed ten Business Days per extension) to permit such Offer Condition
to be satisfied and (y) may extend the Offer from time to time, in its
discretion (and without the consent of the Company or any other Person), if,
as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived by Parent or Merger Sub, for periods the length of which
shall be specified by Merger Sub or Parent (not to exceed ten Business Days
per extension) to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; _provided,
however,_ that in no event shall Merger Sub be required or permitted (without
the prior written consent of the Company) to extend the Offer to a date later
than the Outside Date.

(d) _Termination of the Offer_. Except in connection with a valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, and subject to its obligations to
extend the Offer in accordance with Section 1.1(c), Merger Sub shall not
terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8, Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

 



-3- (e) _Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent and Merger Sub shall:
(i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _ _Schedule TO__ "), which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement, notice of
guaranteed delivery and other ancillary offer documents pursuant to which the
Offer shall be made (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein
pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _ _Offer Documents__ ") and (ii) take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities
laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents (i) to comply in
all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable U.S. federal
securities laws and (ii) on the date first filed with the SEC and on the date
first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares, not to contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the Company in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or on
its behalf specifically for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the other Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to
amend or supplement the Schedule TO and, as applicable, the other Offer
Documents and to cause the Schedule TO as so amended and supplemented to be
filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented
to be disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Laws. Unless the Company Board shall have
effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company and its counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer
Documents and any amendments thereto prior to filing such documents with the
SEC or dissemination of such documents to the holders of Shares. Unless the
Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Change Recommendation,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of
any written comments or telephonic notification of any oral comments that
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments (and shall give the Company prompt telephonic notice of any material
discussions with the SEC staff), shall consult with the Company and its
counsel prior to responding to such comments, and shall provide to the
Company and its counsel a copy of any written responses thereto of Parent or
Merger Sub or their counsel and telephonic notice of any oral responses or
discussions with the SEC staff. Unless the Company Board shall have effected
a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, the Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company, any Company
Subsidiary and the Companys stockholders that may be required or reasonably
requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).

(f)  _Funds_. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer (other than Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee) that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer. Parent and Merger
Sub shall, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that all of their
respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the Offer.

 



-4- SECTION 1.2. _Company Actions_.

 

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _
_Transactions__ ").

(b) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, to the extent required by
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _ _Schedule 14D-9__ ") that shall contain (i) the
Company Board Recommendation (subject to Section 6.1(b)), and the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board
Recommendation (unless the Company Board shall have previously effected a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation); (ii) the opinion of the financial
advisor referred to in Section 3.20; (iii) a fair summary of the financial
analysis conducted by such financial advisor in accordance with applicable
Law; and (iv) the notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (i) to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and (ii) on
the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or
given to the holders of Shares, not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that no covenant
is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on behalf
of Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information will have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments and supplements
thereto prior to filing such documents with the SEC or dissemination of such
documents to the holders of Shares. The Company shall provide Parent and
Merger Sub and its counsel with a copy of any written comments or telephonic
notification of any oral comments that the Company or its counsel may receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments (and shall give Parent prompt telephonic notice
of any material discussions with the SEC staff), shall consult with Parent and
Merger Sub and their counsel prior to responding to such comments, and shall
provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel a copy of any
written responses thereto and telephonic notice of any oral responses or
discussions with the SEC staff. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations
of the Company in the preceding two sentences of this Section 1.2(b) shall not
apply from and after the time the Company Board effects a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.4.

 



-5- (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to) furnish Merger Sub or its designated agent promptly with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
Company Common Stock as of a recent date, together with copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial

furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as
Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the
holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except
for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any
other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger
Sub shall, until the consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the

Business Day on which Section 7.1 is satisfied or waived, at the offices of
DLA Piper LLP (US), 2000 University Avenue, East Palo Alto, California 94303,

accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL and (b) take all other necessary
or appropriate actions to cause the Merger to be effected under Section

ARTICLE 2

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

SECTION 2.1. _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each
share of Merger Sub capital stock shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.2. _Conversion of Company Common Stock_ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(c), each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded Shares or Appraisal
Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right
to receive the Offer Price in cash without interest thereon (the " _ _Merger
Consideration__ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Laws. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares will no longer be outstanding
and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder
of a Share will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the Certificate or
uncertificated Shares (the _"_ _ _Uncertificated Shares__ _"_ ) in accordance
with Section 2.3, without interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution will be made with respect
thereto (such canceled shares, the " _ _Excluded Shares__ ").

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, divisions, or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then all calculations provided
for that are based on a number of shares of any class or series (or trading
prices therefor) affected thereby, including the Offer Price and Merger
Consideration, will be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



-7- SECTION 2.3. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter
into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), which
will provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this Section 2.3. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent
as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Non-
Employee Equity Awards, for payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance with
this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares and Non-Employee
Equity Awards converted into the right to receive consideration in connection
with the Merger (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose. __

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time but in any event not later than five Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Each holder of record of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (x) surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent
(or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may
reasonably request), in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares. Upon payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or
transferred will forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so
transferred is registered if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate
will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and, in
each case, the transferor provides the Exchange Agent and Parent all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and establishes to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and Parent that any applicable transfer or
other Taxes have been paid. Each Certificate and each Uncertificated Share
will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.3 the
consideration into which the Shares will have been converted pursuant to
Section 2.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2.

 



-8- (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article 2 will be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, _subject_ ,
_however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there will be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as
otherwise provided by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or
Non-Employee Equity Awards one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any such holders who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 will thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate, Uncertificated Shares or
Non-Employee Equity Awards will not have been exchanged in accordance
with this Article 2 prior to five years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any amounts payable pursuant
to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such amounts will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate (which will not exceed the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate), the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this
Agreement.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger
Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Exchange Agent to
deduct and withhold) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, Options or RSUs such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the applicable tax Law. Each payor shall take all action that may be
necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and
properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

 



-9- SECTION 2.4. _Company Options; RSUs_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding Option, each Option that is
outstanding, unexercised and vested (or required to vest as a result of the
Merger), subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Section
2.4, will terminate and be cancelled at the Effective Time and each holder of
an Option will be entitled to receive from the Company, and will receive as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, in settlement of each Option
an Option Cash Amount. The " _ _Option Cash Amount__ " will be equal to the
net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the applicable exercise price per Share otherwise issuable
upon exercise of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject
to such Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the exercise price per Share of any Option
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, effective as of the Effective
Time, such Option shall automatically be cancelled, without any consideration
being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding RSU, each RSU that is outstanding,
unsettled and vested (or required to vest as a result of the Merger), subject
to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Section 2.4, will
terminate and be canceled at the Effective Time and each holder of an RSU will
be entitled to receive from the Company, and will receive as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, in settlement of each RSU an RSU
Cash Amount. The " _ _RSU Cash Amount__ " will be equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Shares issuable in settlement of the RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time (taking into account any acceleration of
vesting), multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any applicable
withholdings for Taxes.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any outstanding Option: (i) each Option that is
outstanding, unexercised, has an exercise price per share that is less than
the Merger Consideration and is not vested (or required to vest as a result
of the Merger) (an " _ _Unvested In-the-Money Option__ ") and is held by a
Current Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) each
RSU that is outstanding and is not vested (or required to vest as a result of
the Merger) and is held by a Current Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, an " _ _Unvested RSU__ "), shall, in the case of each of
clauses "(i)" and "(ii)," be assumed or replaced and become: (A) in the case
of each such Unvested In-the-Money Option, a stock option to purchase shares
of the Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent (" _ _Parent
Common Stock__ ") and (B) in the case of each Unvested RSU, a restricted
stock unit in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) From and after the Effective Time: (i) each Unvested In-the-Money Option
assumed or replaced by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent
Common Stock; (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying each
such Unvested In-the-Money Option shall be determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Unvested In-the-
Money Option by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (iii) 

 



-10-  the per-share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of each such Unvested In-the-Money Option shall be determined by
_dividing_ : (A) the exercise price per share of such Unvested In-the-Money
Option, _by_ (B) the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent; and (iv) subject to the terms of the stock
option agreement by which such Unvested In-the-Money Option is evidenced, any
restriction on the exercise of such Unvested In-the-Money Option shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Unvested In-the-Money Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged; _provided, however,_ that Parents board of
directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any committee thereof
with respect to such Unvested In-the-Money Option.

(e) From and after the Effective Time: (A) each Unvested RSU assumed or
replaced by Parent will, upon the vesting thereof, become a restricted stock
unit in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock; (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying such Unvested RSU shall be determined by
_multiplying_ : (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Unvested RSU; _by_ (2) the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting
number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and
(C) any restriction on the vesting or settlement or issuance of shares under
such Unvested RSU shall continue in full force and effect, and the term,
vesting schedule and other provisions of such Unvested RSU shall otherwise
remain unchanged; _provided, however,_ that Parents board of directors or
a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
Companys board of directors or any committee thereof with respect to such
Unvested RSU.

 

(f) Parent shall not assume any Options or RSUs, or substitute any Options or
RSUs with an equivalent option, restricted stock unit or right, held by any
individual who, at the Effective Time, is not a Current Employee (each, a " _
_Non-Company Employee__ "). Each unvested Option held by a Non-Company
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated
and treated as a vested Option in accordance with Section 2.4(a). Each
unvested RSU held by a Non-Company Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be accelerated and treated as a vested RSU in accordance
with Section 2.4(b).

(g) At the Effective Time, if Parent elects to do so, Parent may assume any or
all of the Stock Plans or merge any or all of the Stock Plan into any equity
incentive plan of Parent. If Parent elects to so assume or merge any Stock
Plan, then, under such Stock Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock
awards, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, using the share
reserves of such Stock Plan as of the Effective Time, except that: (i) rather
than any shares of Company Common Stock being covered by such awards, shares
of Parent Common Stock will be covered by such awards; (ii) all references
in any assumed Stock Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall
be deemed amended to refer instead to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock determined by multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company
Common Stock by the Conversion Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down
to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iii)
Parents board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority and responsibility of the Companys board of directors or any
committee thereof with respect to the administration of such Stock Plan.
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC, no later than 30 days after the
Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form),
if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to the Options

 



-11-  and RSUs assumed or replaced by Parent in accordance with Sections 2.4(d)
and 2.4(e) and Parent shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
assumed or replaced Options and RSUs remain outstanding.

(h) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Options or RSUs a letter
describing the treatment of and payment for or assumption of such equity
awards pursuant to this Section 2.4 and, if applicable,
providing instructions for use in obtaining payment therefor; _provided_ ,
_however_ _,_ that the Company shall not mail any such notice without the
prior review and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) thereof by Parent.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the later of ten Business Days after the Effective Time or the first
payroll date after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, payable with respect to Options and RSUs through, to the
extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll to the holders of
Options and RSUs; provided, however, that to the extent the holder of an
Option or an RSU is not, and was not at any time during the vesting period of
the Option or RSU, as applicable, a Company employee (each such Option or RSU
a "Non-Employee Equity Award"), the consideration payable pursuant to Section
2.4(a) with respect to such Options or pursuant to Section 2.4(b) with respect
to such RSUs will be paid by the Exchange Agent in the manner described in
the letter referred to in Section 2.4(h).

(j) The Company shall take all actions necessary or required under the ESPP
and applicable Law to, contingent on the Effective Time, (i) ensure that,
except for the 6-month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on August
17, 2016, no offering period or purchase period will be authorized or
commenced on or after the date of this Agreement and (ii) if the Closing will
occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under the ESPP on
the date of this Agreement, cause the rights of participants in the ESPP with
respect to any such offering period (and purchase period thereunder) then
underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the last Business Day
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the last day of such offering period
(such date or the date such offering period terminates by its terms, if
earlier, the " _ _Final Purchase Date__ ") and purchase period and by making
such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. The
Company shall cause the exercise (as of the Final Purchase Date) of each
outstanding purchase right under the ESPP and terminate the ESPP in its
entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time, contingent upon the
Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take
all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP) that
are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.4(j). In any event, the Company Board shall terminate the ESPP prior to
the Effective Time

(k) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the Stock Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 2.4 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
holders of Options, RSUs and outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP have
no rights with respect thereto form and after the Effective Time other than
those specifically provided in this Section 2.4.

 



-12- (l) The Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity compensation held by
Company employees subject to non-U.S. law in another manner to take into
account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

SECTION 2.5. _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by any Person who (i) is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _ _Section__ _ _ __ _ _262__
") and (ii) as of the Effective Time, has neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost such Persons rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL with
respect to such Shares (" _ _Appraisal Shares__ "), will not be converted into
the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a), but
rather the holders of Appraisal Shares will be entitled to be paid the fair
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder will fail to perfect or otherwise will
waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal
Shares will cease and such Appraisal Shares will be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable
solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.2(a). Within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will provide each of the holders of Shares with the notice contemplated by
Section 262 of the DGCL.

SECTION 2.6. _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each Constituent
Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

ARTICLE 3

Except as set forth in (i) the Companys Annual Report filed on Form 10-K on
March 10, 2016 and the Company SEC Reports filed by the Company with the SEC

_Available Company SEC Document__ ") (excluding any disclosures set forth
therein, including in any "risk factor" section thereof, in any section
related to forward-looking statements or any similar precautionary sections,
to the extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature) to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the text of the
Available Company SEC Document (without reference to the contents of any
other document referred to therein) that such disclosure is applicable to any
section or subsection of this Article III or (ii) the disclosure letter (each
section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and
warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein, _provided that_ any
disclosure set forth with respect to any particular section of this Agreement
will be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all other applicable sections
of this Agreement if it is reasonably apparent from the wording of such
disclosure (without reference to the contents of any other document referred
to therein) that such disclosure is applicable to qualify such
other applicable sections) previously delivered by the Company to Parent (the
" _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ "), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



-13- SECTION 3.1. _Organization_. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
is a corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and possesses all
governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted, except for such franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations and approvals, the lack of which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as may be amended after the date of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 5.1, the copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company which are incorporated by reference as
exhibits to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 are complete and correct copies of such documents and
contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 3.2. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 200,000,000

November 7, 2016 (the " _ _Capitalization Date__ "): (i) 36,787,403 Shares
were issued and outstanding (which excludes Shares held by the Company as
treasury shares); (ii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; and (iii) no Shares were held by the Company in its treasury or

such date and (ii) there have been no issuances or grants of Options, RSUs or

(including Shares estimated in clause (iv) above). Section 3.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and complete list, as

to purchase or receive Shares granted under the Stock Plans, any sub-plan
thereto or otherwise, and, for each such Option, RSU and other right, the
number of Shares subject thereto, the terms of vesting

 



-14-  (including any performance-based vesting and the extent to which it will
become accelerated as a result of the Merger, either alone or in connection
with any other event) and vested status, the grant and expiration dates, the
exercise price, if applicable, the name of the holder thereof, whether such
Option is an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code, a
non-qualified stock option or otherwise, whether such Option may be early

no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness or securities of
the Company having the right to vote (or, other than the outstanding

rights that remain in effect in, any Intellectual Property Rights that are or
were Company Owned Intellectual Property Rights and are material to the

transferred to any Person in the past three (3) years ownership of any
Intellectual Property Rights that were Company Owned Intellectual Property

businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Licenses will not include (A) non-disclosure agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business that do not contain an express license grant, (B)

exclusive licenses to software and materials licensed on standard terms as
open-source, public-source or freeware or (ii) has granted licenses in, under,

not contain an express license grant or (B) non-exclusive licenses, including
terms of use, terms of service, software as a service or "SaaS" licenses or
end user license agreements granted or entered into in the ordinary course of
business or in connection with the sale of any services or products of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries: (i) none of the Company Products does, and the operation
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as such business
is currently conducted, does not, infringe, misappropriate, dilute, or
otherwise violate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third Person and no
such infringement, misappropriation, or violation has occurred in the past
three (3) years; (ii) there are no pending, or to the knowledge of the
Company threatened, claims by any Person, alleging infringement,

Subsidiaries of any Intellectual Property Rights of a third party
or challenging the validity, enforceability, ownership or use of any of the
Company Owned Intellectual Property Rights; and (iii) there are no pending or
threatened claims by the Company or its Subsidiaries alleging infringement,
misappropriation, violation or dilution by a third party of any Company Owned

 



-25-  Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, no third
party is infringing, violating, diluting, or misappropriating any material
Company Owned Intellectual Property Rights. Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of the Company, no Company
Intellectual Property Rights will terminate or cease to be a valid right of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries by reason of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance of the Company of
its obligations hereunder, or the consummation by the Company of the Merger.

 

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to
protect their rights in confidential information and trade secrets that they
wish to protect or any trade secrets or confidential information of third
parties provided to them under obligations of confidentiality. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and each Company Subsidiary has, and has
at all times had, a practice of requiring each Person engaged in the
development of any Intellectual Property Rights or Technology for the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute a proprietary information and
confidentiality agreement protecting such trade secrets and confidential
information and assigning to the Company or a Company Subsidiary all such
Intellectual Property Rights and Technology.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is under any obligation to
license any material Company Intellectual Property Rights to any Governmental
Authority, and no Governmental Authority has any rights or licenses to any
material Company Owned Intellectual Property Rights, in each case as a result
of any funding received by it or any Company Subsidiary from any
Governmental Authority.

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, except as would not be material to the
operations of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, there are (i) no defects in any of the Company Products that would
prevent the same from performing materially in accordance with their
obligations to customers under written customer agreements; and (ii) no
viruses, worms, Trojan horses or similar disabling codes or programs in any
of the same. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries possess all source code and other materials used by the Company

Company Products, except where the lack of such possession as would not be
material to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
not disclosed, delivered, licensed or otherwise made available, and do not
have a duty or obligation (whether present, contingent, or otherwise) to
disclose, deliver, license, or otherwise make available, to any Person, any
source code that embodies material Technology of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or material Company Intellectual Property Rights for any Company
Product. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed or
otherwise made available any open-source, public-source or freeware code in a
manner that violates the license thereof or would require (including through
the imposition of a license condition) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to make available any source code for or grant licenses to any material
Technology of the Company or its Subsidiaries or material Company Intellectual
Property Rights.

 



-26- (g) To the knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the Transactions will
not (i) in any material respect, violate or result in the material breach,
modification, cancellation, termination, or suspension of any In-Bound License
or Out-Bound License, (ii) result in the release of any source code or other
proprietary confidential Technology of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or in the granting of any right or licenses to any Company Owned Intellectual
Property Rights to any third party, or (iii) subject the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any non-compete or other restriction on the operation or
scope of their respective businesses in any In-Bound License or Out-Bound
License. All In-Bound Licenses and Out-Bound Licenses will survive the Closing
in accordance with their terms for the benefit of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(h) No Legal Proceeding by any third party is pending and served or, to the
knowledge of the Company, pending and not served or threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has any of them received any written
claim or notice since January 1, 2014, in each case with respect to any

the material breach of any material Contract under which any such Company
Product has been supplied or provided, in each case, which remains unresolved.

Company Subsidiaries is party to any collective bargaining agreement and there

SECTION 5.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees and agents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to, upon Parents reasonable advance
notice to the Company, afford the officers, employees and agents of Parent and
Merger Sub reasonable access during normal business hours to its officers,
employees, agents, properties, facilities, books, records, contracts and other
assets and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and
other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers,
employees or agents, may reasonably request. Parent and Merger Sub will have
the right to make such due diligence investigations as Parent and Merger Sub
will deem necessary or reasonable, upon reasonable notice to the Company; 
_provided, however_ , that any such investigations will be conducted under the
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the normal operation of the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.2(a) will
require the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to disclose any information
concerning Takeover Proposals, which will be governed by Section 6.6, or any
information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable discretion
(i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene
any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or Contract entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party); _provided, however_ , that information will be disclosed subject to
execution of a joint defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may
be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the extent the Company
determines doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying
with applicable Antitrust Laws. The parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 19, 2016,
between Parent and the Company (the " _ _Confidentiality Agreement__ ") will
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, and all
information disclosed pursuant to this Section 5.2 will be subject to the
obligations of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

ARTICLE 6

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 6.1. _Company Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 6.1(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of
a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.
During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or

 



-39-  modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company
Board Recommendation or (B) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _
_Company Adverse Change Recommendation__ "); (ii) fail to publicly reaffirm
its recommendation of this Agreement within ten Business Days after Parent so
requests in writing, _provided that_ , unless a Takeover Proposal will have
been publicly disclosed, Parent may only make such request once every thirty
(30) days; (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to execute or
enter into any Contract with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon,
terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise materially
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Transactions (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (iv) take or fail to take any
formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement
in connection with a tender or exchange offer by a third party, other than a
recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect
to a Takeover Proposal until the close of business on the tenth Business Day
after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Takeover Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
Section 6.1).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to accepting, for the first time, for payment and paying for
such number of Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as satisfies the Minimum Tender Condition (the " _
_Offer Acceptance Time__ "):

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal (which
Takeover Proposal did not result from or arise out of a breach of Section
6.6) from any Person that has not been withdrawn and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, the Company Board has determined,
in good faith, that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then (x)
the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the
Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into a Specified Agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if: (A) the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (B)
the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(i), in each case, with respect to such Superior
Proposal (a " _ _Superior Proposal__ ____Determination Notice__ ") (which
notice shall have included a copy of the definitive Specified Agreement (in
the case of clause "(y)"), the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal) at least four Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse
Change Recommendation or termination (which notice will not constitute a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation) (the " _ _Superior Proposal Notice
Period__ "); and (C) (1) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, Parent
may propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make

 



-40-  other proposals so that such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal, and the Company shall have made its Representatives
available to, and negotiated in good faith with, Parent with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, during such period, and (2)
after the end of such period, after considering the results of such
negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, and
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, the
Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, (I) that such Takeover
Proposal still is a Superior Proposal and (II) that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(e)(i) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(i) will also apply to every material
amendment to any Takeover Proposal and require that a new Superior Proposal
Determination Notice be delivered to Parent in accordance with clause "(B)"
above; provided, however, that the "matching" period described in clauses
"(B)" and "(C)" shall be two Business Days rather than the initial four
Business Day period); and

 

(ii) other than in connection with a Takeover Proposal, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have given
Parent prior written notice of its intention to make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation as a result of such Change in Circumstance (a " _ _Change in
Circumstance Determination Notice__ ") (which notice shall have included a
reasonably detailed summary of such Change in Circumstance) at least four
Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation
(which notice will not constitute a Company Adverse Change Recommendation)
(the " _ _Change in Circumstance Notice Period__ "); and (C) (1) during the
Change in Circumstance Notice Period, Parent may propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals so that such Change in
Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation, and the Company shall have made its Representatives available
to, and negotiated in good faith with, Parent with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposals, if any, during such period, and (2) after the
end of such period, after considering the results of such negotiations and
giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, and after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor, the Company
Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change
in Circumstance would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law (for the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of this Section 6.1(b)(ii) will also apply to every material change
to the facts and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and
require that a new Change in Circumstance Determination Notice be delivered to
Parent in accordance with clause "(B)" and "(C)" above, provided, however,
that the "matching" period described in clauses "(B)" shall be two Business
Days rather than the initial four Business Day period).

 



-41- SECTION 6.2. _Employee and Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a "change of control" (or
similar phrase) within the meaning of each Company Employee Benefit Plan, as
applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all Company
Employee Benefit Plans listed in Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure
Letter or filed as exhibits to the Available Company SEC Documents and all
accrued benefits vested thereunder; it being understood and agreed that
nothing in this Section 6.2(a) will prevent Parent from amending or
terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other agreement in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(b) As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or one of the Company
Subsidiaries shall continue to employ the employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time. For a period of one year
following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide, or cause to be
provided, to those employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who
are employed by them as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
continue to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any
Affiliate thereof) during such one-year period the base salary (or base
wages, as the case may be) no less favorable than the base salary (or base
wages, as applicable) provided by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided that_
Parent shall be under no obligation to retain any employee or group of
employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries other than as required by
applicable Law.

 

(c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, subject to applicable law and the terms of such plan,
program or arrangement, cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat
the prior service with the Company and its Affiliates of each person who is
an employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing (a " _ _Company Employee__ ") (to the same extent such service
is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company
or its Affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to
participate in and vesting thereunder (but not benefit accrual) and for
sabbatical purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
will not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit. With
respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) for the
benefit of Company Employees, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) ensure that Company Employees will be given credit for any
deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in
any other health or welfare benefit plan for which deductibles or co-payments
are required and (ii) waive any preexisting condition that was waived under
the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Closing or waiting period limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a
Company Employee on or after the Closing. Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall cause any accrued but unused vacation, sick leave or other paid time off
(excluding sabbatical) that is accrued as of the Closing Date to be paid out
to Company Employees through payroll following the Closing, less applicable
withholding Taxes.

(d) If directed in writing by Parent prior to the Effective Time and, with
respect to each plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _ _401(k) Plan__ "), prior to
the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, the Company shall take (or
cause to be taken) all actions reasonably determined by

 



-42-  Parent to be necessary or appropriate to terminate any such employee benefit
plan, with such termination effective as of the business day immediately prior
to the date on which the Offer Acceptance Time occurs with respect to any
such 401(k) Plan. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
401(k) Plan(s) have been timely terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
board of directors of the Company or the Company Subsidiary, as the case may
be. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably request.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed so as
to, (i) constitute an amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan;
(ii) create any third party rights in any such current or former service
provider of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof); or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company, the Company Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time) to adopt or maintain any particular plan or program or other
compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time or prevent the Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time) from modifying or terminating any such plan,
program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time.

SECTION 6.3. _Efforts; Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable, under applicable
Antitrust Laws and otherwise, to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, clearances, decisions,
declarations, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods
from Governmental Authorities (the " _ _Governmental Consents__ ") and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain any such Governmental Consents by or from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority in connection
with any Antitrust Law; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties; and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary shall be required to agree to the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or
accelerated payments), or the provision of additional security (including
a guaranty), in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Company
Material Contract.

(b) By way of illustration and not limitation, the parties agree to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, and to cause their Affiliates to
take, all actions and steps requested or required by any Governmental
Authority as a condition to granting any Governmental Consent, and to cause
the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or other Governmental
Authorities of any other jurisdiction for which Governmental Consents
are sought with respect to the Transactions, so as to obtain such
Governmental Consents, and to avoid the commencement

 



-43-  of a lawsuit by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Authorities under
Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of,
any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or
delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond the Expiration Date.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable,
to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than ten Business Days after the date
hereof, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and Report forms as
required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions; and (ii) cooperate
with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing and making, any
other filings or notifications are required to be made with, or Governmental
Consents are required to be obtained from, any other Governmental Authorities
in connection with the Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.3,
during the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority or brought by a third party
before any Governmental Authority, in each case, with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ
or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) upon request,
promptly furnish to the other party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants retained by
such counsel, with copies of documents provided to or received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)"
documents as those terms are used in the rules and regulations under the HSR
Act), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit
disclosure to counsel and outside consultants retained by such counsel, and to
the extent reasonably practicable, consult in advance and cooperate with the
other parties and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi)
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or by any Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each party hereto shall provide
advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the other party to
be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal
to be made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each party shall
supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may reasonably be requested by any Governmental
Authority, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date
with any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other
materials received by any party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Authority in connection with such applications or filings for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub shall pay all
filing fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign

 



-44-  Antitrust Laws, but the Company shall bear its own costs for the preparation
of any such filings. Neither party shall commit to or agree with any
Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act, or pull and refile under the HSR Act, or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

SECTION 6.4. _Public Statements_. The initial press release relating to this
Agreement will be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and
thereafter, subject to Section 5.2, except for any disclosure required by Law
or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or trading
market, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with each other prior to issuing, and to provide each other
with the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (to
the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement).

SECTION 6.5. _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees to give prompt notice to
Parent (i) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure by the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Offer or Merger to fail to be
satisfied, respectively, except that no such notification will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the remedies available to the
parties under this Agreement; _provided, however, that_ the failure to notify
Parent of a breach of any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement pursuant to this Section will not constitute a breach of covenant
in any material respect for purposes of paragraph (d) of _Exhibit B_.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent agrees to give prompt notice to the
Company (i) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it
in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate or of any failure by Parent
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, except that no
such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or the remedies
available to the parties under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.6. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this Section 6.6, during the Pre-Closing Period,
the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the Representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to,
(i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage the submission of, any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, offer 

 



-45-  or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal (a " _Takeover Inquiry_ "), (ii) approve or recommend any
Takeover Proposal, enter into any agreement, agreement-in-principle or letter
of intent with respect to or accept any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry
(or resolve to or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing), (iii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information in connection with, or knowingly take
any action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry, or (iv) terminate, amend, waive or
fail to enforce any rights under any "standstill" or other similar agreement
between the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any Parent (other
than Parent);  _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, in response to an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal from a third
party that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board determines in
good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial advisor and outside
counsel) is, or could reasonably be expected to result in or lead to, a
Superior Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and afford access
to the business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary, in each case, pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with such person making such Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives (including to solicit a revised Takeover Proposal), in the
case of each of clauses "(x)" and "(y)," if and only if: (1) there shall have
been no material breach or violation of the terms of this Section 6.6(a) in
connection with such person making such Takeover Proposal; (2) prior to taking
any action contemplated in clauses "(x)" or "(y)" with respect to such
person, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law; (3) contemporaneously with furnishing or making
available any information to such person, the Company furnishes or makes
available such information to Parent (to the extent not previously furnished
or made available to Parent); and (4) the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
between the Company and such person making such Takeover Proposal does not
prohibit or restrict the Company in any way from complying with
its disclosure obligations to Parent under Section 6.1 and Section 6.6 of
this Agreement (without giving effect to the proviso at the end of Section
6.6(c)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.6(a),
during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not be required to enforce,
and shall be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such provision prohibits
or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company
Board (or any committee thereof), _provided that_ the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that so
enforcing or not waiving any such provision of any standstill
or confidentiality agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing
to the holders of Company Common Stock a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) from making any
disclosure to the holders of Company Common Stock if the Company Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the

 



-46-  stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, or (iii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that: (A) this Section 6.6(b) shall not be
deemed to permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation except as and to the extent permitted by Section 6.1(b); and
(B) any such communication or disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation unless it is accompanied by a statement of the
Company Board expressly reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation in
connection with such communication or disclosure.

 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.6, the Company shall promptly (within one Business Day) notify
Parent in writing of any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry (and of any
material amendments or modifications thereto), or any request for information
with respect to any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry, that is received
during the Pre-Closing Period, including the material terms and conditions of
any Takeover Proposal, Takeover Inquiry or request received during the Pre-
Closing Period (unless the Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry is in written
form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof and any
material amendments or modifications thereto) and the identity of the Person
making such Takeover Proposal, Takeover Inquiry or request) _; provided,
however,_ nothing in this Section 6.6(c) shall require the Company to breach
any confidentiality obligations of the Company in existence prior to the date
of this Agreement to a Person making a Takeover Proposal that would preclude
any of the disclosures contemplated by this Section 6.6(c) regarding such
Persons Takeover Proposal.

(d) The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to cease
immediately all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date
of this Agreement regarding any Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry. The
Company also shall promptly (and in any event within three Business Days
following the date hereof) (A) request in writing that each Person that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion thereof to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (B) cease
furnishing or making available any non-public information regarding the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to such Person, including by
prohibiting such Person from having access to any physical or electronic data
rooms. Nothing in the Section 6.6(d) shall be deemed to prevent the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives from taking any
action otherwise permitted by Section 6.6(a) through (c).

SECTION 6.7. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each an " _
_Indemnified Party__ "), with respect to actions or omissions taken by
an Indemnified Party prior to the Effective Time in his or her capacity as an
officer or director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as provided in the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, in each case as in effect on
the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any indemnification agreements
identified in Section 3.16(a)(x) of the Company Disclosure

 



-47-  Letter, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, copies of which have
been Made Available to Parent, including provisions relating to the
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any action or suit, will
survive the Merger and will remain in full force and effect. From the
Effective Time through the six year anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to abide
by such indemnification obligations to the Indemnified Parties.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the Companys
officers and directors liability insurance policies, in effect on the date
of this Agreement (the " _ _D andO Insurance__"), for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, but only to the extent related to actions or
omissions prior to the Effective Time; _provided that_ (i) the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such former directors or
officers and (ii) such substitution will not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the " _
_Maximum Amount__ ") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant
hereto; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of the annual
premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall procure and
maintain for such six-year period as much coverage as reasonably practicable
for the Maximum Amount. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance by obtaining a
six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the
DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy will satisfy the provisions of this
Section 6.7(b).

 

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.7 will survive the consummation of the Merger and will not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom
this Section 6.8 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.7 applies will be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.7,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.7).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and will not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

SECTION 6.8. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and
cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares and Company
Stock Awards in the Transaction by applicable individuals and to cause such
dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

 



-48- SECTION 6.9. _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, shall approve, as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, each
agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Company or any of its
Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company that
are effective as of the date of this Agreement or are entered into after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Acceptance Time pursuant to
which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and shall
take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act.

SECTION 6.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, sales, use, real property
transfer, registration, transfer, stamp, recording and similar Taxes and fees
shall be paid by the Person or Persons on whom such Taxes and fees are imposed
by applicable Law.

 

SECTION 6.11. _Merger Sub Stockholder Consent_. Immediately following the
execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance
with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, a written consent adopting this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.12. _No Control of the Other Party_ __ _s Business_. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are
not intended to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
business or operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over their own business and operations.

SECTION 6.13. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of, and give Parent the opportunity to participate, at
Parents expense, in the defense of, any claim or litigation related to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions brought by any
stockholder of the Company or any holder of the Companys other securities
against the Company and/or its directors or officers and the Company shall
consider the Parents advice with respect to such claim or litigation,
including the defense and settlement thereof. The Company shall not agree to
any full or partial compromise or settlement of any such claim or litigation
without the Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

SECTION 6.14. _NASDAQ Listing_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to continue the listing of the Company Common Stock on
NASDAQ during the term of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law
(including the rules and regulations of NASDAQ) to enable the de-listing by
the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the
deregistration of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

 



-49- SECTION 6.15. _Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
is or may become applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the Transactions.

at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to this Agreement) will have expired, without
the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided,

pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if: (i) the expiration of the Offer is
attributable to the failure of an Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (ii)

perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Offer Acceptance Time will not

any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Offer

-50- (d) by either the Company or Parent, if any Judgment issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by a Governmental Authority, or Law or other legal
restraint or prohibition making the acceptance for payment of, and payment
for, shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the Merger
illegal or otherwise preventing the consummation thereof will be in effect
and will have become final and nonappealable; _provided, however, that_ a

Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed, or will have

commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board shall have
failed to recommend against acceptance of such offer and to publicly reaffirm
its recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger; (iv) a
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced, and the Company shall
have failed to issue a press release that reaffirms its recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer and the Merger, within five Business Days after such

Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder;

 

(g) by the Company, if Parent has breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (B) is incapable of
being cured by the Outside Date or has not been cured by Parent within thirty
days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such breach or failure to
perform; _provided, however_ , that the Company will not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if the Company is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation hereunder;

 



-51- (h) by the Company upon two Business Days notice to Parent, if Merger Sub
will have failed to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer within the period specified in Section 1.1(b) or will
have failed to accept for purchase all Shares validly tendered (and not
validly withdrawn) as of the expiration of the Offer (as may be extended),
which failure, in each case, has not been cured by Parent within five Business
Days of the date the Company gives Parent notice of such failure to perform;
_provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) if such failure by Merger Sub
results from the failure by the Company (or its Affiliates) to perform any
covenant required to be performed by the Company (or is Affiliates)
under this Agreement _;_ or

(i) by the Company, in order to accept a Superior Proposal and enter into a
definitive agreement providing for the implementation of such Superior
Proposal (a " _ _Specified Agreement__ "), _provided that_ (A) the Company has
complied in all material respects with the requirements of Section 6.1(b)(i)
and Section 6.6 and (B) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement,
the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee contemplated by Section 8.3(a)
and enters into the Specified Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement will forthwith become null and void
except for the provisions of (i) Section 5.2(b), (ii) Section 8.2, (iii)
Section 8.3, and (iv) Article 9, which will survive such termination;
_provided, however,_ _that_ nothing herein will relieve any party from
liability for Fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement for any
and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a
result of such Fraud or willful and material breach. The Confidentiality
Agreement (as amended pursuant to Section 5.2(b)) will not be affected by the
termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 8.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 8.1(e), the
Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after
termination of this Agreement, or (ii) pursuant to Section 8.1(i), the Company
shall, concurrently with or prior to (and as a condition to) the termination
of this Agreement, in the case of each of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)," pay
Parent a fee in immediately available funds of $21,000,000 (the " _
_Termination Fee__ ").

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (x) pursuant to (A) Section 8.1(b) where
the failure of the Offer Acceptance Time to have occurred is attributable to
the failure of the Minimum Tender Condition to have been satisfied, or (B)
Section 8.1(c), (y) at any time on or after the date hereof and prior to such
termination a Takeover Proposal will have been publicly announced, and
(z) within twelve months after the date of such termination, the Company
consummates, or enters into a Contract with respect to, any transaction
specified in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" (and which transaction is
ultimately consummated), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination
Fee on the date of consummation of such transaction. For purposes of this
Section 8.3(b), "Takeover Proposal" will have the meaning ascribed thereto
except that references in such definition to "15%" will be replaced by "50%."

(c) In the event that Parent or its designee receive full payment pursuant to
this Section 8.3, the receipt of the Termination Fee will be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective 

 



-52-  Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of
the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination.
Subject to Section 8.2, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3 will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub in connection with the termination of this
Agreement in the circumstances in which such fee becomes payable.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

 

(e) All costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses of the Exchange Agent.
