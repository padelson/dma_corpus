 Section 2.2 _Determination of Preliminary Working Capital_. At least two business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate executed on behalf of Seller by the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, dated the date of its delivery, stating that there has been conducted under the supervision of such officer a review of all relevant information and data then available, including the scanned physical inventory contemplated by _Section 2.4(a)(vii_ ), and setting forth Sellers good faith estimate of Final Working Capital (" _Preliminary Working Capital_ "). 

   

 Section 2.3 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Securities shall be equal to $1,150,000,000 _minus_ the Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and, if applicable, the applicable Lease Agreement Amount (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.4_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 Section 2.4 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. 

   

 (a) _Purchase Price Adjustment  Working Capital_ 

    

 (i) Within the later of 60 days after the Closing Date and 30 days after delivery to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.16(c)_ of the audited balance sheet of the Business as of January 28, 2006, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth Working Capital as of the Effective Time and each of the line items reflected therein as set forth on the Reference Working Capital Statement (the determination of Working Capital, as it may be adjusted under this  _Section 2.4(a)_ in the event of a WC Notice of Disagreement, is referred to as " _Final Working Capital_ "). Buyer shall reasonably assist Seller and its representatives in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of Buyer, the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries for such purpose. Seller shall provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records (including work papers) of Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of reviewing the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement. 

   

 (ii) The Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the later of (1) the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer and (2) the 90th day after the Closing Date, unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (" _WC Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller before such date. A WC Notice of Disagreement must set forth Buyers determination of Final Working Capital and specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement with Sellers determination. The only disagreements that may be set forth in the WC Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this  _Section 2.4(a)_ are those that relate to (x) any claimed inconsistencies between the principles used in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and the principles used in the preparation of the Reference Working Capital Statement; (y) any disputes regarding the Inventory Schedule pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(viii)_; or (z) errors in mathematical computation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 2.4(a)_, no disagreement set forth in the WC Notice of Disagreement may relate to the principles used in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement, so long as those principles are consistently applied with the Reference Working Capital Statement. If a valid WC Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner, then the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and the Final Working Capital shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date the parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to all matters specified in the WC Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the WC Arbitrator. 

   

 (iii) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a WC Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in the WC Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such matters, then the matters that remain in dispute shall be promptly submitted to an arbitrator (the " _WC Arbitrator_ ") for review and resolution. The WC Arbitrator shall be Ernst and Young LLP, or if Ernst and Young LLP is not available, the WC 

   ##### 

  

   

Arbitrator shall be a nationally recognized independent public accounting
firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties in writing, provided that the WC
Arbitrator will not be an accounting firm used by either Seller or Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates for audit or valuation purposes. The
procedures for the arbitration shall be determined by the WC Arbitrator. The
WC Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within
30 days following completion of the submissions to the WC Arbitrator.
Any item not specifically referred to in the WC Notice of Disagreement shall
be deemed final and binding on Buyer and Seller in the manner set forth in
the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement. The WC Arbitrator shall determine
Final Working Capital based solely on presentations made by Seller and Buyer
(and not by independent review). 

   

 (iv) The Non-Prevailing WC Party in any arbitration before the WC Arbitrator shall pay the fees and expenses of the WC Arbitrator. A party is the " _Non-Prevailing WC Party_ " if the WC Arbitrators determination of Final Working Capital is closer to the other partys determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the WC Arbitrator, than it is to that partys determination of Final Working Capital, as submitted to the WC Arbitrator. In resolving any matter specified in the WC Notice of Disagreement, the WC Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. 

   

 (v) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Reference Working Capital_ " means $313,817,851, and " _Adjustment Amount_ " means $4,600,000. 

   

 (vi) The term " _Working Capital_ " means (i) the sum of the asset accounts of the Business included in the Reference Working Capital Statement, less (ii) the sum of the liability accounts of the Business included in the Reference Working Capital Statement, less (iii) the Adjustment Amount. The computation of Working Capital will be done in a manner consistent with the methods used in the preparation of the Reference Working Capital Statement, and the governing principle will be that the adjustment contemplated by this  _Section 2.4(a)_ can be appropriately measured only when the Reference Working Capital and the Final Working Capital are computed on the same basis, using the same principles and methodologies consistently applied. The parties intend for the asset accounts and the liability accounts included in the Reference Working Capital Statement and the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis with the policies used by Seller in connection with the preparation of the Year-End Balance Sheet, it being understood and agreed that (v) only selected accounts are being included in the Reference Working Capital Statement and the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement, (w) the Reference Working Capital Statement is an average of the specified account balances during fiscal 2004, certain of which have been averaged on a monthly basis and certain of which have been averaged on a quarterly basis, and the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement shall be as of the Cut-Off Date (and not an average), (x) allocations relating to corporate overhead and shared services are not included in the Reference Working Capital Statement and shall not be included in the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement, (y) the Reference Working Capital Statement does not, and the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement shall not, include any property Tax accounts relating to property Taxes that are past due 

   ##### 

  

   

and payable and (z) the Reference Working Capital Statement does not, and
the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement shall not, include any asset or
liability that is retained following the Cut-Off Date by Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries)
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the Reference Working
Capital Statement has not been prepared in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the parties shall work together in good faith to make
appropriate adjustments to such statement. If any such adjustment is made,
the Final Working Capital will be computed on the same basis, using the same
principles and methodologies consistently applied. 

   

 (vii) Seller will perform a scanned physical inventory within thirty (30) calendar days prior to January 30, 2006 to determine the quantity of inventory of the Business located on the Real Estate (the " _January Inventory_ "). Immediately upon completion of any such inventory tabulation, Seller shall furnish Buyer with a copy of the physical inventory data. Seller shall prepare a schedule that contains a roll forward of the physical inventory data to the Cut-Off Date, using Sellers standard procedures for rolling forward physical inventory data (the " _Inventory Schedule_ "), and promptly following the completion of such Inventory Schedule, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of the Inventory Schedule. 

   

 (viii) The procedures performed pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(vii)_ shall be taken in accordance with Sellers typical inventory procedures. The cost of taking any such inventory shall be borne by Seller. At its sole expense, each party may have a reasonable number of representatives present to observe the taking of the January Inventory and may verify the January Inventory tabulation as conducted. In the event that there is any dispute regarding an Inventory Schedule prepared pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)(vii)_, such dispute shall be resolved in connection with the determination of Final Working Capital, as set forth in _Sections 2.4(a)(ii)  (a)(iv)_. Subject to the resolution of any such dispute, the Inventory Schedule as of the Cut-Off Date shall be used for determination of the applicable line items of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement. 

   

 (b) _Purchase Price Adjustment  Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities_. 

   

 (i) Within the later of 60 days after the Closing Date and 30 days after delivery to Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.16(c)_ of the audited balance sheet of the Business as of January 28, 2006, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement_ ") setting forth the Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and other information, in each case substantially in the format used in the Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities Statement, as of the Cut-Off Date (the determination of Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, as it may be adjusted under this _Section 2.4(b)_ in the event of a NUBL Notice of Disagreement, is referred to as " _Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities_ "). Buyer shall reasonably assist Seller and its representatives in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records of Buyer, the Companies and the Subsidiaries for such purpose. Seller shall provide Buyer and its representatives reasonable access at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, books and records (including work papers) of Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of reviewing the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) The Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the later of (1) the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer and (2) the 90th day after the Closing Date, unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (" _NUBL Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller before such date. A NUBL Notice of Disagreement must set forth Buyers determination of Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement with Sellers determination. The only disagreements that may be set forth in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ are those that relate to (x) any claimed inconsistencies between the principles used in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement and the Agreed NUBL Principles or (y) errors in mathematical computation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.4(b)_, no disagreement set forth in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement may relate to the Agreed NUBL Principles. If a valid NUBL Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller in a timely manner, then the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement and the Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (i) the date the parties resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to all matters specified in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement and (ii) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the NUBL Arbitrator. 

   

 (iii) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a NUBL Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer have not reached agreement on all such matters, then the matters that remain in dispute shall be promptly submitted to an arbitrator (the " _NUBL Arbitrator_ ") for review and resolution. The NUBL Arbitrator shall be a nationally recognized actuarial firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties in writing, provided that the NUBL Arbitrator will not be an actuarial firm used by either Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. The procedures for the arbitration shall be determined by the NUBL Arbitrator. The NUBL Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute within 30 days following completion of the submissions to the NUBL Arbitrator. Any item not specifically referred to in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on Buyer and Seller in the manner set forth in the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement. The NUBL Arbitrator shall determine Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities based solely on presentations made by Seller and Buyer (and not by independent review). 

   

 (iv) The Non-Prevailing NUBL Party in any arbitration before the NUBL Arbitrator shall pay the fees and expenses of the NUBL Arbitrator. A party is the " _Non-Prevailing NUBL Party_ " if the NUBL Arbitrators determination of Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities is closer to the other partys determination of Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, as submitted to the NUBL Arbitrator, than it is to that partys determination of Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, as submitted to the NUBL Arbitrator. In resolving any matter specified in the NUBL Notice of Disagreement, the NUBL Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest amount for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest amount for such item claimed by either party. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) The term " _Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities_ " means, as of the Effective Time, the aggregate amount of the net unfunded benefit liabilities relating to the plans, agreements and arrangements set forth on the Reference Net Unfunded Benefits Liabilities Statement calculated using the same items as the Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities Statement and in accordance with the Agreed NUBL Principles. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the computation of Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities will be done in a manner consistent with methods used in the preparation of the Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, and the governing principle will be that the adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.4(b)_ can be appropriately measured only when the Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities and the Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities are computed on the same basis, using the Agreed NUBL Principles. 

   

 (c) _Purchase Price Adjustment  Settlement_. 

   

 (i) If Final Working Capital exceeds Reference Working Capital, the Purchase Price (but not the Preliminary Purchase Price) shall be increased by the amount by which Final Working Capital exceeds Reference Working Capital. If Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, the Purchase Price (but not the Preliminary Purchase Price) shall be reduced by the amount by which Reference Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital. 

   

 (ii) If Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities exceeds Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, the Purchase Price (but not the Preliminary Purchase Price) shall be reduced by the amount by which Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities exceeds Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities. If Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities exceeds Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, the Purchase Price (but not the Preliminary Purchase Price) shall be increased by the amount by which Reference Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities exceeds Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities. 

   

 (iii) The Purchase Price, as increased or decreased by the adjustments provided for in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.4(c)_, is referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_." 

   

 (iv) If the Preliminary Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Preliminary Purchase Price is more than the Final Purchase Price, Seller shall, within five business days after both the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement have become final and binding on the parties, make payment to the other party of the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon at the Agreed Rate, calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from the Closing Date through but excluding the payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if one but not both of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement or the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement has become final and binding on the parties, either party may elect to cause settlement of an adjustment to the Purchase Price in an amount consistent with the first sentence of this paragraph (iv) and pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)(i)_ or _2.4(c)(ii)_ , as applicable, within five business days after the Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement or the Cut-Off Date NUBL Statement, as the case may be, has become final and binding on the parties. Except in respect of an adjustment made pursuant to the 

   ##### 

  

   

immediately preceding sentence, this _Section 2.4_ shall remain applicable,
and the parties shall each comply, as to the determination of the Final
Working Capital or the Final Net Unfunded Benefit Liabilities, as the case
may be, including any resulting adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)(i)_ or _2.4(c)(ii)_ , as applicable. 

  

 Section 2.5 _Leased Department Agreements and Certain Other Agreements_. (a)  _Exhibit C_ sets forth each leased department agreement relating both to the Business and to other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to either amend the existing agreements and/or enter into new leased department agreements with the parties identified in _Exhibit C_ such that each partys rights and obligations relate exclusively to its own stores; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer and its Affiliates nor Seller and its Affiliates shall be required to make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to effect the foregoing. If such new leased department agreements are not in effect as of the Effective Time, the parties agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by Requirements of Law or any such applicable leased department agreement, to the extent related to the Business, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the obligations and liabilities of the Business arising under such agreement (but not such agreement itself), and Buyer shall receive the claims, rights and benefits of Seller and its Affiliates arising under such agreement or resulting therefrom (but not such agreement itself). Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the foregoing. 

   

 (a) _Exhibit D_ sets forth certain agreements relating both to the Business and to other businesses of Seller and its Affiliates. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals, consents and waivers to assign to Buyer that portion of such agreements (and any applicable schedules thereto) that relate exclusively to the stores of the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer and its Affiliates nor Seller and its Affiliates shall be required to make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any approval, consent or waiver. If, prior to the Closing, all necessary approvals, consents and waivers are not obtained with respect to any such agreement, then (to the maximum extent permitted by Requirements of Law or any such applicable agreement) to the extent related to the Business, Buyer shall be solely responsible for the obligations and liabilities of the Business arising under such agreement (but not such agreement itself), and Buyer shall receive the claims, rights and benefits of Seller and its Affiliates arising under such agreement or resulting therefrom (but not such agreement itself). Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to effect the foregoing. 

   

 Section 2.6 _Assignment of Certain Contracts_. (a) At the Closing, Seller agrees to, and to cause Sellers Affiliates to, assign, sell, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to acquire from Seller and its Affiliates, all of Sellers and its Affiliates right, title and interest as of the Effective Time in all Contracts which, although neither the Companies nor any of the Transferring Subsidiaries is the contracting party thereto, is in each case solely related to the Business (other than with respect to purchase orders, which shall be transferred to Buyer to the extent they relate to the Business), together with those Contracts set forth on  _Exhibit 2.6(a)_ hereto (collectively, the " _Assigned Contracts_ "). At the Closing, Buyer shall assume, and hereby agrees to pay, perform and observe fully and timely, effective as of the Effective Time, all liabilities and obligations relating to or arising out of the Assigned Contracts (collectively, the liabilities and obligations so assumed being referred to as the " _Assumed Contract Liabilities_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Assumed Contract Liabilities include any 

    ##### 

  

    

liabilities or obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money
incurred prior to the Closing Date (which shall not be deemed to include
capital leases) or any equity or equity-based awards relating to equity
securities of Seller. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary landlord consent to assign to one of the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries the Subject Lease Agreement and Buyer shall cooperate with the reasonable requests of Seller in obtaining such consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) neither Seller and its Affiliates nor Buyer and its Affiliates shall be required to make any payments or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain such landlord consent, (ii) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to make any proposal or request to assign the Subject Lease Agreement and (iii) no proposal or request to assign the Subject Lease Agreement shall be made by Buyer or any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Seller. If, prior to the Closing, the necessary landlord consent with respect to the Subject Lease Agreement has not been obtained (in a form (other than in respect of the amount of rent) reasonably acceptable to Buyer) or a court or other Governmental Body having jurisdiction over Seller shall have issued any order, decree or ruling that is then in effect and has the effect of restraining or prohibiting the assignment of the Subject Lease Agreement, then (v) all assets and liabilities of Seller, the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries solely related to the store (the " _Subject Store_ ") leased by Seller pursuant to the Subject Lease Agreement shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Subject Store shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement not to be included in the Business, (w) all customer lists and credit card customers who had more purchases at the Subject Store in the most recent month ended prior to the date hereof (determined by percentage of the total amount charged on the proprietary credit card bearing the Subject Stores trade name) than at any other location bearing the same trade name) shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (x) all employees located at the Subject Store shall not be deemed to be Business Employees, (y) all assets and liabilities solely related to the Subject Store shall be excluded from the calculations of Reference Working Capital and Final Working Capital and (z) the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Fixed Amount. If the landlords consent is obtained (in a form (other than in respect of the amount of rent) reasonably acceptable to Buyer) and no court or other Governmental Body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling that is then in effect and has the effect of restraining or prohibiting the assignment of the Subject Lease Agreement, then the Subject Lease Agreement shall be assigned to one of the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries prior to Closing. In such case, and if there is an increase in the rent to be paid to such landlord under the Subject Lease Agreement, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Variable Amount. Certain obligations of the parties contained in _Exhibit 2.6(b)(ii)_ with respect to the Subject Store are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later
than the Closing Date. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice of any material
breach by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Buyer becomes aware,

the Transferring Subsidiaries. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller,
the Companies, the Transferring Subsidiaries or any of their respective

 (b) Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to cease promptly, but in no event later than 180 days after the Cut-Off Date, using any (i) advertising or promotional materials and (ii) any stationery, business cards, business forms and other similar items owned by any of the Companies or any of the Transferring Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, in each case that contain anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names and Marks; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer shall cause each of the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries, when using items referred to in clause (ii) in the context of entering into or conducting contractual relationships, to make reasonably clear to all other applicable parties that Buyer, one of the Companies or one of the Transferring Subsidiaries, rather than Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries), is the party entering into or conducting the contractual relationship; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall ensure that personnel of the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries using such items shall not, and shall have no authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or agents of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to cease promptly, but in no event later than 180 days after the Closing Date, using any packaging materials owned by the Companies or the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date that contain anywhere thereon any of the Retained Names and Marks, unless such materials are changed to completely and permanently cover, delete or obliterate the Retained Names and Marks or anything confusingly similar thereto. 

   

 (d) The Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries shall have the right to exhaust all inventories of finished products owned or ordered by any of them as of the Cut-Off Date that contain as part of the physical products themselves ( _e.g._ , embroidered on a shirt or a label on a shirt, but not product packaging covered by clause (c) above) any of the Retained Names and Marks, provided that Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to use all commercially reasonable efforts to dispose of such finished products promptly after the Cut-Off Date. 

   

 (e) Other than as permitted under clauses (b) through (d) above, Buyer shall not and shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries not to use, without the prior written consent of Seller, any of the Retained Names and Marks (or anything confusingly similar thereto) in any manner whatsoever. 

   

 (f) At the Closing, Buyer will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to enter into a short-term trademark and trade name license agreement that grants 

    ##### 

  

    

Seller and Affiliates of Seller the right to use the Trademarks specified on
_Schedule 4.11(a)_ , other than those Trademarks that are the subject of the
Trademark License Agreement, in a manner substantially similar to the manner
in which Seller and Affiliates of Seller use such Trademarks as of the date
of this Agreement for a period of up to 180 days following the Cut-Off Date
(including the trade name for the Subject Store if the Subject Store is
excluded from the transaction, _provided_ _that_ , Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the trade name for such store
prior to such 180-day period). If the Subject Store is excluded from the
transactions contemplated hereby, in no event shall Seller have the right to
use any of the Trademarks specified in _Schedule 4.11(a)_ at the Subject
Store in connection with any "liquidation" or "going out of business sale,"
it being understood and agreed that Seller shall be entitled to conduct
clearance or other single store sales promotions. Except as provided in such
short-term trademark and trade name license agreement or the Trademark License
Agreement, Seller shall not, and Seller shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to use in any manner the names or marks of the Companies and the
Transferring Subsidiaries or any word that is confusingly similar in sound or
appearance to such names or marks. Seller agrees that in the event of any
actual or threatened violation of this paragraph (f), Buyer and each of its
Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may
have, to a temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final
injunctive relief against Seller or such Affiliate of Seller to prevent any
violations of this paragraph (f), without the necessity of posting a bond. 

   

 Section 7.2 _Tax Matters_. (a) _Liability for Taxes_. (i) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article X_ (and subject to the limitations thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member against any and all Taxes (A) imposed on any of the Companies or any Subsidiary pursuant to § 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations or similar provision of state, local or foreign law solely as a result of the Companies or such Subsidiary having been a member of the Seller Group, (B) imposed on any of the Companies or any Subsidiary, or for which any of the Companies or any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Cut-Off Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Cut-Off Date, (C) attributable to the Plan of Reorganization, (D) that are Section 338 Taxes, (E) imposed on any of the Companies or any Subsidiary as a result of any transaction (other than the transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement) occurring between the Cut-Off Date and the Closing that are not in the ordinary course of business or (F) imposed as a result of a disallowance, pursuant to a final determination, of Tax benefits claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 7.2(a)(v)_ or of 50% of Tax benefits claimed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the fifth sentence of _Section 7.3(a)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall not be liable for or pay, and does not agree to indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer Group Member from and against, (I) Taxes to the extent taken into account as a liability on the final Cut-Off Date Working Capital Statement and (II) property Taxes to the extent such Taxes are not due and payable prior to the Cut-Off Date (Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter " _Excluded Taxes_ "). Except for any real property tax refund attributable to the Business, Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_. 

    

 (ii) Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to _Article X_ (and subject to the limitations thereof) shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and against, (A) any and all Taxes imposed on any of the Companies or any 

   ##### 

  

   

Subsidiary, or for which any of the Companies or any Subsidiary may otherwise
be liable, for any taxable year or period that begins after the Cut-Off Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning immediately after the Cut-Off Date and (B) Excluded Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent provided in _Section 7.2(a)(i)_,
Seller shall be liable for Taxes specified in clauses (C), (D), (E) and (F)
thereof. Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for
which Buyer is liable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ and any real
property tax refund attributable to the Business. 

   

 (iii) For purposes of paragraphs _(a)(i)_ and _(a)(ii)_ , whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for (or refunds with respect to) Taxes of any of the Companies or a Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of such Company or Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Cut-Off Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Cut-Off Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Cut-Off Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Companies or such Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Companies or such Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Cut-Off Date, and by assuming that the Companies and the Subsidiaries ceased filing consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns with Sellers Group as of the close of the Cut-Off Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this paragraph shall cause Buyer to be liable for any Taxes specified in _Sections 7.2(a)(i)(C)_, _(D)_ , _(E)_ and _(F)_ , and  _provided_ , _further_ , however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years or periods on a daily basis. 

   

 (iv) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim, assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the Cut-Off Date in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Seller would otherwise be liable pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 7.2_ , and such change is reasonably expected based on reasonable assumptions to be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller to result in a decrease in the Tax liability of any of the Companies, any Subsidiary, Buyer or any Affiliate or successor of any thereof for any taxable year or period beginning after the Cut-Off Date or for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall not be liable pursuant to such paragraph (a) with respect to such increase to the extent of the present value of such decrease (as jointly determined by Buyer and Seller based on reasonable assumptions) (and, to the extent such increase in Tax liability is paid to a taxing authority by Seller or any Affiliate thereof, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the present value of such decrease). 

   

 (v) Buyer shall pay over to Seller and its Affiliates an amount equal to the Tax benefit, if any, available to Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, any of the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries), at such time such Tax benefit is or would be actually realized by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as a result of compensation (including any deduction for amounts treated as compensation under § 

   ##### 

  

   

1.83-7 of the Treasury Regulations) paid or payable by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (with a Seller Affiliate excluding, after the Effective Time, the
Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries) in cash, stock or other
property. In addition, Buyer shall pay to Seller and its Affiliates the
amount of any Tax benefit available to Buyer as a result of any retention
bonuses paid or payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (as described in 
_Section 7.3(b)_ hereof). The parties agree that such Tax benefit shall be
claimed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on its Tax Returns and the payment
to Seller with respect to such Tax Benefit shall be calculated assuming a
38.5% combined effective federal, state and local tax rate, and amounts owing
pursuant to the preceding sentence in respect of any retention bonus shall be
payable no later than 90 days after the date such bonus is paid. 

   

 (vi) Except as provided in the immediately following sentence, Buyer shall pay, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and against, (A) 50 percent of any and all real property transfer or gains Taxes, sales Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, stock transfer Taxes, or other similar Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") and (B) 100% of any and all Transfer Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by Section 3.11 of the Plan of Reorganization. Seller shall pay, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against (A) 50 percent of any and all Transfer Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) 100% of any and all Transfer Taxes imposed on the transactions contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization (other than Section 3.11 thereof) and (C) 100% of any and all incremental Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. 

  

 (b) _Tax Returns_. (i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) (I) all Income Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies and each Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date and Seller shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns; and (II) all non-Income Tax Returns with respect to the Companies and each Subsidiary that are due on or before the Cut-Off Date, and Seller shall remit, or cause to be remitted, any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns. Buyer (or Seller on Buyers behalf if and to the extent provided in the Buyer Transition Services Agreement) shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Companies and each Subsidiary and Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Seller, unless contrary to Requirements of Law or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns, in each case if doing so would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Tax liability of Buyer, the Companies, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof for any period after the Cut-Off Date. With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer that relate, in whole or in part, to Taxable periods ending prior to the Cut-Off Date or any Straddle Period (other than Tax Returns relating to property Taxes for which Buyer is wholly liable), (I) unless contrary to Requirements of Law or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken, election made, or method adopted that is inconsistent 

    ##### 

  

    

with positions taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in
filing such Tax Returns and (II) such Tax Returns shall be submitted to
Seller not later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days following the Cut-Off Date,
as promptly as practicable following the Cut-Off Date) for review and approval
by Seller, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, but
may in all cases be withheld or delayed in the sole discretion of Seller if
(A) such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause (I) of this
sentence or (B) such Tax Returns relate to a Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date. Seller or Buyer shall pay the other party for the Taxes for
which Seller or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this _Section 7.2_ but which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by
the other party pursuant to this paragraph (b) upon the written request of
the party entitled to payment, setting forth in reasonable detail the
computation of the amount owed by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, but in
no event shall such payment be requested earlier than 15 business days prior
to the due date for paying such Taxes. 

    

 (ii) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the Companies or any Subsidiary to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Companies or any Subsidiary with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Cut-Off Date without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller. None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall cause or permit the Companies or any Subsidiary to) amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Companies or any Subsidiary with respect to any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (other than such a Straddle Period relating to property Taxes for which Buyer is wholly liable), Sellers consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of Seller. 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall promptly cause each of the Companies and each Subsidiary to prepare and provide to Seller a package of Tax information materials, including, without limitation, schedules and work papers (the " _Tax Package_ ") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by it pursuant to paragraph (b)(i). The Tax Package shall be completed in accordance with past practice, including past practice as to providing such information and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant measure of income of each of the Companies and each Subsidiary. Buyer shall cause the Tax Package to be delivered to Seller within 60 days after the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) _Contest Provisions_. (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates, either of the Companies or any Subsidiary of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this _Section 7.2_.

   #####

 Section 7.3 _Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

   

 (a) _Offers of Employment_. Buyer will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to continue the employment effective immediately after the Cut-Off Date of all Business Employees, including each such employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of the Effective Time. Within ten business days prior to the Effective Time, Seller will provide to Buyer a list showing the names of each Business Employee then on leave of absence (and such list shall be updated as of the Cut-Off Date). The continued employment immediately following the Cut-Off Date of each Business Employee shall in each case provide at least the same base wages and annual base salary provided to each such 

    ##### 

  

    

employee on the Cut-Off Date for a period of at least one (1) year following
the Cut-Off Date. Buyer shall honor and be responsible for all obligations to
Business Employees with respect to performance bonuses in respect of the
fiscal year ending January 28, 2006 that become payable after the Cut-Off
Date and shall calculate such performance bonuses in accordance with Sellers
past practices (without any amendment or modification to the fiscal 2005
bonus plan in effect as of the end of the 2005 fiscal year); _provided_ ,
that Seller shall reimburse Buyer (within five business days following the
date on which Seller receives written notice specifying in reasonable detail
the amount paid with respect to such performance bonuses) on an after-tax
basis for 50% of all such performance bonuses that are paid by Buyer to such
Business Employees (assuming for these purposes a 38.5% combined effective
federal, state and local tax rate). The parties agree that the Tax benefit of
such bonus payments shall be claimed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on its
Tax Returns. The Business Employees who are employees of the Companies and
the Transferring Subsidiaries immediately following the Cut-Off Date are
referred to as " _Retained Employees_." Nothing in this _Section 7.3(a)_
shall obligate Buyer or the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to
continue the employment of any such Retained Employee for any specific period
(it being understood that Buyer, the Companies and the Transferring
Subsidiaries shall be obligated to pay severance benefits pursuant to
_Section 7.3(d)_). 

   

 (b) _Individual Employment Contracts_. As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to assume or retain, as the case may be, Sellers, the Companies or the Subsidiaries obligations under all Employment Agreements set forth on _Schedule 7.3(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and all of the obligations as the employer under such contracts and agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Buyer, the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries have any obligations under such Employment Agreements as in effect at the Effective Time relating to or arising out of equity-based compensation and Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless against any liabilities or obligations arising in respect thereof. Seller agrees to reimburse Buyer for the portion of those retention bonus payments payable after the Closing Date as provided in the retention bonus agreements table set forth at the end of _Schedule 4.18(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, it being understood that Buyer shall make such payments to the applicable Business Employees and shall comply with _Section 7.2(a)(v)_ in connection therewith. Seller will reimburse Buyer within five business days after receiving a written notice from Buyer that Buyer has paid such amounts. The payment from Seller to Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be treated by the parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Amounts owing by Seller may be net of amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(v)_. 

   

 (c) _Buyer s Employee Benefit Plans Generally_. As of the Effective Time and for a period of at least one (1) year thereafter, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to provide, each Retained Employee with employee benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided to such Retained Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (I) any employee benefits providing equity or equity-traded awards or (II) any defined benefit pension plan). After the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided in the following subsections of this _Section 7.3_, the following shall apply: 

    

 (i) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to continue, all Company Plans that are set forth in _Schedule 4.16(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (other than with respect to equity or 

   ##### 

  

   

equity-based awards); _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall (subject
to the terms thereof and any applicable Requirements of Law) have the right
to terminate any such Company Plans at any time after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ ,  _however_ , that Seller shall remain responsible
for all liabilities and obligations under the Carson Pirie Scott and Co.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan with respect to the individuals set
forth on _Schedule 7.3(c)(i)_. 

   

 (ii) As of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries or Buyers or the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries Pension Plans or Welfare Plans (collectively, " _Buyer s Plans_"), as applicable, to assume, all liabilities and obligations for benefits payable under each Seller Plan set forth on _Schedule 7.3(c)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to or with respect to (A) any Business Employee, including any employee on medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of the Cut-Off Date, (B) any former employee of the Business who on the date the individuals most recent termination of employment from Seller and all of the Affiliates of Seller occurred was engaged in the Business and (C) any dependent or former dependent of any such employee or former employee, including any dependent or former dependent entitled to COBRA coverage assumed by Buyer under _Section 7.3(h)_ (collectively, " _Covered Persons_ "). Such assumed liabilities include liabilities that relate to events occurring or expenses incurred at or prior to the Effective Time but that have not been paid as of the Effective Time, but only to the extent that the non-payment of such benefits is consistent with Sellers past practice regarding the time at which benefits are paid following the establishment of the liability to pay such benefits. In addition, with respect to such liabilities, Seller agrees to remit to Buyer any insurance proceeds actually received by Seller in respect thereof. Any such benefits related to events occurring or expenses incurred after the Effective Time shall be determined under the terms of Buyers Plans, except as provided to the contrary in the following subsections of this _Section 7.3_. 

   

 (iii) Buyer shall give, or cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to give, each Retained Employee credit under applicable Buyers Plans or personnel policies that cover the Retained Employee, including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to vacation, sick leave and severance benefits (excluding accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) for the Retained Employees service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Cut-Off Date, shall allow such Retained Employees to participate in the applicable Buyers Plan providing welfare benefits (including medical, life insurance, long-term disability insurance and long-term care insurance) without regard to preexisting-condition limitations under any Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately prior to the Cut-Off Date, and shall credit the Retained Employee with any expenses that were covered by the Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under Buyers Plans.

   ##### 

  

   

any documented expenses not paid for by Sellers insurance provider associated
with such extended hospital stay that are incurred after the Cut-Off Date. 

   

 (iv) No portion of the assets of any trust or other fund maintained by Seller for the purpose of paying benefits under any of the Seller Plans will be transferred to Buyer, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or any Buyers Plan.

Buyer and Seller agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be treated as if they were a "change of control" under the Severance Pay Plan. If any Business Employee identified in _Schedule 4.16(f)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as eligible to participate in the Severance Pay Plan as of the date of this Agreement becomes entitled to severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan pursuant to the "change of control" provisions thereunder (giving effect to the treatment of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a "change of control" under the Severance Pay Plan), Buyer will provide to such Business Employee the severance pay and other benefits provided under the Severance Pay Plan in lieu of any severance to which such Business Employee would be entitled under any Buyers Plans.

Buyer shall cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to continue to credit to each Retained Employee in accordance with the terms and conditions of Buyers Plans all vacation and personal holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Effective Time to the extent the relevant plan, policy or arrangement is set forth on _Schedule 4.16(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and shall assume all liability for the payment of such amounts to the extent accrued prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Seller vacation and personal holiday pay policies listed in _Schedule 4.16(e)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (f) _Disability Benefits and Leaves_. Buyer will, or will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to, assume all liabilities with respect to Covered Persons payable under any Seller Plan providing disability benefits, whether related to a disability that occurred before or after the Cut-Off Date. Except as provided in the previous sentence, (i) Seller and the Seller Plans shall retain the liability for all long-term disability benefits payable to any Covered Person under the terms of Sellers long-term disability plans after the Cut-Off Date with respect to any disability that occurred prior to the Cut-Off Date (but not with respect to any reoccurrence of such a disability after the Cut-Off Date), (ii) Buyer, the Companies, the Subsidiaries or a Buyers Plan shall assume the liability for all short-term disability benefits payable to any Retained Employee under any Seller Plan providing short-term disability benefits that are payable following the Cut-Off Date with respect to any disability that occurred prior to the Cut-Off Date (determined under the terms of the Seller Plan or personnel policy that applies to the disabled Retained Employee immediately prior to the Cut-Off Date) until the date, if any, on which the Retained Employee qualifies for long-term disability benefits under the Seller Plans, and (iii) Buyers Plans will govern the determination of what, if any, short-term and long-term disability benefits will be paid to any Retained Employee whose disability occurs after the Effective Time (or which reoccurs after the Effective Time). If any Retained Employee is on 

    ##### 

  

    

any form of leave of absence at the Effective Time (including any leave
subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or comparable state law),
Buyer shall reinstate, or shall cause the Companies or the Transferring
Subsidiaries to reinstate, such Retained Employee to active employment upon
the expiration of the leave to the extent such reinstatement is required by
any applicable law or regulation or by the Companies and the Subsidiaries
personnel policies and shall satisfy any other obligation with respect to

If Buyer provides such Buyers Plans to a Retained Employee following the Cut-Off Date, Buyer shall pay or shall cause the applicable Buyers Plan to assume and pay any such benefits or expenses that are incurred with respect to services performed for the Retained Employee or the Retained Employees dependents after the Effective Time. 

   

 (h) _COBRA Coverage_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Companies or the Transferring Subsidiaries to, assume and satisfy (or cause a Buyers Plan to satisfy) all entitlements under Code Section 4980B, Part 6 or 7 of Title I of ERISA, or any similar state law (collectively, " _COBRA_ ") with respect to any Company Plan or Seller Plan subject to COBRA of any Business Employee or former employee of the Business engaged in the Business at the time of termination of employment, or any dependent or former dependent of any such employee or former employee, whose qualifying event occurred prior to the Cut-Off Date at a time when the employee or former employee was on the payroll of the Companies or the Subsidiaries and engaged in the Business, (or whose qualifying event occurs at the Cut-Off Date as a result of the transactions covered by this Agreement), including any obligations to such individuals currently on such COBRA continuation coverage and any obligations to any such individual whose period for electing such COBRA continuation coverage has not yet expired.

As soon as reasonably practicable following the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall transfer assets to Buyers Flex Plan equal to the Aggregate Flex Plan Balances and Buyer, the Companies, the 

    ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries and Seller will treat the arrangement described in this _Section
7.3(i)_ as a spin-off of the applicable portions of the Seller Flex Plans and
a merger of such portions into Buyers Flex Plans.

 (ii) Buyer either currently maintains, or will establish or cause the Companies or the Subsidiaries to establish, not later than 90 days after the Cut-Off Date, one or more qualified defined contribution plans (" _Buyer s DC Plan_") that contain or will contain all provisions necessary for the acceptance of direct rollovers (in the form of cash and notes relating to plan participant loans) of "eligible rollover distributions" as defined in the Code and applicable regulations that Retained Employees are eligible to receive from the Sellers DC Plan without adversely affecting the qualified status of Sellers DC Plan. Buyers DC Plan will contain provisions to permit any such direct rollover to include the promissory note or notes representing any plan loans outstanding to the Retained Employee under Seller DC Plan on the date of the direct rollover, and Buyer, the Companies, the Subsidiaries and Seller will cooperate with each other to enable such direct rollovers to occur before such loans become defaulted. Seller agrees not to place any such loans in default for at least 90 days following the Cut-Off Date. 

  

 (k) _Workers  Compensation Liabilities_. As of the Effective Time, Buyer will cause the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries to assume (or reimburse Seller and the other Seller Affiliates for) all liabilities and obligations relating to compensation and benefits under any state workers compensation or similar law payable following the Effective Time to or with respect to any Retained Employee, or to any former employee of the Business, who in either case was employed by the Companies or the Subsidiaries on the date the claim arose or the incident on which the claim is based occurred.

    #####

 (ii) any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to perform, any of its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement (including its indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 7.2_); 

   

 (iii) any liability or obligation of any kind arising out of or relating to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters; 

   

 (iv) the Assumed Contract Liabilities; 

   

 (v) any obligation or liability of Seller or its Affiliates to the extent caused by Section 3.11 of the Plan of Reorganization; and 

   

 (vi) any liability or obligation of the Companies or the Subsidiaries arising out of or relating to the Business (other than those items for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification from Seller under _Section 10.1(a)_ without regard to any limitations on indemnification set forth in _Section 10.1(b)_ or the proviso to _Section 10.1(a)_ ). 

  

 (b) The indemnification provided for in _Section 10.2(a)_ shall terminate on March 31, 2007 (and no claims shall be made by any Seller Group Member under _Section 10.2(a)_ thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to: 

    

 (i) the covenants of Buyer set forth in _Sections 7.10_ and _12.6_ which shall survive for the periods of time set forth in such sections; 

   

 (ii) the covenants of Buyer set forth in _Sections 6.7_, _6.10_ ,  _7.1_ , _7.2_ , _7.3_ , _7.4_ , _7.5_ , _7.6_ , _7.7_ ,  _7.8_ , _7.9_ and _7.11_ which shall survive until the expiration of the relevant statutory period of limitations applicable to the underlying claim, giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof; 

   

 (iii) the obligations of Buyer pursuant to _Sections 10.2(a)(iii_),  _10.2(a)(iv)_ , _Section 10.2(a)(v)_ and _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_, which shall survive indefinitely; 

   

 (iv) the representations and warranties set forth in the first two (2) sentences of  _Section 5.2(a)_ and _Sections 5.6_ and _5.7_ , each of which shall survive until the expiration of the relevant statutory period of limitations applicable to the underlying claim, giving effect to waiver, mitigation or extension thereof; and 

   

 (v) any Losses or Expenses of which any Seller Group Member has validly given a Claim Notice to Buyer in accordance with the requirements of _Section 10.3_ on or prior to the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this _Section 10.2(b)_ , as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue solely with respect to the specific matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article X_, and Buyer shall have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Losses and Expenses that are payable with respect to such Claim Notice in accordance with this _Article X_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 10.3 _Notice of Claims_. Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give promptly to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced. 

   

 Section 10.4 _Determination of Amount_. (a) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any insurer). Each party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to make any such insurance recovery. Buyer and Seller agree that, for purposes of computing the amount of any indemnification payment under this _Article X_, any such indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes. If Seller is required to indemnify a Buyer Group Member pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.1_, and the cost, expense or liability for which the indemnification is sought under _Section 10.1_ has provided any Buyer Group Member with a Tax benefit actually saved or recovered, the amount of such Tax benefit that has been realized or received, after taking into consideration all costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax savings, shall reduce Sellers liability to indemnify a Buyer Group Member under _Section 10.1_. If Buyer is required to indemnify a Seller Group Member pursuant to the provisions of _Section 10.2_, and the cost, expense or liability for which the indemnification is sought under _Section 10.2_ has provided any Seller Group Member with a Tax benefit actually saved or recovered, the amount of such Tax benefit that has been realized or received, after taking into consideration all costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such Tax savings, shall reduce Buyers liability to indemnify a Seller Group Member under  _Section 10.2_. 

   

 (b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to _Section 10.3_, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this _Article X_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it. 

   

 Section 10.5 _Third Person Claims_. (a) Any party seeking indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within five business days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within 10 business days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be physically served with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the Indemnified Party 

    ##### 

  

    

shall notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within five business
days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor within seven
business days after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the third Person claim. The failure to give notice as provided in this 
_Section 10.5_ shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened or instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any Person in respect of which payment may be sought by one party hereto from the other party under the provisions of this _Article X_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall contain a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage indemnified against hereunder;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand or fails to acknowledge such Indemnitors obligations hereunder with respect to any such proceeding, claim or demand to the extent the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_, and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _that_ , if the Indemnitor wishes to settle any such proceeding which settlement involves only the payment of money and includes a full release of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party does not consent to such settlement, the Indemnitor shall not have any liability or obligation in excess of the proposed settlement amount. After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashiers check within 30 days after the date of such notice. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) To the extent of any inconsistency between this _Section 10.5_ and _Section 7.2(c_ ) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of _Section 7.2(c_) shall control with respect to Tax contests. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding any provisions of _Section 10.3_ or this _Section 10.5_ to the contrary, Seller hereby acknowledges its indemnification obligations under _Section 10.1(a)(vi)_ without regard to receipt of a Claim Notice or any other notices contemplated by  _Section 10.3_ or this _Section 10.5_ and hereby elects to continue to be represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with the matter set forth on _Schedule 10.1(a)(vi)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any proceeding, claim, or demand that relates thereto. 

   

 Section 10.6 _Limitations_. (a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has indemnified it pursuant to this _Article X_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter. 

   

 (b) In the event that Seller is conducting any defense against a third Person claim for which a Buyer Group Member has sought indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_, expenses incurred by Seller in connection therewith, including legal costs and expenses, shall constitute Expenses for purposes of determining the maximum aggregate amount to be paid by Seller pursuant to  _Section 10.1(a)_. 

   

 (c) EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF REVENUES OR PROFITS), EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of Seller to deliver any financial statements and other materials required by _Section 6.16(c)_ on or prior to the date on which such materials are required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 6.16(c)_ shall be deemed to be direct damages to Buyer in an amount that is equal to the additional interest that would be payable to holders of the then outstanding Notes if a Registration Default (as defined in the Commitment Letters) had first occurred on the date that Seller was obligated to deliver to Buyer such information and such Registration Default was cured on the date of delivery of such information; _provided_ , that the parties acknowledge and agree that Seller shall have no liability under _Section 6.16(c)_, unless Buyer has satisfied its obligations under  _Section 6.16(c)_. 

   

 (d) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and injunctive and provisional relief (including, but not limited to, specific performance), if the Closing occurs, this _Article X_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto for breaches of 

    ##### 

  

    

this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of the Securities contemplated
hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action of such party against the other party arising under this
Agreement or under any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement as a
matter of equity or under or based upon any federal, state, provincial, local
or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including those
relating to Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon common law
or otherwise, except that this _Section 10.6(d)_ shall not limit the
remedies of a party with respect to a claim based on fraud. 

   

 Section 10.7 _Mitigation_. Each of the parties agrees to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

 Section 12.6 _Access to Records after Closing_. (a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records of the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries which Buyer or any of its Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries prior to the Cut-Off Date.

 Section 12.7 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the parties hereto. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 12.8 _Interpretation_. Articles, titles and headings to sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The schedules and exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein. Disclosure of any fact or item in any schedule of the disclosure schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to each other Section or Subsection of this Agreement to 

    ##### 

  

    

the extent such disclosure is reasonably clear on its face that it would apply
to such other Section or Subsection. Neither the specification of any dollar
amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any schedule hereto is intended to imply
that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or
other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically
provides otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such item
or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course
of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement. Seller may, from time to time prior to or at
the Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
supplement, amend or create any schedule, in order to add information or
correct previously supplied information. No such amendment shall be evidence,
in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in
the corresponding section are no longer true and correct in all material
respects. It is specifically agreed that such schedules may be amended to add
immaterial, as well as material, items thereto. No such supplemental, amended
or additional schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach for purposes of
_Sections 8.3_ or _10.1(a)(i)_ unless Buyer gives written notice to
Seller stating that such supplemental, amended or additional schedule cures
such breach. No such supplemental, amended or additional schedule shall be
deemed to cure any breach for purposes of  _Sections 9.3_ or _10.2(a)(i)_
unless Seller gives written notice to Buyer stating that such supplemental,
amended or additional schedule cures such breach. 

   

 Section 12.9 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

   

 Section 12.10 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable. 

   

 Section 12.11 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when one or 

    ##### 

  

    

more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered
to Seller and Buyer. 

   

 Section 12.12 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing Date each party hereto shall take such other actions and execute such other documents and instruments of conveyance and transfer as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto from time to time to effectuate or confirm the transfer of the Securities to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, on and after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including for purposes of this _Section 12.12_, the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer to Seller and its Affiliates (i) any assets of the Companies and the Transferring Subsidiaries that do not primarily arise out of or relate to the Business, (ii) any assets relating primarily to the operation of the Parisian stores or the Club Libby Lu business, (iii) assets that are used by Seller to perform its obligations under the Private Brands Agreement, (iv) assets that are used by Seller to perform its obligations under the Buyer Transition Services Agreement and (v) all Contracts that relate to businesses of Seller other than the Business (except for the Assigned Contracts).
