consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U>, if the

is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to
whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is

otherwise, neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty

create any schedule, in order to add information or correct previously supplied information. No
such amendment shall be evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in the

agreed that such schedules may be amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items thereto.
