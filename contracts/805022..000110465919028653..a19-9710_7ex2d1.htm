ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger_

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DLLCA and the DRULPA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Partnership, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease, and the Partnership shall continue its existence as a limited
partnership under the DRULPA as the surviving entity in the Merger. The
Partnership, as the surviving entity after the Merger, is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Surviving Entity_ ".

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the fifth business day
following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent such waiver is permitted
by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New
York 10019, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Partnership; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to consummate the Closing if the Marketing
Period has not ended at least five business days prior to the time that the
Closing would otherwise have occurred, in which case the Closing shall not
occur until the earlier to occur of (a) a date before or during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on at least three business days prior written
notice to the Partnership and (b) the fifth business day immediately following
the final day of the Marketing Period, subject to, in each case, the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time),
unless another date or time is agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Partnership. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as
the " _Closing Date_."

 



     

 

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger executed in
accordance with, and in such form as is required by, the relevant provisions
of the DLLCA and the DRULPA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), and shall make
all other filings, recordings or publications required under the DLLCA and the
DRULPA in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the
time that the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ") or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, at such later time as is agreed to by the parties
hereto prior to the filing of such Certificate of Merger and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective is
herein referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the applicable provisions of
the DLLCA and the DRULPA.

 



 

SECTION 1.05. _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity._ At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Limited Partnership and the Partnership
Agreement of the Partnership, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, will remain unchanged and shall be the certificate of limited
partnership and agreement of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (and subject to
Section 5.07 hereof).

 



 

SECTION 1.06. _Admission as Partner._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger, and in accordance with this Agreement, the Partnership Agreement and
the DRULPA (including Section 17-301(b)(3)), (a) Parent shall be admitted as
the sole limited partner of the Partnership and will hold all limited partner
interests in the Partnership and, simultaneously therewith, all limited
partners of the Partnership immediately prior to the Merger shall cease to be
limited partners of the Partnership ( _provided_ , that if Parent makes the
ServiceCo Election, then ServiceCo shall remain a limited partner of the
Partnership and continue to hold the ServiceCo Units), (b) the General Partner
shall continue as the sole general partner of the Partnership, (c) the
Partnership shall continue without dissolution and (d) the books and records
of the Partnership shall be revised to reflect the foregoing.

 



 

SECTION 1.07. _Tax Treatment._ Parent and the Partnership agree that the
Merger shall be treated solely for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a sale
of all of the Partnership Units by the holders thereof in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and a purchase of all of the assets of the Partnership by
Parent, in accordance with IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, Situation
2. Parent and the Partnership shall prepare and file all applicable Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with such treatment and shall not take any
position that is inconsistent with such treatment, except as required by
applicable Law following a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other final decision by an applicable Governmental Authority.

 



     

 

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Equity Interests; Exchange of Certificates; 
Equity-Based Awards_

 



 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Equity Interests._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Partnership, the
General Partner, Parent, Merger Sub or the holder of any securities of the
Partnership or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Equity of Merger Sub._ All of the limited liability company interests in
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become a number of Partnership Units equal to the
number of Partnership Units converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement, which shall constitute 100% of the limited partner
interests in the Surviving Entity ( _provided_ , that if Parent makes the
ServiceCo Election, then ServiceCo shall remain a limited partner of the
Partnership and continue to hold the ServiceCo Units).

 



 

(b) _Cancelation of Certain Units._ Subject to Section 2.01(e), all
Partnership Units that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(i) the Partnership or (ii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall in each
case be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration._ Each issued and outstanding Partnership Unit
(other than Partnership Units to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(b) or, upon a ServiceCo Election, the ServiceCo Units) shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to $41.50 per unit, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Partnership Units shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such Partnership Unit (each, a " _Certificate_
") or of non-certificated Partnership Units held in book entry form (each, an
" _Uncertificated Unit_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Article II.

 



 

(d) _General Partner Interest._ The general partner interest in the
Partnership issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain outstanding in the Surviving Entity in the form set forth in the
Partnership Agreement, and the General Partner, as the holder of such general
partner interest, shall continue as the sole general partner of the Surviving
Entity as set forth in the Partnership Agreement.

 



 

(e) _ServiceCo Units._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Parent in its sole discretion may elect, prior to Closing, to cause
ServiceCo to continue to hold the Partnership Units held by ServiceCo as of
the Effective Time (the " _ServiceCo Units_ ") and to thereby remain a limited
partner of the Partnership, in each case at and after Closing (such election
by Parent, the " _ServiceCo Election_ ") if (x) the Trustee Approval, to the
extent required, has been obtained prior to the Closing and (y) at or prior to
the Effective Time, ServiceCo has become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
in accordance with the terms hereof. Unless otherwise directed by Parent
pursuant to _Section 5.16_, if Parent has made the ServiceCo Election, the
parties agree that the following steps will be taken in the sequence set forth
below

 



     

 

 



 

and immediately prior to the Closing, and that the parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts prior to the Closing to facilitate and
enable the following steps to be taken immediately prior to Closing:

 



 

(i) _first,_ Parent, ServiceCo and the Trustee, on behalf of the ESOP, will
consummate the acquisition transaction contemplated by the ServiceCo Purchase
Agreement in accordance therewith;

 



 

(ii) _second_ , ServiceCo will, and Parent will cause ServiceCo to, at the
election of Parent or as may be agreed by Parent and ServiceCo, either
distribute or sell all of its Partnership Units to Parent;

 



 

(iii) _third_ , Parent will cause ServiceCo to merge with and into a newly
formed limited liability company that is wholly owned by Parent (" _New LLC_
") in a merger in which Parent receives additional membership interests in New
LLC in exchange for the outstanding common stock of ServiceCo or ServiceCo
will convert to a limited liability company; and

 



 

(iv) _fourth_ , the Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

 



 

Parent may waive the performance of one or both of the foregoing steps (ii)
and (iii) in its sole discretion and may establish and effect a different set
of one or more steps between step (i) and step (iv) to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.01(e) and Section 5.16.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates and Uncertificated Units._ (a)
_Paying Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to act as agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II and, in connection therewith, prior to the Closing Date
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Partnership. At or immediately after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent an amount
in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Pending its disbursement
in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of
the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, as promptly
as reasonably practicable, replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith. No investment losses
resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall
diminish the rights of any holder of Partnership Units to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided herein. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid promptly to Parent.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five business days thereafter),
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Certificates
(other than Certificates representing (x) Partnership Units to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b) or (y) upon the ServiceCo Election, the
ServiceCo Units) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
which shall be in such form and shall have such other customary provisions as
Parent and the Partnership may reasonably agree prior to the Closing Date) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
2.01(c). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with such letters instructions (and such other customary
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent), the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Partnership Unit formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Entity
or the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Partnership Units._ The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of Partnership Units in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Partnership Units previously
represented by the relevant Certificates or Uncertificated Units, and at the
Effective Time, the transfer books of the Partnership shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of the Partnership Units that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that represented ownership of Partnership Units
and Uncertificated Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Partnership Units, except
as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon (i) the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, (ii) compliance with the other procedures set forth in this Article
II, and (iii) if required by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in

 



     

 

 



 

exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of Partnership Units formerly represented
by such Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) which has not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Units, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Entity for, and
the Surviving Entity shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of
this Article II. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of
Partnership Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(g) _Withholding._ Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Article II such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(h) _Uncertificated Units._ As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than five business days thereafter),
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to (i) mail to
each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of Uncertificated Units
(other than (x) Uncertificated Units to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(b) or (y) upon the ServiceCo Election, the ServiceCo Units) materials
advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of
its Uncertificated Units into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
and (ii) subject to the delivery of such customary documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, pay to each Person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of Uncertificated Units the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive in respect of its Uncertificated Units pursuant
to Section 2.01(c) and this Article II. If payment of the Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any
Uncertificated Units are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Uncertificated Units and shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent that such Uncertificated Units were properly transferred and that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

The Partnership and the General Partner each jointly and severally represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as (A) set forth in the
confidential disclosure letter delivered by the Partnership to Parent and
Merger Sub concurrently with or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Partnership Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood that any
information, item or matter set forth on one section or subsection of the
Partnership Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to, and
shall be deemed to apply to and qualify, the section or subsection of this
Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such information, item or matter is relevant
to such other section or subsection) or (B) disclosed in any report, schedule,
form, statement or other document (including exhibits) filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by the Partnership on or after January 1, 2017 and
publicly available no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, one business
day prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Filed Partnership SEC
Documents_ "), other than any risk factor disclosure (other than any
statements of fact or other statements that are not forward looking and
cautionary in nature) in any such Filed Partnership SEC Document contained in
the "Risk Factors" section thereof or other similarly cautionary, forward
looking or predictive statements in such Filed Partnership SEC Documents (it
being acknowledged and agreed that nothing disclosed in the Filed Partnership
SEC Documents will be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.02(a) and the first sentence of Section
3.02(b)):

 



 

SECTION 3.01. _Organization; Standing._ (a) The Partnership is a limited
partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite partnership power and
authority necessary to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except (other than with respect to the Partnerships due organization and
valid existence) as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of the Partnership
Organizational Documents are included in the Filed Partnership SEC Documents
and, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Partnership and the General
Partner are not in violation of any of the provisions thereof.

 



 

(b) Each of the Partnerships Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has
all requisite corporate, partnership, limited liability company or other
entity power and authority, as applicable, necessary to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business
and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable
Law) in each jurisdiction in

 



     

 

 



 

which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except (other than with respect to the due
organization and valid existence of the General Partner) where the failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing, have such power and authority
or be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership has
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the organizational or
governing documents of each of the Partnerships Significant Subsidiaries,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, none of the Partnerships Significant Subsidiaries are in
violation of any of the provisions thereof.

 



 

SECTION 3.02. _Capitalization._ (a) At the close of business on May 7, 2019
(the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 153,918,086 Partnership Units were issued
and outstanding, (ii) 1,533,833 Partnership Units were reserved and available
for issuance pursuant to the Partnership Equity Plans, (iii) no Partnership
Units were subject to Partnership Unit Options, (iv) 829,332 Partnership Units

partner of the Partnership, owning the entire outstanding general partner
interest in the Partnership. The Partnership owns beneficially and of record
all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of, and is the sole
member of, the General Partner. Since the Capitalization Date through the date
hereof, neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has (1) issued any
Partnership Securities or incurred any obligation to make any payments based
on the price or value of any Partnership Securities or (2) established a
record date for, declared, set aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or
made any other distribution in respect of, any Partnership Securities, other
than, in each case, pursuant to the vesting, settlement or exercise of
Partnership Equity Awards, payments with respect to Partnership DERs in
respect of Partnership Equity Awards or the forfeiture or withholding of taxes
with respect to Partnership Equity Awards. All of the outstanding Partnership
Phantom Units have been issued pursuant to the Buckeye Partners, L.P. 2013

collectively as

 



     

 

 



 

" _Partnership Securities_ ") and (v) no other obligations by the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of
any Partnership Securities. There are no outstanding agreements of any kind
which obligate the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any Partnership Securities (other than pursuant to
the forfeiture or withholding of taxes with respect to Partnership Equity
Awards), or obligate the Partnership to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreements relating to any Partnership Securities, including any agreements
granting any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights,
rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any Partnership
Securities. No direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Partnership owns any
Partnership Units. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the holders of Partnership Units on any matter. None of
the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership is a party to any
unitholders agreement, voting trust agreement, registration rights agreement
or other similar agreement or understanding relating to any Partnership
Securities or any other agreement relating to the disposition, voting or
dividends with respect to any Partnership Securities. All outstanding
Partnership Units and the general partner interest in the Partnership held by
the General Partner have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid (to the extent required under the Partnership Agreement), nonassessable
(except as such nonassessability may be affected by matters described in
Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA) and free of preemptive
rights.

 



 

(c) Section 3.02(c)(i) of the Partnership Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
the date hereof, the name of each of the Partnerships Significant
Subsidiaries, the state or jurisdiction of its organization (and each direct
owner of its outstanding equity interests). All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, each Significant
Subsidiary of the Partnership (except for directors qualifying shares or the
like, in each case, set forth in Section 3.02(c)(ii) of the Partnership
Disclosure Letter) are owned directly or indirectly, beneficially and of
record, by the Partnership free and clear of all Liens and transfer
restrictions, except for Permitted Liens and such Liens and transfer
restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the " _Securities Act_ ") or other applicable securities Laws
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such shares of capital stock or other equity or voting interests). Each
outstanding share of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary of the
Partnership, which is held, directly or indirectly, by the Partnership, is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid (with respect to any Significant
Subsidiaries that are limited liability companies or limited partnerships, to
the extent required under the limited liability company agreement or limited
partnership agreement of the applicable Significant Subsidiary), nonassessable
(with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries that are limited liability
companies or limited partnerships, except as such nonassessability may be

17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the limited liability company agreement or
limited partnership agreement of the applicable Significant Subsidiary) and
free of preemptive rights, and there are no subscriptions, options, warrants,
rights, calls, contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or
arrangements relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or

or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any
agreements granting any preemptive rights, subscription rights,

to any securities of any Significant Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock or other equity or voting securities or equity
or voting interests, or has any interest convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable therefor, in any Person other than the Partnerships
Subsidiaries.

the General Partner and ServiceCo, enforceable against each of the
Partnership, the General Partner and ServiceCo, respectively, in accordance
with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and

Partnership has timely filed or furnished with the SEC all material reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed or
furnished by the Partnership with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act since January 1, 2017 (collectively, the " _Partnership SEC
Reports_ "). As of their respective effective dates (in the case of
Partnership SEC Reports that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates or, if amended prior to the date hereof, the date of the filing of such
amendment, with respect to the portions that are amended (in the case of all
other Partnership SEC Reports), the Partnership SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the NYSE,
in each case, as applicable to such Partnership SEC Reports, and none of the
Partnership SEC Reports as of such respective dates (or, if amended prior to
the date hereof, the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the
disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the Partnerships Subsidiaries or the General Partner
is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act. As of the date hereof, there are not any material outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC or its staff that
are not set forth or reflected in the Partnership SEC Reports, and the
Partnership has not received written notice from the SEC that any of the
Partnership SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The audited annual consolidated financial statements and the unaudited
quarterly consolidated financial statements of the Partnership (including all
related notes or schedules) included or incorporated by reference in the
Partnership SEC Reports, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC
(or, if such Partnership SEC Reports were amended prior to the date hereof,
the date of the filing of such amendment, with respect to the consolidated
financial statements that are amended or restated therein), complied as to
form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other rules and regulations of the
SEC) applied in all material respects on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except (i) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (ii) as
permitted by Regulation S-X) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Partnership and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations, cash flows and changes in partners capital for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except
liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against in the consolidated balance
sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Partnership as of December 31, 2018 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ ") included in the Partnership SEC Reports prior to the
date hereof, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, (iii) as contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise incurred in connection with the Transactions, or (iv)
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) The Partnership has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act,
which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information
relating to the Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries required to be
included in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Partnerships filings with the SEC to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Since January 1, 2017, neither the
Partnership nor, to the Partnerships Knowledge, the Partnerships independent
registered public accounting firm, has identified or been made aware of (A)
any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the
Partnerships internal controls over financial reporting which would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Partnerships ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, in each case which has
not been subsequently remediated or (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Partnerships internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) The General Partners principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the Partnership SEC Reports, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of the Partnership has completed its

 



     

 

 



 

assessment of the effectiveness of the Partnerships internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the
Partnership, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent the General Partners principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due. The Partnership is in compliance in all material respects with all
effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2017, there
have been no material written complaints (and, to the Knowledge of the
Partnership, no other material complaints) from or to a Governmental Authority
regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing practices of
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any Contract to become a party to, any off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among the Partnership and any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Partnership in the Partnerships published financial statements or any
Partnership SEC Reports.

 



 

(g) The Proxy Statement (including any amendment or supplement thereto), at
the time filed with the SEC and at the time first sent or given to the
unitholders of the Partnership and at the time of the Partnership Unitholders
Meeting, will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Partnership makes no representation or warranty with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

SECTION 3.06. _Absence of Certain Changes._ Since the Balance Sheet Date

enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent and Merger Sub, as
applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and (z) in full force and effect. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party under the Equity Financing Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter that would result in the Financing contemplated thereby to
be unavailable or materially delayed. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that Parent or Merger Sub or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other parties to the Financing Letters will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Letters
required to be satisfied by them, that the conditions thereof will not
otherwise be satisfied or that the full amount of the Financing will not be
available on the Closing Date. Except as expressly set forth in the Financing
Letters, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Fund and
the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
other Contracts, arrangements or understandings (other than any fee letters,
true and complete copies of which (except for fee, "market flex" and other
economic terms which are customarily redacted in transactions of this type)
have been provided to the Partnership) to which Parent or Merger Sub or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the Fund is a party related to the Financing that
would permit the Fund or the lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter to
reduce the total amount of the Financing, or that would adversely affect the
availability of the Financing.

 



 

SECTION 4.06. _Certain Arrangements._ As of the date hereof, there are no
Contracts or commitments to enter into Contracts (a) between Parent, Merger
Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective Affiliates, on the
one hand, and any member of the Partnerships management or the Partnership
Board or any beneficial owner of Partnership Units, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Transactions (including as to continuing employment
or equity roll-over) or (b) pursuant to which any unitholder of the
Partnership would be entitled to receive value or consideration of a different
amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any
unitholder of the Partnership agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against or otherwise oppose any Superior Proposal.

 



 

SECTION 4.07. _Brokers and Other Advisors._ No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,

upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent,

SECTION 4.08. _No Other Partnership Representations or Warranties._ Parent
and Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received

assets of the Partnership which it and its Representatives have desired or
requested to review, and that it and its Representatives have had full
opportunity to meet with the management of the Partnership and to discuss the
business and assets of the Partnership. Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that (a) except for the representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement, (i) neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any other Person, have made or is making, and none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Fund or any other Person is relying upon, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with
respect to any oral, written, video, electronic or other information provided
or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives or any oral, written, video, electronic or other information
developed by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
(including with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof) and (ii)
neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other Person,
will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to
Parent or Merger Sub resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
(in any form whatsoever and through any medium whatsoever), or the use by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives, of any
information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other forward-
looking information, business plans or other material developed by or provided
or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives, including in due diligence materials, "data rooms" or
management presentations (formal or informal, in person, by phone, through
video or in any other format), in anticipation or contemplation of any of the
Transactions, and (b) (i) in connection with the due diligence investigation
of the Partnership by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have
received and may continue to receive from the Partnership certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business and strategic plan information, regarding the Partnership and
its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations, (ii) there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business

Parent and Merger Sub have not relied on such information (including with
respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof) and will have no claim
against the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, with respect thereto or, except for the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement, any rights hereunder with respect
thereto.

 



 

SECTION 4.09. _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) will, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC and at the time first sent or
given to the unitholders of the Partnership or at the time of the Partnership
Unitholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of

 



     

 

 



 

the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no representation or warranty with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Partnership or any Affiliates
thereof for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

SECTION 4.10. _Legal Proceedings._ Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially
impair (a) the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of any of the Transactions
on a timely basis or (b) the compliance by Parent or Merger Sub with its
obligations under this Agreement, there is no (i) pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened Action against Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, pending or threatened Action against any of their respective
Affiliates, or (ii) Judgment imposed upon or affecting Parent or Merger Sub
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective Affiliates, in each
case, by or before any Governmental Authority.

or Merger Sub own any Partnership Units.

 



 

SECTION 4.12. _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Partnership a Limited Guarantee of the
Fund in favor of the Partnership, which, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, guarantees certain of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement as set forth therein. The Limited Guarantee is duly authorized,
valid and in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Fund, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. As of
the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the
Fund under the Limited Guarantee.

determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to so waive would be inconsistent with the Partnership Boards or
the applicable committees contractual obligations under the Partnership
Agreement or obligations under applicable Law that are applicable to the
Partnership Board or the applicable committee, to the extent not waived or
otherwise modified or eliminated.

 



 

(c) The Partnership shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in writing in the event that any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover
Proposal is received by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or its or
their Representatives and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and
conditions of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry, proposal or offer (and shall include with such notice unredacted
copies of such Takeover Proposal and copies of any other documents evidencing
or specifying the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal or, if not in
writing, a written description of the material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal), and the Partnership shall promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) keep Parent reasonably informed of any material developments
with respect to any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer
(including copies of any additional written materials received by the
Partnership, its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives). For the
avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.02(c) will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) Neither the Partnership Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), the Partnership Board Recommendation or fail to make the
Partnership Board Recommendation when otherwise required pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement, or take any public action or make any public statement
inconsistent with the Partnership Board Recommendation (it being understood
that a customary "stop, look and listen" communication to the holders of
Partnership Units pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with the Partnership Board
Recommendation), (B) recommend, endorse, approve or adopt, or publicly propose
to recommend, endorse, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to
include the Partnership Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) make
any public recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
that is subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act other than a
recommendation in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
against such tender offer or exchange offer or (E) if a Takeover Proposal
(other than a Takeover Proposal subject to Regulation 14D) shall have been
publicly announced or disclosed, fail to recommend against such Takeover
Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Partnership Board Recommendation on or prior
to the earlier of ten business days after Parent requests such reaffirmation
or five business days prior to the Partnership Unitholders Meeting (any
action described in this clause (i), being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) execute or enter into (or cause or permit
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into) any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, exchange
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, collaboration
agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement providing for, relating
to, or in connection with, a Takeover Proposal, other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, a " _Partnership Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to, but not after, obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, the
Partnership Board or any committee thereof may, in response to a Takeover
Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 5.02 and that has been
made and not withdrawn, (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii)
cause the Partnership to enter into a Partnership Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Takeover Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(ii), in either case, if the Partnership Board or any committee
thereof has determined in good faith, (A) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Partnership Boards or the applicable committees contractual obligations
under the Partnership Agreement or obligations under applicable Law that are
applicable to the Partnership Board or the applicable committee, to the extent
not waived or otherwise modified or eliminated and (B) after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership
Board or any committee thereof shall not, and shall cause the Partnership not
to, take any action set forth in clause (i) or clause (ii), unless (1) the
Partnership has given Parent at least four business days prior written notice
of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the identity
of the party making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof (including the per Partnership Unit value of the
consideration offered therein), and shall include an unredacted copy of the
proposed Partnership Acquisition Agreement (if any) with the Person making
such Superior Proposal and unredacted copies of any other material documents

 



     

 

 



 

evidencing or specifying the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(the four business days following such written notice, the " _Superior
Proposal Match Period_ "), (2) the Partnership has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the
Superior Proposal Match Period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to
enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the
Financing Letters (or either of them) and the Limited Guarantee, as
applicable, such that it would cause such Takeover Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (3) following the end of the Superior
Proposal Match Period, the Partnership Board or any committee thereof shall
have considered in good faith such revised terms, and shall have determined
(x) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Takeover Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
if the revisions proposed by Parent in such revised terms were to be given
effect and (y) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Partnership Boards
or the applicable committees contractual obligations under the Partnership
Agreement or obligations under applicable Law that are applicable to the
Partnership Board or the applicable committee, to the extent not waived or
otherwise modified or eliminated (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a new Superior Proposal Match Period,
which Superior Proposal Match Period shall be three business days with respect
to any such amendment).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
prior to, but not after, obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, the
Partnership Board or any committee thereof may, in response to an Intervening
Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Partnership Board or any
committee thereof has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change would be inconsistent with the Partnership Boards or the applicable
committees contractual obligations under the Partnership Agreement or
obligations under applicable Law that are applicable to the Partnership Board
or the applicable committee, to the extent not waived or otherwise modified or
eliminated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership Board or any
committee thereof shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event unless (i) the Partnership has given Parent at least
four business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the material facts underlying
the Partnership Boards determination that an Intervening Event has occurred
and the reasons for such Adverse Recommendation Change) (the four business
days following such written notice, the " _Intervening Event Match Period_ "),
(ii) the Partnership has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during the Intervening Event Match
Period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the financing letters and the
Limited Guarantee, as applicable, so as to obviate the need to effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change on the basis of such Intervening Event so that
the Transactions may be effected and (iii) following the end of the
Intervening Event Match Period, the Partnership Board or any committee thereof
shall have considered in good faith such revised terms, and shall have
determined after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Partnership Boards or the
applicable committees contractual obligations under the Partnership Agreement
or obligations under applicable Law that are applicable to the Partnership
Board or the applicable committee, to the extent not waived or otherwise
modified or eliminated (it being understood and agreed that any material
development

 



     

 

 



 

with respect to an Intervening Event shall require a new notice and a new
Intervening Event Match Period, which Intervening Event Match Period shall be
three business days with respect to any such material development).

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Partnership or the Partnership Board or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to the unitholders of the Partnership a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
unitholders of the Partnership that is required by applicable Law or if the
Partnership Board or any committee thereof determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Partnerships outside legal counsel, that the failure of
the Partnership Board or any committee thereof to make such disclosure would
be inconsistent with the Partnership Boards or the applicable committees
contractual obligations under the Partnership Agreement or obligations under
applicable Law that are applicable to the Partnership Board or the applicable
committee, to the extent not waived or otherwise modified or eliminated,
_provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 5.02(g) shall not be deemed to
permit the Partnership or the Partnership Board or any committee thereof to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with Section
5.02(e) or (f); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other
than (A) a customary "stop, look and listen" communication to the holders of
Partnership Units pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act, (B) an express rejection of any applicable Takeover Proposal or (C) an
express reaffirmation of the Partnership Board Recommendation, in each case,
shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change to the extent such
disclosure contains or constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change in
accordance with Section 5.02(d).

 



 

(h) Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.02 by any of the Partnerships or the
General Partners Subsidiaries, or any of the Partnerships, the General
Partners or the Partnerships Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.02 by the Partnership and the General
Partner.

 



 

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means any confidentiality agreement entered into by the Partnership that (x)
contains confidentiality provisions that are not less favorable in any
material respect to the Partnership than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
include explicit or implicit standstill provisions or otherwise restrict the
making of or amendment or modification to Takeover Proposals and (y) expressly
permits the Partnership to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry,
proposal or offer from any Person or group (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition of 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the
Partnership Board or any committee thereof), including through the acquisition
of one or more Subsidiaries of the Partnership owning such assets, (ii)
acquisition of beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of the general partner interest of the Partnership or 15% or more
of the outstanding Partnership Units, (iii) acquisition of a business or
businesses that constitute 15% or

 



     

 

 



 

more of the cash flow, net revenues or net income of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially owning 15% or
more of the outstanding Partnership Units, (v) merger, division,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Partnership
pursuant to which such Person or group (or the equityholders of any Person)
would acquire, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the consolidated assets
of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Partnership Board or any committee
thereof) or 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Partnership or of
the surviving entity in a merger, division, consolidation, share exchange or
other business combination involving the Partnership or the resulting direct
or indirect parent of the Partnership or such surviving entity, or (vi)
issuance or sale or other disposition (including by way of merger, division,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or other
similar transaction) of 15% or more of the outstanding Partnership Units;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this Agreement and the Transactions shall not be
deemed a Takeover Proposal.

 



 

(k) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date of this
Agreement that the Partnership Board or any committee thereof has determined
in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, (i) would be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the Partnerships unitholders than the Merger Transactions and (ii) is
reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms (if
accepted), taking into account such legal, regulatory, financial, financing
and other aspects (including certainty of closing and, to the extent third-
party financing is required, that such financing is then fully committed on
customary terms and conditions) of such proposal and the Person making such
proposal and of this Agreement as the Partnership Board or any committee
thereof deems relevant; _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of
"Superior Proposal", the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%".

 



 

(l) As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean any effect,
change, event, fact, condition, development or occurrence that is material to
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that (i) first becomes
known after the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the Partnership
Unitholder Approval and (ii) was not known by or reasonably foreseeable to the
Partnership Board as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any of the following effects, changes, events, facts,
conditions, developments or occurrences be taken into account in determining
whether an Intervening Event has occurred: (A) the receipt, existence or terms
of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or direct or indirect
consequence thereof; (B) any effect, change, event, fact, condition,
development or occurrence generally affecting (1) the petroleum industry
generally or the midstream petroleum logistics and/or blending industries
specifically (including the terminaling, storage, processing and marketing
industries), including regulatory conditions (or changes therein) or any other
industry in which the Partnership and its Subsidiaries operate, or (2) the
economy, credit, financial, capital or commodities markets in the United
States, the Caribbean or elsewhere in the world, including changes in interest
or currency exchange rates; or (C) the fact that, in and of itself, the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries exceeds any internal or published
projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions in respect of revenues,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending after
the date of this Agreement, or changes or prospective changes

 



     

 

 



 

in the market price or trading volume of the Partnership Units on the NYSE (it
being understood that the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to such
events may be taken into account in determining whether there has been an
Intervening Event if such facts are not otherwise excluded under this
definition).

 



 

SECTION 5.03. _Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including Section 5.03(e) below, each of the parties hereto shall
cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts (unless, with
respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided
for in this Agreement) to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do,
or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly
as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make effective as promptly as
reasonably practicable the Transactions, including preparing and filing as
promptly as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications and other documents, (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions, (iv) in the
event of a change in U.S. federal income tax law, provide additional factual
representations and information reasonably requested in connection with
satisfying the condition in Section 6.02(c), and (v) defend or contest in good
faith any Action brought by a third party that could otherwise prevent or
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay in any material respect the
consummation of the Transactions, in the case of each of clauses (i) through
(v), other than with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents,
approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations relating to Antitrust Laws, the DPA, the Communications Act or
the Other Regulatory Approvals, which are dealt with in Sections 5.03(c) and
(d) below. For purposes hereof, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act,
the Clayton Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, all applicable
foreign antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Partnership and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within

 



     

 

 



 

15 business days following the date hereof, (ii) submit, or cause to be
submitted, a draft joint voluntary notice to CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. §
800.401(f) with respect to the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement and make, or cause to be
made, a joint voluntary notice to CFIUS pursuant to the DPA with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
resolution of any comments received from CFIUS concerning the draft joint
voluntary notice and (iii) make, or cause to be made, appropriate filings with
respect to the Other Regulatory Approvals and the Communications Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and
in any event within the time period specified with respect to such filing set
forth on Section 5.03(c) of the Partnership Disclosure Letter. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any case within the time periods set forth by any Governmental Authority) any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), CFIUS, the FCC or any other
Governmental Authority pursuant to Antitrust Laws, the DPA, the Communications
Act or in connection with the Other Regulatory Approvals. Subject to Section
5.03(e), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment and obtain the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, the CFIUS Approval, approval under the
Communications Act, the Other Regulatory Approvals and all consents under any
Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or
local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as
to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Transactions as promptly as
reasonably practicable (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not preclude
any party from negotiating or contesting in good faith any terms or conditions
consistent with this Section 5.03). Without limiting the foregoing but subject
to Section 5.03(e), Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly take
all actions necessary to secure the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, obtain
the CFIUS Approval and the Other Regulatory Approvals and resolve any
objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under the Federal Trade
Commission Act or any other applicable Law raised by any Governmental
Authority, in order to prevent the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned, any Restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict
or delay the consummation of the Transactions, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including (i) (A) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Authority or
with any other Person, (B) agreeing to sell, divest or otherwise convey or
hold separate any particular assets or categories of assets or businesses of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, (C) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, (D) terminating any joint venture or other arrangement of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, (E) creating any relationship,
contractual right or obligation of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries,
(F) agreeing to any operational restriction, or agreeing to take any action
that limits the Partnerships or any of its Subsidiaries freedom of action,
with respect to any of the services, businesses or assets of the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries, or (G) effectuating any other change or
restructuring of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or
assets (and, in each case, entering into agreements or stipulating to the
entry of any Judgment by, or filing appropriate applications with the FTC, the
DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority in connection with any of the
foregoing and by consenting to such action by the Partnership (including any
consents required under this Agreement with respect to such action);

 



      

 

 



 

 _provided_ that any such action may, at the discretion of the Partnership, be
conditioned upon the Closing); and (ii) defending through litigation any claim
asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including
any Governmental Authority) in order to prevent the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Restraint that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or
delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any proceeding
initiated by a private Person, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed in
all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the DOJ, CFIUS or any other Governmental Authority and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other parties hereto with respect to
information relating to the other parties hereto and their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and consider in good faith all reasonable
additions, deletions, or changes suggested in connection therewith, that
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
Person or any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions,
other than "4(c) documents" as that term is used in the rules and regulations
under the HSR Act, and (iv) to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS
or such other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other parties hereto advance notice of and the opportunity to attend and
participate in meetings and teleconferences with any such Governmental
Authority or other Person. Parent and the Partnership shall jointly, and on an
equal basis, (A) control the strategy for obtaining any approvals, consents,
registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and (B) coordinate the overall development of the positions to be
taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in any filing or submission
with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry or litigation by or before,
or any negotiations with, a Governmental Authority relating to the
Transactions and of all other regulatory matters incidental thereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties are unable to agree with respect
to strategy, positions and regulatory actions for obtaining approval of the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (other than submitting the initial
filing in accordance with Section 5.03(c)), Parent shall, acting reasonably
and in good faith, direct and control all aspects of the parties efforts to
obtain such approval with respect to the matter in dispute. Neither Parent nor
the Partnership shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, any
other Antitrust Laws, the DPA or in connection with any Other Regulatory
Approval or enter into a timing agreement with any Governmental Authority,
without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Partnership shall be
required to share with the other any personal identifier information or any
competitively or commercially sensitive material regarding it or its
Affiliates that is part of any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, including if such information
is requested by such a Governmental Authority. Parent and the Partnership may,
as each deems advisable in its sole discretion, designate any such personal
identifier information or

 



     

 

 



 

competitively or commercially sensitive material provided to the other or any
Governmental Authority under this Section 5.03(d) as "Outside Counsel Only
Material", which such material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust or CFIUS counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Parent or the Partnership, as the case may be), or
its legal counsel.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect
equityholders shall be required to, and the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall not be permitted to without Parents
prior written approval (and the "reasonable best efforts" standard set forth
in this Section 5.03 shall not in any event be construed to require Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or direct or indirect
equityholders to, or to permit the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates without Parents prior written approval to), take or agree or
commit to take any action, or agree or commit to any condition or restriction,
necessary to secure the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, obtain the CFIUS Approval
and the Other Regulatory Approvals, or resolve any objections asserted with
respect to the Transactions under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any
other applicable Law raised by any Governmental Authority, that (i) would
require any action by, or would impose any condition or restriction on, any of
Parents Affiliates (other than Merger Sub) or Parents direct or indirect
equityholders, or (ii) would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such action, condition or restriction
referred to in clause (i) or (ii), a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 



 

SECTION 5.04. _Financing; Financing Cooperation._ (a) Each of Parent and
Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
customary or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and subject to the
conditions described in the Financing Letters, and, without the consent of the
Partnership, will not consent to any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any waiver of any provision or remedy under (i) the Equity Financing Letter
whatsoever (except to increase the amount of the Equity Financing) and (ii)
the Debt Commitment Letter, in the case of this clause (ii), to the extent
such amendment, modification, or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing is
increased by an equal or greater amount on terms no less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent, Merger Sub and the Partnership than in the Equity
Financing Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or (B) impose new
or additional conditions, or otherwise expand or adversely amend or modify any
of the conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions, including the Closing, (2) make the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less
likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may (x) amend or replace the Debt Commitment Letter to
add or replace lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, syndication agents,
documentation agents or similar entities, (y) amend or otherwise modify the
Debt Commitment Letter to implement any flex provisions applicable thereto and
(z) otherwise amend, modify or

 



     

 

 



 

replace, or agree to any waivers in respect of, the Debt Commitment Letter so
long as (I) such amendment, modification, replacement or waiver does not
impose new terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the Closing, (II) the terms thereof are not less beneficial
with respect to conditionality or enforcement to Parent, Merger Sub or the
Partnership than those in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
of this Agreement and (III) with respect to replacements, the replacement debt
commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative
Financing set forth below. In the event of such amendment, modification,
replacement or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the financing under such
amended, modified, replaced or waived Debt Commitment Letter will be deemed to
be "Debt Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Financing Letters (including any definitive agreements
entered into in connection therewith) until the earliest of the consummation
of the Transactions, the termination of this Agreement or the time at which
any Alternative Financing is obtained, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions in the Financing Agreements (as defined below) and in the Equity
Financing Letter applicable to Parent and Merger Sub (and that are within
their control) to obtaining the Financing, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (as modified, to the extent
exercised, by the flex provisions applicable thereto) or otherwise consistent
in all material respects with the Debt Commitment Letter and on other terms
that would not (A) reduce the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing
(unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), or (B)
impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise expand or adversely amend or
modify any of the conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing (such
definitive agreements, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Agreements_ "), and (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing (which efforts shall include making demand upon the lenders to
consummate the Financing to the extent the conditions thereto have been
satisfied (other than those which are dependent upon, or are to occur
simultaneously with, the funding of the Financing). Parent shall keep the
Partnership informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing as shall be reasonably
requested by the Partnership for purposes of monitoring the progress of the
financing activities to the extent not prohibited by the confidentiality
provisions thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
will promptly notify the Partnership (1) if Parent becomes aware of any
material breach or default by any party to the Equity Financing Letter or any
of the Financing Agreements, (2) of the receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Financing Source with respect to (x) any actual
or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Equity Financing Letter or any of the Financing Agreements or (y) any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Equity Financing
Letter or any of the Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to
fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing necessary to fund the
Transactions and (3) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
necessary to fund the Transactions. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event within five business days of the date of the Partnerships written
request to Parent), Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested
by the Partnership relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence that is in Parents possession; _provided_ , that in no
event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any

 



     

 

 



 

obligation to disclose any information that (x) is subject to attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege or doctrine if Parent or Merger
Sub shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information
in a manner that would not waive such privilege or doctrine or (y) would
contravene any applicable Law. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes,
or is reasonably likely to become, unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the applicable Financing Agreements (giving effect to, to the
extent exercised, the flex provisions applicable thereto) or for any reason
any of the Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or
rescinded, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
in replacement thereof, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the Closing),
alternative debt financing from alternative debt sources (such alternative
financing, the " _Alternative Financing_ ") (1) in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Transactions, (2) the availability of which shall not be
subject to additional or expanded conditions as compared to those set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter, (3) which would not prevent or materially delay
and would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Debt Financing or the Transactions and (4) otherwise on
terms and conditions that are not less favorable to Parent, Merger Sub and the
Partnership than the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter.
Parent shall deliver to the Partnership true and complete copies of all
Contracts or other arrangements (including fee letters redacted only for fee,
"market flex" and certain economic terms in a manner customary for
transactions of this type) related to any Alternative Financing. For purposes
of this Agreement, (x) the terms "Financing" and "Debt Financing" as used in
this Agreement will be deemed to include any such Alternative Financing, (y)
the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Financing Letters" will be deemed to
include any commitment letters with respect to any such Alternative Financing
and (z) the term "Financing Agreements" will be deemed to include any
definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative Financing.

 



 

(c) On and prior to the Closing Date, the Partnership agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to provide, to Parent such reasonable cooperation as is
necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by Parent to assist
Parent in connection with the arrangement, marketing, syndication and
consummation of the Debt Financing or any replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing permitted by this Agreement (collectively with the Debt
Financing, the " _Available Financing_ "), including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) furnish Parent and Merger Sub and their Debt Financing Sources
with (A) the audited consolidated balance sheet and the related audited
statements of income and cash flows of the Partnership and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the three most recently completed fiscal years ended at least
90 days prior to the Closing Date, (B) the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet and the related unaudited statements of income and cash flows of the
Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries for each subsequent fiscal
quarter ended at least 40 days prior to the Closing Date (but excluding the
fourth quarter of any fiscal year), which shall have been reviewed by the
Partnerships accountants ( _provided_ that the filing of the financial
statements on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q within such time periods by the
Partnership will satisfy the requirements set forth in clauses (A) and (B)
above) and (C) such other pertinent and customary financial and other
information (including financial information and data derived from the
historical books and records of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that is
required to permit Parent to prepare relevant pro forma financial statements)
as Parent shall reasonably request of the type and form that are customarily
included in private placements of non-convertible debt securities pursuant to
Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided_ that in no event shall the Required Financial Information be
deemed to include or shall the Partnership otherwise be required to provide
(A) pro forma financial statements, pro forma adjustments (including the
Financing, any synergies or cost savings), projections or an as adjusted
capitalization table, (B) any description of all or any component of the
Financing, including any such description to be included in liquidity and
capital resources disclosure or any "description of notes", (C) risk factors
relating to all or any component of the Financing, (D) "segment reporting",
subsidiary financial statements or any information of the type required by
Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X or (E) Compensation
Disclosure and Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or any
information required by Items 10 through 14 of Form 10-K) (information
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as the
" _Required Financial Information_ "), **(** ii) furnish Parent and Merger Sub
and their Debt Financing Sources with such other pertinent financial and other
information and disclosures as Parent shall reasonably request in writing and
customary and necessary to permit the consummation of the Available Financing

information documents with respect to the placement, arrangement and/or
syndication of loans of the type contemplated by such Debt Financing, to the
extent applicable, (iii) participate in a reasonable number of requested
meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings or conference calls) that
are requested in advance with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents
for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Available Financing and
the Partnerships senior management and Representatives), presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, and to reasonably cooperate with the marketing or solicitation
efforts of Parent and Merger Sub and their financing sources, in each case as
reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub and reasonably required in
connection with the Available Financing, (iv) assist with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, marketing materials, offering
documents, bank information memoranda (including with respect to presence of
or absence of material non-public information relating to the Partnership and
its Subsidiaries and the accuracy of the information relating to the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries contained therein), lender presentations,
private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents reasonably
required in connection with the Available Financing, (v) facilitate the
pledging of collateral (including obtaining and delivering customary releases,
including releases of related guarantees, liens and other security interests);
_provided_ , that no such documents or agreements shall be effective prior to
the Effective Time, (vi) take all partnership actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by Parent to permit the
consummation of the Available Financing, (vii) furnish Parent and any lenders
involved with the Available Financing, with all documentation and other
information required by any Governmental Authority with respect to such
financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering

certificates, and other customary definitive documentation relating to the
Available Financing, (ix) request its independent accountants to provide
reasonable assistance to Parent consistent with their customary practice
(including any necessary "comfort letters", on customary terms and consistent
with their customary practice in connection with the Debt Financing) and (x)

extent customary and reasonable. In no event shall the Partnership

or any of its Subsidiaries to bear any cost or expense or pay any fee (except
to the extent Parent will reimburse such cost, expense or fee), (B) require
the Partnership, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors of the
Partnership or the Partnerships Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents
to approve or authorize the execution of the Available Financing that is
effective prior to the Closing, (C) require the Partnership, its Subsidiaries
or any Persons who are officers of the Partnership or the Partnerships
Subsidiaries to execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or
agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate,
document, instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing
(other than customary authorization letters in connection with syndication
efforts and a customary representation letter required to be delivered by the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to its auditors to obtain a customary
comfort letter), (D) cause any director, officer or employee or equityholder
of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability
in connection with the Debt Financing, (E) violate any applicable Law or

Agreement to be breached by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, (G)

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Partnership, reimburse the
Partnership for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
costs of the Partnerships preparation of its annual and quarterly reports on
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the financial statements included therein)
incurred by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives in connection with the Available Financing, including the
cooperation of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and Representatives
contemplated by this Section 5.04, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Partnership, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Available
Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except with
respect to (i) any information provided by the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in writing expressly
for use in connection with the Available Financing or (ii) any fraud or
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct by any such persons.
Nothing in this Section 5.04 or otherwise shall require the Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor
with respect to any of the Available Financing. The Partnership hereby
consents to the reasonable use of its and the Partnerships Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Available Financing; _provided_ that such logos
shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to
harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Partnership, any of the
Partnerships Subsidiaries or their respective reputation or goodwill.

 



 

(e) The Partnership shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
customary notices and take all other reasonably necessary actions to
facilitate the termination on the Closing

 



     

 

 



 

Date of all commitments in respect of the Credit Facility, the repayment in
full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the Indebtedness
thereunder, and the release on the Closing Date of any Liens securing such
Indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries shall
deliver to Parent prior to the Closing an executed payoff letter with respect
to the Credit Facility (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and substance
customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent on behalf
of the persons to whom such Indebtedness is owed, which Payoff Letter together
with any related release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that Liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in
connection with the Credit Facility relating to the assets, rights and
properties of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries securing or relating to
such Indebtedness, shall, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the
applicable Payoff Letter at or prior to the Effective Time, be released and
terminated. The obligations of the Partnership pursuant to this Section
5.04(e) shall be subject to Parent or Merger Sub providing or causing to be
provided all funds required to effect all such repayments at or prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ that, no such repayment shall be required to be
made prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub, or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all non-public or otherwise confidential
information provided to IFM Investors Pty Ltd or its Representatives before,
on or after the date hereof pursuant to this Section 5.04 may be disclosed to,
and used in connection with the Debt Financing by, any actual or prospective
Debt Financing Sources and their respective Representatives pursuant to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, and any such recipients of non-public
or otherwise confidential information shall be deemed to be "Representatives"
of IFM Investors Pty Ltd under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.05. _Public Announcements._ Unless and until an Adverse
Recommendation Change has occurred, Parent and the Partnership shall consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, Judgment, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and
except for any matters referred to in, and made in compliance with, Section
5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued
with respect to the Transactions following execution of this Agreement shall
be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties hereto (the "
_Announcement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.05 shall not
apply to any press release or other public statement made by the Partnership,
Parent or the Fund (a) which is consistent with the Announcement and the terms
of this Agreement and does not contain any information relating to the
Partnership that has not been previously announced or made public in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (b) is made in the ordinary
course of business and does not relate specifically to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, Parent and its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives, without consultation with, or consent
of, the Partnership or the

 



     

 

 



 

General Partner, may make ordinary course disclosures and communications in
connection with fundraising or other investment related activities to its
current or prospective general or limited partners, equityholders, members,
managers or investors; _provided_ that any references to this Agreement or the
Transactions contained therein shall be consistent with the Announcement and
the terms of this Agreement and may not contain any information relating to
the Partnership that has not been previously announced or made public in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.06. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to applicable
Law, between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01, upon
reasonable notice and for purposes of furthering the Transactions or
integration planning relating thereto, the Partnership shall afford to Parent
and Parents Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
(i) the Partnerships officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
Contracts, records and other information reasonably requested by Parent (other
than any of the foregoing that relate to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement, or, except as expressly provided in Section 5.02, to any Takeover
Proposal or any other transactions potentially competing with or alternative
to the Transactions or proposals from other parties relating to any competing
or alternative transactions or relating to any deliberation of the Partnership
Board or any committee thereof regarding an Adverse Recommendation Change),
and the Partnership shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parents
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that
such access shall not include any right to conduct intrusive or invasive
environmental testing or sampling; _provided further_ , _that_ Parent and its
Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Partnership and
(ii) information related to the financial or Tax records of the Partnership
and its Subsidiaries, including Tax Returns (including any supporting
documents), elections, Contracts, schedules, officers certificates, analyses,
memoranda, tax opinions, and any other information in the Partnerships
possession, in each case, (A) to the extent not made available to Parent in
connection with the execution of this Agreement and related to an activity or
commercial arrangement giving rise to a material item of income not previously
included in the gross income of the Partnership in any taxable year since the
year ended December 31, 2005, as may be reasonably requested by Parent to
assess that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, at least 90% of the gross
income of the Partnership for each calendar quarter after the calendar quarter
ending March 31, 2019, through and including the calendar quarter in which the
Closing Date occurs will be treated as income that is "qualifying income"
within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code and (B) in the event there
is a change in law (by changes in the Code, the regulations promulgated
thereunder, IRS rulings, or judicial decisions) following the date of this
Agreement with respect to the treatment of any material item of income
included in the gross income of the Partnership as "qualifying income" within
the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code in any taxable year for which the
statute of limitations for the federal income tax return of the Partnership
has not yet expired, as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assess such
qualification of such item of income taking into account such change in law;
_provided further_ , _however_ , in each of cases (i) and (ii), that the
Partnership shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if,
in the opinion of the Partnerships legal counsel, doing so would (A) violate
applicable Law, an applicable Judgment or a Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a third party or (B) jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or

 



     

 

 



 

other legal privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Partnership does not provide access or information in reliance on the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is
withholding such access or information and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Judgment, Contract or
obligation or jeopardize such privilege, including entering into a customary
joint defense agreement, common interest agreement or other similar
arrangement. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.06
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Partnership. Until the Effective Time, all non-public information provided
(including information provided by the Partnership, its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective Representatives pursuant to Section 5.04 and this Section
5.06) will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement dated as of
February 4, 2019 by and among the Partnership and IFM Investors Pty Ltd (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _Indemnification and Insurance._ (a) From and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, to the fullest extent permissible
by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Partnership or of a Subsidiary of the
Partnership (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_
") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any
Action (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Partnership or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in
the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Partnership or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Partnership or
such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the
Partnership or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent,
trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)),
in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee) and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Partnership and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in
respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
as provided in the Partnership Organizational Documents and the organizational
documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or
in any agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement providing for
indemnification between the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate
of limited partnership and agreement of limited partnership of the Surviving
Entity to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect
to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification
than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Partnership
Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall, without requiring a preliminary determination of
entitlement to indemnification, advance any expenses (including reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this
Section 5.07 (including in connection with

 



     

 

 



 

enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in this Section
5.07) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the individual to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that such Person
is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.07(a).

 



 

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation, claim or
proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.07
(each, a " _Claim_ ") for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and
the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



 

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect the Partnerships current
directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those Indemnitees
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Partnerships directors and officers liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy); _provided_ that if the aggregate annual premium
for such insurance exceeds 300% of the annual premium for such insurance as of
the date hereof (the " _Premium Cap_ "), then the Surviving Entity shall cause
to be provided a policy covering such individuals with the most advantageous
coverage as is then available at a cost up to but not exceeding the Premium
Cap. The Partnership may (or, at the request of Parent, the Partnership
shall), in consultation with Parent, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits, individually and in the aggregate, as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or
occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
Transactions, at an aggregate cost up to but not exceeding the Premium Cap for
such six-year period. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by the
Partnership, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance
pursuant to this Section 5.07(c) and the Surviving Entity shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Partnership Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity under this Section 5.07
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.07 applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.07 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.07).

 



 

(e) In the event that (i) Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, or (ii) Parent or any of its
successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Entity shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this Section 5.07.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.07 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

(g) Parents and the Surviving Entitys obligations under this Section 5.07
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Claim (whether arising
before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnitee on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 5.07 shall continue in effect until the full and final resolution of
such Claim.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Employee Matters._ (a) Subject to any applicable collective
bargaining agreements, for a period of not less than two years following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity (or in the
case of a transfer of all or substantially all the assets and businesses of
the Surviving Entity, its successors and assigns) to, provide (i) base salary
or wages and target cash annual bonus opportunities to each person who is an
employee of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Partnership Employee_ ") that are no less
favorable, in each case, than those in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Partnership Employee that are
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Partnership
Employee under the applicable severance benefit plans, programs, policies,
agreements and arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time as set forth on Section 5.08(a) of the Partnership Disclosure Letter and
(iii) employee benefits (other than base salary, short-term incentive
opportunities and severance benefits) to Partnership Employees that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate in value to the value of employee
benefits provided to the Partnership Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case, for purposes of determining value, excluding
base salary, short-term incentive opportunities and severance benefits);
_provided that_ , in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be required
to maintain any equity plans, defined benefit plans or retiree medical plans
for the benefit of Partnership Employees from and after the Effective Time.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) Except in the case of the Partnership Equity Plans, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, honor in
accordance with their terms all the Partnership Plans as in effect at the
Effective Time, subject to any right to amend or terminate such plan in
accordance with its terms. Parent and the Partnership hereby acknowledges that
the consummation of the Merger Transactions constitutes a "change in control"
or "change of control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any
Partnership Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change
of control" (or a term of similar import), as applicable. The Partnership
acknowledges and agrees that, pursuant to Section 2.03, the Partnership Equity
Plans shall be terminated upon the consummation of the Merger Transactions.

 



 

(c) With respect to applicable, non-frozen employee benefit plans of Parent,
the Surviving Entity and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates in which
Partnership Employees will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans),
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting, benefit accrual (other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan) and, with respect to Partnership Plans in effect on the date
hereof, early retirement subsidies, each Partnership Employees service with
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Partnership or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the Partnership or
such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Entity
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (or in the case of a
transfer of all or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving
Entity, its successors and assigns); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized (i) for purposes of any defined benefit plan,
grandfathered or frozen plan or retirement health plan or (ii) to the extent
that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.08(a), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any
welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in which Partnership Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Partnership Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by
each Partnership Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time.

 



 

(e) (i) Prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the annual bonuses payable
under the Partnerships Annual Incentive Compensation Plan (the " _Partnership
Annual Bonus Plan_ ") for the fiscal year in which Closing occurs (the "
_Closing Fiscal Year_ "), the Partnership Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) shall determine the level of attainment of all applicable

 



     

 

 



 

performance goals under the Partnership Annual Bonus Plan for the period
commencing on the first day of such Closing Fiscal Year and ending on the day
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Performance Period_ "), using
good faith methodology consistent with past practice (taking into account such
factors as the target bonuses payable with respect to the Closing Fiscal Year)
and based on the most recent forecast of the Partnerships financial
performance for the Closing Fiscal Year and, based on such determination,
shall determine the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the Partnership
Annual Bonus Plan with respect to the Pre-Closing Performance Period (the "
_Pre-Closing Bonus Amount_ "); and (ii) as soon as practicable after the last
day of the Closing Fiscal Year, the Surviving Entity shall determine the level
of attainment of all applicable performance goals under the Partnership Annual
Bonus Plan for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the
last day of the Closing Fiscal Year (the " _Post-Closing Performance Period_
"), using good faith methodology consistent with past practice and taking into
account such factors as the target bonuses payable under Partnership Annual
Bonus Plan for the Closing Fiscal Year and, based on such determination, shall
determine the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the Partnership Annual
Bonus Plan with respect to the Post-Closing Performance Period (the " _Post-
Closing Bonus Amount_ " and, together with the Pre-Closing Bonus Amount,
collectively, the " _Aggregate Bonus Amount_ "). The Surviving Entity shall
pay, to the Partnership Employees who are participants in the Partnership
Annual Bonus Plan during the Closing Fiscal Year, the Aggregate Bonus Amount
and such payments shall be made in accordance with the terms of the
Partnership Annual Bonus Plan at the same time as annual bonuses would be paid
thereunder in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
(and in no event later than March 15 immediately following the Closing Fiscal
Year).

 



 

(f) With respect to any Partnership Employee whose principal place of
employment is outside the United States (" _Non-U.S. Partnership Employee_ "),
Parents obligations under this Section 5.08 shall be modified to the extent
necessary to comply with any applicable Law that applies in relation to the
employment or terms of employment of such Partnership Employee; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent provide, or cause
to be provided, to any Non-U.S. Partnership Employee compensation and benefits
at levels that are less favorable than required under Section 5.08(a).

 



 

(g) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 5.08 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and, except as
otherwise explicitly provided for in this Agreement, no current or former
employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or have the right
to enforce the provisions hereof.

 



 

SECTION 5.09. _Notification of Certain Matters; Unitholder Litigation._ (a)
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Partnership, and the Partnership shall give prompt notice to Parent, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Partnership, the Surviving Entity or Parent, (ii) any

 



     

 

 



 

Actions commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against such party
which relates to this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) any effect, change,
event, fact, condition, development or occurrence known to it that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect and (iv) any effect, change, event, fact, condition,
development or occurrence known to it that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.09 shall not cure
any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_ , that any failure
to give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to
constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, in each case unless the underlying effect, change, event, fact,
condition, development or occurrence would independently result in a failure
of the applicable conditions set forth in Article VI to be satisfied.

 



 

(b) The Partnership shall (i) give Parent the opportunity to participate in,
but not control, the defense or settlement of any unitholder litigation
against the Partnership or its Affiliates or any of their respective directors
or officers relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) afford Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on filings and responses
related thereto, which comments the Partnership shall consider in good faith
and (iii) keep Parent apprised of, and consult with Parent with respect to,
proposed strategy and any significant decisions related thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership shall not be required to provide information
if doing so, in the opinion of the Partnerships legal counsel, would (A)
violate any applicable Law or Judgment or (B) jeopardize the protection of an
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection or other legal
privilege; _provided further_ , _that_ , if any information is withheld
pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Partnership shall inform Parent as to
the general nature of what is being withheld and the Partnership shall use
reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable
information in a way that would not violate the applicable Law or judgment or
jeopardize such legal privilege, including entering into a customary joint
defense agreement, common interest agreement or other similar arrangement. The
Partnership agrees that it shall not settle any unitholder litigation against
the Partnership or its directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions where such settlement would impose obligations (monetary or
otherwise) on the Partnership or the Surviving Entity without Parents prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ that, such consent shall not be required for (x)
settlements solely for money damages and the payment of attorneys fees in an
aggregate amount not in excess of the dollar amount of the coverage limits for
such settlements under the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance maintained by the Partnership and its Subsidiaries or (y)
providing additional disclosure in the Proxy Statement; _provided_ that, prior
to agreeing to provide any such additional disclosure in the Proxy Statement,
the Partnership shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such proposed additional disclosure, which the
Partnership shall consider in good faith.

Partnership and the General Partner shall take all such steps as may be
reasonably necessary or advisable to cause any dispositions of Partnership

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Partnership to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Fund) has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted,

Agreement shall be submitted for approval and at all adjournments or
postponements thereof.

agreement, arrangement or understanding with any other Person that would
reasonably be expected to prevent such person from making a Takeover Proposal
or (b) participate in or enter into any conversations, discussions or
negotiations or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any other Person with respect to the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by
such other Person of any securities or assets of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with respect to the creation of any joint venture by any such
other Person that involves any securities or assets of the Partnership or any
of its Subsidiaries (including by the acquisition of any equity interests in
Parent, Merger Sub or any Person of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect
Subsidiary) if the Partnership has delivered written notice to Parent that
such other Person has made a Takeover Proposal after the date hereof (and
shall cease forthwith any such conversations, discussions, or negotiations
upon delivery of such notice); _provided_ that Parent and its Affiliates, and
its and their respective Representatives, shall be permitted to enter into any
such agreements, arrangements or understandings with any Person that is as of
the date of this Agreement, or becomes after the date of this Agreement (other
than for purposes of avoiding the restrictions in this Section 5.12), (a) any

advised or managed by IFM Investors Pty Ltd or (c) any limited partner or
other investor in the Fund.

delivered to Parent resignations executed by each member of the Partnership
Board in office as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective

the Partnership shall prepare the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and file

and the resolution of any comments thereto received from the SEC. Each of the
Partnership, Parent and Merger Sub shall correct any information provided by
it for use in the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable if and
to the extent such information shall contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Partnership shall notify
Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any
request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and
shall advise Parent of any oral comments and supply Parent with copies of all
written correspondence between the Partnership or any of its Representatives,

disseminated to its unitholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the resolution of any such comments or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the tenth day after the Proxy Statement is filed if the SEC has not
informed the Partnership that it will review the Proxy Statement. Prior to the
filing of the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or any
dissemination thereof to the unitholders of the Partnership, or responding to

Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response, which the Partnership shall consider in good faith.

meeting of its unitholders (including any adjournment, recess or postponement

practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement or as soon as reasonably practicable after the tenth day after
the Proxy Statement is filed if the SEC has not informed the Partnership that
it will review the Proxy Statement. The Partnership shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Partnership may
adjourn, recess, or postpone the Partnership Unitholders Meeting (i) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement that the Partnership, after consultation with

disseminated and reviewed by the unitholders of the Partnership in advance of
the Partnership Unitholders Meeting, (ii) to

 



     

 

 



 

the extent required by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with
any proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii) if
as of the time for which the Partnership Unitholders Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient
Partnership Units represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Partnership Unitholders
Meeting or (iv) to solicit additional proxies if necessary in order to obtain
the Partnership Unitholder Approval ( _provided_ that the Partnership shall
not adjourn, recess or postpone the Partnership Unitholders Meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof) pursuant to the foregoing clauses (iii)

adjournment or postponement thereof) without Parents prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned));
_provided_ , _however_ , that in each case, the Partnership shall not be
permitted to postpone or adjourn the Partnership Unitholders Meeting to a
date after the date that is two business days prior to the Outside Date. The

related and customary procedural matters (including a proposal to adjourn the
meeting to allow additional solicitation of votes).

 



 

SECTION 5.16. _ServiceCo Matters_. (a) The General Partner, the Partnership,

requested by Parent (i) to obtain the Trustee Approval as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, replacing the Trustee as trustee of the ESOP) and (ii) with
respect to the ESOP, including making (or refraining from making) any
submission or filing relating to the ESOP with any Governmental Authority that
Parent reasonably deems necessary or desirable in connection with the ESOPs
or ServiceCos obligations under applicable Law (and shall keep Parent
informed of all communications with or from such Governmental Authority
relating thereto). Subject to the foregoing, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
General Partner, the Partnership and ServiceCo shall cooperate in good faith
and use its reasonable best efforts to (i) prior to the Closing, prepare
drafts of all necessary documents to obtain from the IRS a determination
letter for termination of the ESOP as promptly as practicable following the

Partnership and ServiceCo shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Trustee to transfer to Parent or one of its designated Affiliates, immediately
prior to the Closing and in accordance with Section 2.01(e), (x) all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of ServiceCo or (y) all, substantially all,
or a material portion of the assets of ServiceCo pursuant to the ServiceCo
Purchase Agreement. If Parent does not make the ServiceCo Election, the
General Partner, the Partnership and ServiceCo shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably directed by
Parent to effect the transfer of control of ServiceCo to Parent or one of its
Affiliates or the transfer of all employees and assets of ServiceCo to Parent
or one of its Affiliates, including, if directed by Parent, (A) delivering
resignations effecting the removal of any or all members of the ServiceCo
Board as of the Effective Time, (B) delivering resolutions of the ServiceCo
Board effecting the removal of any or all members of the committee appointed
by the ServiceCo Board to supervise the administration of the ESOP in
accordance with the

 



     

 

 



 

terms of the ESOP (the " _ServiceCo Committee_ ") as of the Effective Time,
(C) effecting, as of the Effective Time, the election of the designees
identified by Parent to the Partnership to the ServiceCo Board and, if
applicable, the ServiceCo Committee to fill any vacancies thereon (including
as a result of the resignation or removal, as applicable, of any members
thereof in accordance with this Section 5.16(a)), and (D) replacing the
Trustee. The parties agree that ESOP and Parent will jointly make an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to Parents or its
Affiliates acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
ServiceCo.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity to, (i) cooperate and provide the Trustee and
ServiceCo with such support and assistance as shall be reasonably requested by
the Trustee or ServiceCo and (ii) reimburse the Trustee and ServiceCo for any
costs, expenses or fees (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal and
financial advisors to the Trustee and ServiceCo) associated with taking such
actions as shall be necessary or advisable to complete the distribution of the
assets held by the ESOP to the participants thereof as promptly as practicable
following the Closing. The Trustee is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this Section 5.16(b).

SECTION 7.03. _Termination Fee._ (a) In the event that:

 



 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Partnership or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to Section

made to the Partnership Board or publicly made, proposed or communicated by a
third party after the date of this Agreement and not withdrawn prior to the
time this Agreement is terminated and (B) within 12 months of the date this
Agreement is terminated, the Partnership enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate any Takeover Proposal or consummates any Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ that, for purposes of clauses (A) and (B) of this Section
7.03(a)(i), the references to "15%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal

(ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section

Parent could have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii) at

then, in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.03(a), the
Partnership shall pay or cause to be paid the Partnership Termination Fee to
Parent or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by Parent for such payment (x) in the case of Section

this Section 7.03(a), the amount of the Parent Expenses shall be credited
towards the payment of the Partnership Termination Fee.

 



 

As used herein, " _Partnership Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $130,000,000:

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Partnership
pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(iii) or (ii) by the Partnership or Parent pursuant
to Section 7.01(b)(i) if the Partnership could have terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Parent

7.01(c)(i) or (ii) Section 7.01(b)(i) if at the time of such termination the
Agreement could have been validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i),
then the Partnership shall pay or cause to be paid the Parent Expenses to
Parent or its designee by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by Parent for such payment within two business days after such
termination.

 



 

(d) Each party hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Parent or the Partnership fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.03 when due and, in order to obtain the payment,
such party hereto commences an Action which results in a judgment against
Parent or the Partnership for any payment set forth in this Section 7.03,
Parent or the Partnership, as applicable, shall pay the other party hereto its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented outside attorneys fees and disbursements) in
connection with such Action, together with interest on the applicable amount
from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment
at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made. Each of the parties further
acknowledges that the payment of the amounts by the Partnership or Parent, as
applicable, specified in this Section 7.03 is not a penalty, but, in each
case, is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
or the Partnership, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such fees are
payable for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in the event
that the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the Partnership pursuant to Section
7.03(b), the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, employees, partners, equityholders,
optionholders, securityholders, limited partners, controlling Person,
shareholders, managers, trustees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents, assignees, members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Partnership Related
Parties_ ") against Parent, Merger Sub, the Fund or any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, shareholders,
equityholders, optionholders, securityholders, financing sources (including
the Debt Financing Sources), controlling Persons, managers, members,
directors, officers, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents,
assignees or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ")
(except that the Fund shall be obligated pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Limited Guarantee and Parent shall be obligated to the Partnership
under the first sentence of this Section 7.03(d)), and (ii) in the event that
the Partnership Termination Fee is paid to Parent pursuant to Section 7.03(a),
the Partnership Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Parent Related Parties against the Partnership Related Parties (except that
the Partnership shall be obligated to Parent under the first sentence of this
Section 7.03(d)), in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), for any loss suffered
as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise (including a Willful
Breach), and upon payment of such amount(s), as applicable, none of the
Partnership Related Parties or the Parent Related Parties, as applicable,
shall have any further liability or obligation, whether in law, equity,
contract, tort or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement, or
the Transactions (and in the case of the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, none of the Parent Related Parties

 



     

 

 



 

shall have any such further liability or obligation to the Partnership Related
Parties relating to or arising out of, the Equity Financing Letters, the
Equity Financing, the Limited Guarantee, the Debt Commitment Letters (and any
abandonment thereof), the Financing Agreements or the Debt Financing)
(including a Willful Breach). The Parent Related Parties and the Partnership
Related Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this Section 7.03.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (A) under no
circumstances will the maximum aggregate liability of Parent or Merger Sub for
monetary damages or other monetary remedies (including payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, any losses or other amounts payable pursuant to this sentence
or any other damages related to this Agreement (including a Willful Breach))
in connection with this Agreement, the agreements contemplated hereby or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby be greater than the sum of (1) the
Parent Termination Fee and (2) any amounts, if any, due and owing pursuant to
the first sentence of this Section 7.03(d) not to exceed $5,000,000, and (B)
in no event shall any Partnership Related Party seek or obtain, nor shall it
permit any of its Representatives or any other Person on its or their behalf
to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award or any monetary
damages of any kind against Parent and Merger Sub in excess of the sum of (1)
the Parent Termination Fee and (2) any amounts, if any, due and owing pursuant
to the first sentence of this Section 7.03(d) not to exceed $5,000,000.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) under no
circumstances will the maximum aggregate liability of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries for monetary damages or other monetary remedies (including
payment of the Partnership Termination Fee, any losses or other amounts
payable pursuant to this sentence or any other damages related to this
Agreement (including a Willful Breach)) in connection with this Agreement, the
agreements contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby be greater than the sum of (I) the Partnership Termination Fee and
(II) any amounts, if any, due and owing pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 7.03(d) not to exceed $5,000,000, and (y) in no event shall any Parent
Related Party seek or obtain, nor shall it permit any of its Representatives
or any other Person on its or their behalf to seek or obtain, any monetary
recovery or monetary award or any monetary damages of any kind against the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries in excess of the sum of (I) the Partnership
Termination Fee and (II) any amounts, if any, due and owing pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 7.03(d) not to exceed $5,000,000. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 7.03 shall be deemed
to affect their injunction, specific performance and equitable relief rights
and related rights in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
Section 8.08.

be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties hereto. Each
party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party in any Action

property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts, (iii) agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 8.10 shall

such court, (iv) waives and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (v) agrees that a final
judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law, and (vi) agrees that the provisions of Section 8.09 relating

(other than sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations
Law).

 



 

SECTION 8.08. _Specific Enforcement._ (a) The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage for which monetary relief (including any fees payable
pursuant to Section 7.03), even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate this Agreement and the Transactions. The parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) without limitation of Section 8.08(b), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 7.03 (A) may not adequately compensate for the
harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) subject to
Section 8.08(c), shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any partys right to specific enforcement and (iii) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right neither the Partnership nor Parent would have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy, that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at Law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity, other than an assertion that the exercise of specific
performance was not effected in accordance with this Section 8.08. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
8.08 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
acknowledged and agreed that the Partnership shall be entitled to obtain an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with Parents or Merger Subs obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be
funded and to consummate the Closing if, and only if, each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (i) all of the closing conditions set forth in
Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 were satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
provided that such conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if the
Closing were to take place on such date) at the time when the Closing would
have been required to occur but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded, (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02, (iii) the Debt Financing
has been funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms thereof if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iv) the Partnership has
confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that if an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedy is granted and the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the Partnership and General
Partner will cause the Closing to occur.

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, while the Partnership or the General Partner
may pursue both a grant of specific performance in connection with Parents or
Merger Subs obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Closing as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this
Section 8.08 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (or, subject to
Section 7.02 and Section 7.03(c), other monetary damages), under no
circumstances shall Parent be obligated to both specifically perform the terms
of this Agreement and pay the Parent Termination Fee (or other monetary
damages).

any provision of this Agreement.

hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and Representatives,
that all Actions or causes of action (whether in Contract or in tort, in Law
or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
