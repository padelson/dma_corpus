Schedule  EXHIBITS  Exhibit A - Shareholder Agreement Exhibit B -
Articles of Merger Exhibit C - Affiliate Agreement   iv.    AGREEMENT
AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of May 16,
2001, by and among Credence  --------- Systems Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Iguana Acquisition  ------ Corporation, an Oregon
corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly owned subsidiary of 
---------- Parent, and Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc., an Oregon
corporation ("Company").  -------  RECITALS:   A. The Boards of Directors
of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is in the best interests of
their respective companies and the shareholders of their respective companies
that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single company through the
statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Merger") and, in
furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger.  ------   B. Pursuant to the
Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
$0.01 par value ("Company Common Stock"), shall  -------------------- be
converted into shares of Parent Common Stock, $0.001 par value ("Parent 
------ Common Stock"), at the rate set forth herein. ------------   C.
Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and
warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.   D. The
parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and to cause the Merger to qualify as
a  ---- reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
use reasonable best efforts to qualify as a pooling of interests for
financial accounting purposes.   E. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement and as an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, certain shareholders of Company have on the date hereof entered
into shareholder agreements in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each a
"Shareholder  --------- ----------- Agreement") to vote the shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such persons to --------- approve the
Merger.   AGREEMENT:   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto agree as follows:    ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The
Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and 
---------- subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the Articles of Merger attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Articles of
Merger") and the  --------- ------------------ applicable provisions of the
Business Corporation Act of the State of Oregon ("Oregon Law"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into Company, the separate  ---------- corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation. Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation." 
---------------------   1.2 Closing; Effective Time. The closing of the
transactions  ----------------------- contemplated hereby (the "Closing")
shall take place as soon as practicable (and  ------- in any event not later
than two business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof or at such other time as the
parties hereto agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place 
------------ at the offices of Ater Wynne LLP, 222 S.W. Columbia Street,
Suite 1800, Portland, OR 97201-6018, or at such other location as the parties
hereto agree. In connection with the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause
the Merger to be consummated by filing the Articles of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Oregon, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of Oregon Law (the time of the filing of such document, or such
later time as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth in the Articles
of Merger, being the "Effective  --------- Time"). ----   1.3 Effect of
the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the 
-------------------- Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the
Articles of Merger and the applicable provisions of Oregon Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all title to all real estate and other property owned Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, without reversion or
impairment, and all obligations, including contractual, tortious, statutory
and administrative obligations, shall be the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. 
---------------------------------   (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles
of Incorporation of Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as
set forth in the Plan of Merger attached to the Articles of Merger and as so
amended shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended as provided by Oregon Law and such Articles of
Incorporation.   (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.   1.5 Directors and Officers. At the
Effective Time, the directors of  ---------------------- the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time and Keith L. Barnes, in each case until their successors are
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier resignation
or removal. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be Keith L.
Barnes, (President) Fred Hall (Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
Secretary) and John Detwiler (Vice President and Assistant Secretary) until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier resignation or removal.   2    1.6 Effect on Capital
Stock. By virtue of the Merger and without any 
----------------------- action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:   (a) Conversion of Company
Common Stock. At the Effective  ---------------------------------- Time,
subject to Section 1.6(f), each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b))
will be canceled and extinguished and be converted automatically into the
right to receive 0.9 shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Exchange Ratio").
All references in this  -------------- Agreement to Parent Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed to include the corresponding
rights to purchase stock of Parent pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as
of June 2, 1998 between Parent and BankBoston, N.A. (as Rights Agent).  
(b) Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or 
------------------------------------------------------- Company. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are ------- owned by
Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or
of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof.   (c) Company Stock Option
Plans. At the Effective Time,  -------------------------- Company\'s 1995
Stock Incentive Plan, 1995 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and
2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (collectively the "Company 
------- Stock Option Plans") and all options to purchase Company Common Stock
then ------------------ outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans
shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.9. The Company ESPP
(as defined below) shall terminate prior to the Effective Time, in accordance
with Section 5.9.   (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective
Time,  --------------------------- each share of common stock, $0.001 par
value, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common  ----------------- Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be ----- converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and
the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Each
stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange
Ratio shall  ----------------------------- be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and of any increase in
the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of Company Common Stock, issued and outstanding
after the date hereof relative to such number as derived from Section 2.2
hereof (except to the extent of stock options granted in accordance with
Section 4.2(e)), so as to provide holders of Company Common Stock and Parent
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, like change or increase.   3    (f) Fractional Shares.
No fraction of a share of Parent  ----------------- Common Stock will be
issued, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be
received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of a share of Parent
Common Stock as quoted on The Nasdaq National Market for the ten (10) trading
days ending on the third full trading day prior to the Effective Time.  
1.7 Surrender of Certificates.  -------------------------   (a) Exchange
Agent. Parent\'s transfer agent shall act as  -------------- exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.  --------------   (b) Parent to
Provide Common Stock and Cash. Promptly after 
--------------------------------------- the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
I, through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, (i) the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (provided that delivery of any shares  -------- that are subject to
vesting and/or repurchase rights in favor of Company shall be in book entry
form until such vesting and/or repurchase rights lapse) and (ii) cash in an
amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f).   (c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable  ------------------- after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates")  ------------ which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares)
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the
Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates (or book entries
in the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights in
favor of Company) representing shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be sent in exchange therefor a certificate (or book entry
in the case of shares that are subject to vesting and/or repurchase rights)
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and payment in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to
the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate the merger consideration contemplated by
Section 1.6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article I.   4    (d)
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No 
------------------------------------------------ dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable (but for the provisions of this Section 1.7(d))
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   (e) Transfers of
Ownership. If any certificate for shares of  ---------------------- Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be
a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f) No Liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in  ------------ this Section 1.7,
none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any party
hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   1.8 Termination of Exchange Agent Funding. Any portion of funds 
------------------------------------- (including any interest earned thereon)
or certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent
which have not been delivered to holders of Certificates pursuant to this
Article I within six months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid
or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and thereafter holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures
set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for their
claim for shares of Parent Common Stock and, only as general creditors
thereof, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions (with a record date after the Effective Time) with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled.   1.9 No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares 
--------------------------------------------------- of Parent Common Stock
issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.  
5    1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any 
-------------------------------------- Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash
in lieu of fractional shares) as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6;
provided, however, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a  --------
------- condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect
to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   1.11
Tax and Accounting Consequences. It is intended by the parties 
------------------------------- hereto that the Merger shall (a) constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (b)
qualify for accounting treatment as a pooling of interests.   1.12
Withholding Rights. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be 
------------------ entitled to deduct and withhold from the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, and from
any other payments made pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as Parent
and the Surviving Corporation are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such delivery and payment under the Code or any provision of
federal, national, state, local, provincial or foreign tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the holder of
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation.   1.13 Taking
of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after 
------------------------------------------ the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession
to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company
and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub are
fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to
take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such
action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.    ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   In this Agreement, any reference
to any event, matter, change, condition, circumstance or effect being
"material" with respect to any person  -------- means any material event,
matter, change, condition, circumstance or effect related to the condition
and prospects (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including
intangible assets), liabilities, business, operations or results of
operations of such person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. In this
Agreement, any reference to a "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to any 
----------------------- person means any event, matter, change, condition,
circumstance or effect that is materially adverse to the condition or
prospects (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including intangible
assets), liabilities, business, operations or results of operations of such
person and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, provided, however, that a
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not  -------- ------- include: (a) a
decrease, in and of itself, in the   6   trading price or volume of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock; or (b) general changes in the
automatic test equipment or integrated circuit validation systems markets or
general changes in economic conditions that affect such person or its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (c) to the extent occurring after the date
of this Agreement with respect to Parent or Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries, the loss of customers or suppliers, or loss
or reduction of orders or shipments from customers or suppliers, to the
extent that such losses or reductions are primarily attributable to the
announcement or pendency of the Merger.   In this Agreement, any reference
to a party\'s "knowledge" means such  --------- party\'s actual knowledge
after reasonable inquiry of officers, directors and other employees of such
party charged with senior administrative or operational responsibility for
such matters.   As used in this Agreement, the words "subsidiary" or
"subsidiaries"  ---------- ------------ means, with respect to any person,
any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) such person or any other subsidiary of such
person is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the general partnership
interests of which held by such person or any subsidiary of such person do
not have a majority of the voting interest in such partnership) or (ii) at
least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors,
or others performing similar functions with respect to such corporation or
other organization, is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such
person or by one or more of its subsidiaries.   Except as expressly
disclosed in that section of the document of even date herewith delivered by
Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the 
--------------------------- Section of this Agreement to which any of the
following representations and warranties specifically relate, Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:   2.1
Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Company and its 
-------------------------------- subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each
of Company and its subsidiaries has the corporate power to own its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as presently proposed
to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct copy of the
Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of 
----------- Incorporation"), and Second Restated Bylaws or other charter
documents, as ------------- applicable, of Company and each of its
subsidiaries, each as amended to date. Neither Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its respective
charter or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. Company is the
owner of all outstanding shares of capital stock of each of its subsidiaries
and all such shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each such
subsidiary are owned by Company free and clear of all liens, charges, claims
or encumbrances or rights of others. There are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible
securities or other commitments or agreements of any character relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock or other securities of any
such subsidiary, or otherwise obligating Company or any such subsidiary to
issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any such
securities. Company does not directly or   7   indirectly own any equity
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or
exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business
association or entity (excluding securities in publicly traded companies held
for passive investment and comprising less than 1% of the outstanding stock
of such company).   2.2 Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of
Company  ----------------- consists of 15,000,000 shares of Common stock,
$0.01 par value, of which there were issued and outstanding as of the close
of business on May 15, 2001, 7,889,987 shares, and 10,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock $0.01 par value of which 150,000 shares have been designated

5.9(a) hereto  --------------- sets forth a true and complete list as of the
date hereof of all holders of outstanding options under the Company Stock
Option Plans, including the number of shares of Company capital stock subject
to each such option, the exercise or vesting schedule, the exercise price per
share and the term of each such option. On the Closing Date, Company shall
deliver to Parent an updated Schedule 5.9(a)  --------------- hereto current
as of such date. Each such option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set
forth in the Company Stock Option Plans and the applicable stock option
agreements, immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)
such option will be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent

Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio and rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of such assumed option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was

that the options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent
permissible, following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent such options qualified as
incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time. Within 30 business  
36   days after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each person who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding option
under the Company Stock Option Plans a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such option by Parent.   (b) All outstanding rights of
Company which it may hold immediately prior to the Effective Time to
repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the "Repurchase Options")
shall continue in effect following the Merger  ------------------ and shall

PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION  52   Form of  -------  EXHIBIT A 
---------   SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT   THIS SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT (this
"Agreement") is entered into as of  --------- May 16, 2001, by and among
Credence Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Iguana
Acquisition Corporation, an Oregon corporation and wholly  ------ owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the undersigned shareholder 
---------- ("Shareholder") of Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc., a Oregon
corporation ------------- ("Company"). ---------   RECITALS:   WHEREAS,
Parent has agreed to acquire the outstanding securities of Company pursuant
to a statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the "Merger")
effected in part through the conversion of each outstanding share of 
------ capital stock of Company (the "Company Capital Stock"), into shares of
common  --------------------- stock of Parent (the "Parent Shares") at the
rate set forth in the Agreement and  ------------- Plan of Merger and
Reorganization dated as of May 16, 2001 by and among Parent, Merger Sub and
Company (such agreement as it may be amended or restated is hereinafter
referred to as the "Reorganization Agreement") (the "Transaction"); 
------------------------ -----------   WHEREAS, Shareholder is the
registered and beneficial owner of such number of shares of the outstanding
Company Capital Stock as is indicated on the signature page of this Agreement
(the "Shares"); and  ------   WHEREAS, in order to induce Parent to enter
into the Transaction, certain shareholders of Company have agreed not to
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, or any other shares of
Company Capital Stock acquired by such shareholder hereafter and prior to the
Expiration Date (as defined in Section 1.1 below), and have agreed to vote
the Shares and any other such shares of Company Capital Stock so as to
facilitate consummation of the Transaction.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the promises and mutual agreements, provisions and covenants
set forth in the Reorganization Agreement, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   1. Share Ownership and Agreement to Retain Shares. 
----------------------------------------------   1.1 Transfer and
Encumbrance.  ------------------------   (a) Shareholder represents,
warrants and, in subclause (v) below, covenants to Parent that (i)
Shareholder is the beneficial owner of that number of Shares of Company
Capital Stock set forth on the signature page hereto; (ii) except as
otherwise set forth on the signature page hereto, Shareholder has held such
Company Capital Stock at all times since the date set forth on such signature
page; (iii) the Shares constitute the Shareholder\'s entire equity interest
in the outstanding Company Capital Stock; (iv) no other person or entity not
a signatory to this Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a right to
acquire the Shares or any   portion of the Shares; and (v) the Shares are
and will be at all times up until the Expiration Date free and clear of any
liens, claims, rights of first refusal, options, charges or other
encumbrances. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall
deem shares of outstanding Company Capital Stock or options to acquire
Company Capital Stock held by an officer, director or employee of Shareholder
to be beneficially owned by Shareholder.   (b) Shareholder agrees not to
transfer (except as may be specifically required by court order or applicable
law), sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Shares
or any New Shares (as defined in Section 1.2 below), or to make any offer or
agreement relating thereto, at any time prior to the Expiration Date. As used
herein, the term "Expiration Date"  --------------- shall mean the earlier
to occur of (A) the Effective Time (as defined in the Reorganization
Agreement) of the Transaction, and (B) the termination of the Reorganization
Agreement pursuant to its terms.   1.2 New Shares. Shareholder agrees that
any shares of Company  ---------- Capital Stock that Shareholder purchases
or with respect to which Shareholder otherwise acquires beneficial ownership
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration Date ("New
Shares") shall be subject to the terms and  ---------- conditions of this
Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares.   2. Agreement
to Vote Shares. Prior to the Expiration Date, at every 
------------------------ meeting of the shareholders of Company called with
respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment thereof, and on
every action or approval by written resolution of the shareholders of Company
with respect to any of the following, Shareholder shall vote the Shares and
any New Shares in favor of approval of the Transaction and any matter or
actions required to facilitate the Transaction.   3. Irrevocable Proxy.
Shareholder is hereby delivering to Parent a duly 
----------------- executed proxy in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "Proxy") with  --------- ---------- respect to each meeting of
shareholders of Company, such Proxy to cover the total number of Shares and
New Shares in respect of which Shareholder is entitled to vote at any such
meeting. Upon the execution of this Agreement by the Shareholder, the
Shareholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies given by the Shareholder
with respect to the Shares and agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies
with respect to the Shares or any New Shares until after the Expiration
Date.   4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Shareholder.
Shareholder  -------------------------------------------------------- hereby
represents, warrants and/or covenants to Parent as follows:   (a) Until the
Expiration Date, the Shareholder will not (and will use such Shareholder\'s
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company, its affiliates,
officers, directors and employees and any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by such Shareholder, not to): (i) initiate
or solicit, directly or indirectly, any proposal, plan of offer to acquire
all or any substantial part of the business or properties or Company Capital
Stock, whether by merger, purchase of assets, tender offer or otherwise, or
to liquidate Company or otherwise distribute to the Shareholders of Company
all or any substantial part of the business, properties or Company Capital
Stock (each, an "Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) initiate, directly or 
-------------------- indirectly, any contact with any person in an effort to
or with a view towards   2   soliciting any Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
furnish information concerning Company\'s business, properties or assets to
any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, limited partnership,
person or other entity or group (other than Parent or Merger Sub, or any
associate, agent or representative of Parent or Merger Sub), under any
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to relate to an actual or
potential Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) negotiate or enter into discussions
or an agreement, directly or indirectly, with any entity or group with
respect of any potential Acquisition Proposal provided that, in the case of
clauses (iii) and (iv), the foregoing shall not prevent Shareholder, in
Shareholder\'s capacity as a director or officer (as the case may be)
of Company, from taking any actions permitted under Section 4.3 of
the Reorganization Agreement. In the event the Shareholder shall receive or
become aware of any Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date hereof,
such Shareholder shall promptly inform Parent as to any such matter and the
details thereof to the extent possible without breaching any other agreement
to which such Shareholder is a party or violating its fiduciary duties.  
(b) Shareholder is competent to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Shareholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Shareholder, enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with
its terms except that (i) the enforceability thereof may be subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws, now or
hereinafter in effect affecting creditors\' rights generally and (ii) the
availability of the remedy of specific performance or injunctive or other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and would be
subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought.   (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Shareholder does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Shareholder
shall not, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give
to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance, on any of the Shares
or New Shares pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement, commitment, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument
or obligation to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder or the
Shares or New Shares are or will be bound or affected.   5. Additional
Documents. Shareholder hereby covenants and agrees to 
-------------------- execute and deliver any additional documents necessary,
in the reasonable opinion of Parent, to carry out the purpose and intent of
this Agreement.   6. [Reserved].  ----------   7. Termination. This
Agreement and the Proxy delivered in  ----------- connection herewith shall
terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration
Date.   8. Confidentiality. Shareholder agrees (i) to hold any information 
--------------- regarding this Agreement and the Transaction in strict
confidence, and (ii) not to divulge any such information to any third person

required by law.   3    9. Miscellaneous.  -------------   9.1
Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or  ------------ restriction
of this Agreement or the Proxy is held by a court of competent jurisdiction

Company) and only with respect to the specific matters set forth herein.  
9.3 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be 
-------------------------- modified, amended, altered or supplemented except
by the execution and delivery of a written agreement executed by the parties
hereto.   9.4 Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto

violation of any of the covenants or agreements of Shareholder set forth
herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that

-----------------------------    May 16, 2001   Credence Systems
Corporation 215 Fourier Avenue Fremont, California 94539  Ladies and
Gentlemen:   The undersigned is a holder of shares of common stock (the
"Company Common Stock") of Integrated Measurement Systems, Inc., an Oregon
corporation (the "Company"). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 16, 2001, among the
Company, Credence Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"),
and Iguana Acquisition Corporation, an Oregon corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub will be merged with and into
the Company and the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
(the "Merger"). In connection with the Merger, the undersigned, as a holder
of Company Common Stock, will be entitled to receive shares of common stock
of Parent (the "Securities") in exchange for the shares of Company Common
Stock held by the undersigned at the effective time of the Merger.   The
undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of
Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and/or as such term is used
in and for purposes of Accounting Series Release Nos. 130 and 135,
as amended, of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"),
although nothing contained herein shall be construed as an admission of such
status.   If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate of the Company under
the Act, the undersigned\'s ability to sell, assign or transfer any
Securities received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered under the Act or an exemption from such
registration is available. The undersigned understands that such exemptions
are limited and the undersigned has obtained advice of counsel as to the
nature and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect
to the applicability to the sale of such Securities of Rules 144 and 145(d)
promulgated under the Act.   The undersigned hereby represents to and
covenants with Parent that it will not sell, assign or transfer any
Securities received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Act, (ii) by a sale made in conformity with
the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 (and otherwise in accordance
with Rule 144 under the Act, if the undersigned is an affiliate of Parent and
if so required at the time) or (iii) in a transaction which, in the opinion
of   independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company or as
described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the staff of the
Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be
registered under the Act.   The undersigned understands that Parent is under
no obligation to register the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
of the Securities by the undersigned or on behalf of the undersigned under
the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance
with an exemption from such registration available solely as a result of the
Merger.   In the event of a sale of Securities pursuant to Rule 145, upon
the request of Parent, the undersigned will supply Parent with evidence of
compliance with such Rule, in the form of customary seller\'s and broker\'s
Rule 145 representation letters or as Parent may otherwise reasonably
request. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its transfer
agent to withhold the transfer of any Securities disposed of by the
undersigned in a manner inconsistent with this letter.   The undersigned
acknowledges and agrees that appropriate legends will be placed on
certificates representing Securities received by the undersigned in the
Merger or held by a transferee thereof, which legends will be removed (i)
by delivery of substitute certificates upon receipt of a letter from the
Staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to the effect that such legends are no
longer required for the purposes of the Act and the rules and regulations of
the Commission promulgated thereunder, (ii) in the event of a sale of the
Securities which has been registered under the Act or made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145.   Parent covenants that, for so long as and to
the extent necessary to permit the undersigned to sell the shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144,
Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a timely
basis, all reports and data required to be filed with the Commission by it
pursuant to Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "1934 Act") and (ii) furnish to the undersigned upon request a written
statement as to whether Parent has complied with such reporting requirements
during the twelve (12) months preceding any proposed sale of the shares of
Parent Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145.   Parent represents
that it has filed all reports required with the Commission under Section 13
of the 1934 Act during the preceding twelve (12) months.   The undersigned
further represents to and convenants with Parent that, in the event that the
Merger may be accounted for as a pooling of interests, (i) the undersigned
has not and will not, during the 30 days prior to the effective time of the
Merger sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or reduce any risk relative
to, any securities of the Company or Parent and (ii) the undersigned will
not, after the effective time of the Merger, sell, transfer or
otherwise dispose of, or reduce any risk relative to, the Securities, whether
received by the undersigned in the Merger or otherwise, until after such time
as financial results covering at least 30 days of post-Merger operations of
Parent (including the combined operations of the Company and Parent) have
been published by Parent in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an
effective registration statement filed with the Commission, a report to the
Commission on Form 10-K, 10-Q or 8-K, or any other public filing or
announcement which includes such results of operations, except in the cases
of   clauses (i) and (ii) of this paragraph to the extent permitted by, and
in accordance with, SEC Accounting Series Release 135 and SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletins 65 and 76 if and to the extent that such release and
bulletins remain in full force and effect at the relevant time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Merger may not be
eligible to be accounted for as a pooling of interests, the covenants of the
undersigned in this paragraph shall cease and terminate.   The undersigned
further understand and agree that this letter agreement shall apply to all
shares of Company Common Stock and Securities that it is deemed to
beneficially own pursuant to applicable federal securities law.   The
undersigned acknowledges that it has carefully reviewed this letter
and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed upon
the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of
Securities.  Sincerely,   [AFFILIATE]   __________________________ Name: Title:   Acknowledged
