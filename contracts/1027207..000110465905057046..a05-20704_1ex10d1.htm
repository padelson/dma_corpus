under this Agreement, (b) otherwise identifies an event, occurrence, fact,
condition or Claim giving rise (or which may give rise) to a right of

or of the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity

promptly notify the party or parties obligated to provide indemnification or
from whom indemnification is being or will be sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") in writing of such Indemnity Claim (a "Claim Notice") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount
or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to
the provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim

give timely notice thereof shall not affect any of its rights to
indemnification hereunder nor relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.  Any Claim Notice not

Indemnified Party; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming
control of such defense it shall first (i) verify to the Indemnified Party in
writing that such Indemnifying Party shall be responsible (with no
reservation of any rights) for all liabilities and obligations relating to
such claim for indemnification and that it shall provide indemnification to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification
hereunder and (ii) provide the Indemnified Party with evidence (which
evidence may include the Stock Escrow Account) reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party that such Indemnifying Party will have the financial
resources to defend

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

### against such claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder.
The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such

arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation; (2) the claim primarily seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (3) the

failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim; provided

regarding such claims, including with respect to the selection and retention
of counsel, strategy regarding defending and resolving such claim
and implementation of such strategy.

  

### 

  

### (b) In the event the Indemnifying Party (i) exercises the right to
undertake the defense and investigation of any such Indemnity Claim as
provided in this Section 10.5, (A) the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost
and expense (other than any reasonable fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
effectively assumes control of such defense which, notwithstanding
the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party, and except that
the Indemnifying Party shall pay all of the reasonable fees and expenses of
such separate counsel in writing if the Indemnified Party has been
reasonably advised by its counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
), participate in the defense of such Indemnity Claim and (B) the
Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
efforts and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records,
materials and information in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s possession, under its
control or to which it may have access as may be reasonably required by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) fails to so assume the defense and investigation
of any such Indemnity Claim as provided in this Section 10.5, (A) the
Indemnified Party against which such Indemnity Claim has been asserted shall
have the right to undertake the defense and investigation of such Indemnity
Claim on behalf of, and at the cost and expense of and for the account and
risk of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ that no compromise or settlement
of such Indemnity Claim by such Indemnified Party shall be binding on the
Indemnifying Party unless the Indemnifying Party shall consent thereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (B) the
Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such
efforts.

  

### 

  

10.6 _Settlement of Indemnity Claims_. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise
any Indemnity Claim or consent to the entry of any final judgment which (a)
provides that any injunctive or other equitable relief be imposed against the
Indemnified Party or (ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff of an express, unconditional
written release or releases from all liability and obligations in respect of
such Indemnity Claim of all Indemnified Parties affected by such Indemnity
Claim with out prejudice. No Indemnity Claim that is being defended in good
faith by the Indemnifying Party shall be settled or compromised by
the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

10.7 _Materiality Qualifications_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement other than Section 3.23, for purposes of
the indemnification provisions in this Article X, the determination of (i)
whether any representation or warranty has been breached, and (ii) the amount
of any Losses with respect to any such breach, shall be made without giving
effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" qualification or any materiality
qualification contained in the representations or warranties herein.

  



  

10.8 _Exclusivity of Indemnification Remedy and Escrow_. After the
Closing has occurred, the indemnification provided in this Article X, shall

laws or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Article X, an Indemnifying Party shall have
no responsibility or obligation with respect to any claim for indemnification
asserted pursuant to this Article X unless such claim is asserted in writing
by the Indemnified Party prior to expiration of the applicable
indemnification obligation. Furthermore, the sole remedy of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)
which are subject to the Indemnification Cap shall be to claim payment under

right of Buyer to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for any breach or
threatened breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement, or (ii) impair
any claims based on fraud.

  



  

ARTICLE XI. _ 
  
 TAX MATTERS_

  



  

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between Buyer and Seller for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:

  



  

11.1 _Tax Indemnification_. (a) Seller shall indemnify the Company, the
Buyer and its Affiliates and hold them harmless from and against any loss,
claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to: (i) all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of the Company for all Taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing
Date for any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an
Affiliated Group of which the Company (or any predecessor of the foregoing)
is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Â§1.1502-6 (or any analogous or similar state, local, or
foreign law or regulation), and (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed
on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing; provided that, in the case of clause (i), (1)
solely with respect to any Taxable period ending on the Closing Date or the
portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, Seller shall only be liable
for Income Taxes to the extent such Income Taxes exceed the Closing Date Tax
Accrual (it being understood that, to the extent the Company is not able to
properly deduct Transaction Payments (other than as a result of the
application of Code Â§280G to such Transaction Payments) in computing taxable
income, Seller shall not be

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

liable for any increase in Income Taxes of the Company in such Taxable period
resulting therefrom but only up to an amount equal to the reduction in the
Closing Date Tax Accrual under Section 3.12(b) above resulting from taking
into account such Transaction Payments) and (2) Seller shall not be liable
for the matters set forth on _Schedule 11.1(a)_. The indemnification under
this Section 11.1 shall not be subject to the indemnification deductible and
limit set forth in Section 10 or elsewhere in this Agreement.
SellerÂ’s indemnification obligation with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall end when the applicable statutes of limitation with respect to
the liabilities in question expire (after giving effect to any extensions or
waivers thereof ), plus ninety (90) days. Seller shall reimburse Buyer
for any Taxes which are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this Section
11.1 at least 5 days prior to payment of such Taxes by Buyer or the Company.

  



  

### (b) In the case of any Taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income or receipts for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company holds
a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the
amount of other Taxes for a Straddle Period which relates to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.  For the avoidance
of doubt, neither the short taxable period of nMatrix Inc. for federal income
tax purposes ending on the Closing Date nor the short taxable period of
nMatrix Inc. beginning on the day following the Closing Date shall
be considered a Straddle Period.

  

### 

  

### (c) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim,
assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the Closing Date
in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit that results in an
increase in a Tax liability for which Seller is otherwise liable pursuant to
Section 11.1(a), and such change results in an actual decrease in the cash
Tax liability of the Buyer for the then current tax period of the Buyer, the
Company or any Affiliate or successor thereof, Seller shall not be
liable pursuant to Section 11.1(a) with respect to such increase to
the extent of such cash decrease (and, to the extent such increase in Tax
liability is paid to a Taxing Authority by Seller or any Affiliate thereof,
Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to such cash decrease.

  

### 

  

### (d) Buyer shall not file an actual election or take any action that could
result in a deemed election under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable
provision of state or local law or regulation) relating to the purchase of
stock of nMatrix U.S.

  

### 

  

11.2 _Tax Return Filing_.

  



  

### (a) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for Income Taxes with respect to the Company for
Straddle Periods and for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
the due date of which is after the Closing Date.  Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for Other
Taxes the due date of which is after the Closing Date. Buyer shall provide
Seller for

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

### SellerÂ’s review of such Tax Returns as soon as practicable, and in no
event less than 10 days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns. Buyer and
Seller shall discuss such Tax Return, consider any Seller comments with
respect thereto and negotiate any disagreement thereto in good faith.
 Seller shall remit to the Company within 5 days following agreement
with respect to such items any and all Taxes for which Sellers are otherwise
liable under Section 11.1(a).

  

### 

  

11.3 _Tax Indemnification Procedures; Contest Provisions_.

  



  

### (a) Each party shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon
receipt by such party or any of their respective Affiliates
or Representatives of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits, examinations, Claims or assessments (a " _Tax
Claim_ ") for which such party is entitled to seek, or is seeking or intends
to seek, indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1; _provided_ , _however_
, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the failure to
give such notice materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

  

### 

  

### (b) (i) Seller shall have the right, at its own expense, to control and
to represent the interests of the Company in and with respect to any Tax
Claim for any Pre-Closing Tax Period for which it is solely liability under
Section 11.1(a), and to employ counsel of its own choice for such purpose;
provided that, Seller shall have the sole right to control and conduct the
Tax Claim only if (i) the Seller notifies the Buyer in writing within fifteen
(15) days after the Buyer has given notice of the Tax Claim or Seller is
otherwise notified of such Tax Claim that the Seller will indemnify the Buyer
and the Company from and against any loss, claim, liability, expense, other
damages, and Taxes in accordance Section 11.1(a) such party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Tax Claim (whether or not otherwise required hereunder and with no
reservation of rights), (ii) the Seller provides the Buyer with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer that the Seller will have the financial
resources to defend against the Tax Claim and fulfill its indemnification
obligations hereunder, (iii) the Tax Claim involves only money damages, and
does not relate to or arise in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action, indictment, allegation or investigation and (iv) such Tax Claim could
not materially affect Buyer or the Company with respect to taxable years or
periods or portions thereof beginning or ending after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall keep Buyer informed of any
material developments in such Tax Claim, shall consult in good faith with
Buyer with respect to such Tax Claim, shall permit Buyer to review all
material written submissions with respect to such Tax Claim and afford Buyer
and counsel of its own choosing the right to participate at BuyerÂ’s expense
in the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim. Seller shall have the sole
right to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any proceeding relating to such Tax Claims which it is in sole
control of; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not settle any Tax
Claim described in this Section 11.3(b) without prior written consent of
Buyer.

  

### 

  

#### (ii) Except as otherwise provided by Section 11.3(b), Buyer shall have
the sole right to control all Tax Claims relating to the Company; _provided_
, _however_ , that Buyer shall consult in good faith with Seller with respect
to the contest of a Straddle Period Tax Claim for which Seller is liable
under _Section 11.1(a)_, shall permit Seller to review all material written
submissions with respect to such Straddle Period Tax Claim, and shall afford
Seller or counsel of its own choosing the right to participate, at SellerÂ’s
expense, in the prosecution or defense of such

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

#### Straddle Period Tax Claim; and provided further, that Buyer shall not
settle any such Straddle Period Tax Claim without prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

####

one hand, and Buyer and the Company, on the other hand, shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to):

otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports with respect to Taxes

### 

  

### (h) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar

reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein unless the deletion of such provisions or provisions
would result in such a material change as to cause completion of the

been set forth in their entirety herein. Buyer acknowledges that the
disclosure or inclusion of any specific agreement, document,
instrument, report, item, fact or event by Seller or the Company in the

Representatives that such agreement, document, instrument, report, item, fact
or event is material to the Seller, the business or to the Company or their
financial condition, businesses, operations, liabilities, assets or
properties or would constitute a Material Adverse Effect. Buyer shall not use
the fact of any disclosure or inclusion of any such agreement,
document, instrument, report, item, fact or event in the Disclosure Schedule

included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement.

  



  

12.9 _Reasonable Consent Required_. Where any provision of this
Agreement requires a party to obtain the consent, approval or other
acquiescence of any other party, such consent, approval or other acquiescence

41   

     
   

  



  

12.10 Waivers.  Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the
time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit thereof. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time
any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any
part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

  



  

12.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LAWS THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE

agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,

action or proceeding in any such New York state or Federal court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Each party to this
Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in Section 12.2.  Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right
