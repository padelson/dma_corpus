   | 4.4| Equitable  Relief 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The parties agree that irreparable harm will occur for which money damages

understandings herein solely in its capacity as a securityholder of Mountain
and the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed or interpreted to
bind the Securityholder or any of its affiliates, directors or officers in
his or her capacity as a director or officer of Mountain or any of its
Subsidiaries. For greater certainty, nothing herein shall restrict any
person from taking in good faith any actions, or in any way limit any
actions that a person may take, necessary to discharge such person's
fiduciary duties as a director or officer of Mountain or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



   | 4.6| Waiver;  Amendment

writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Securityholder and
KDI or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to
be effective and no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall

   | 4.9| Severability 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement or its application
to any Party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or unenforceable,
such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the
extent of such restriction, prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement and without
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction or without affecting its application to other parties or
circumstances. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



   | 4.10| Successors  and Assigns 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted
assigns and legal personal representatives, provided that no party may
assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto, except that KDI may assign, delegate or
otherwise transfer any of its rights, interests or obligations under this
Agreement to an Affiliate without reducing its own obligations hereunder
without the consent of the Securityholder.

   | 4.11| Expenses 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each party shall pay all costs and expenses (including the fees and
disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers) it incurs in connection
with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   | 4.12| Independent  Legal Advice 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Each of the parties hereby acknowledges that it has been afforded the
opportunity to obtain independent legal advice and confirms by the execution
of this Agreement that they have either done so or waived their right to do so
in connection with the entering into of this Agreement.

   | 4.13| Further  Assurances 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The parties hereto shall, with reasonable diligence, do all things and
provide all such reasonable assurances as may be required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each party shall
provide such further documents or instruments required by the other party as
may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of this
Agreement and carry out its provisions, whether before or after the Effective
Time.

  



   | 4.14| Execution  and Delivery 
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement may be executed by the parties in counterparts and may be
executed and delivered by facsimile and all the counterparts and facsimiles
