vii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND SCHEME OF ARRANGEMENT, dated as
of September 4, 2000 (referred to herein as the "date hereof"), by and
among National Grid Group plc., a public limited company incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales with registration number 2367004 ("Parent"),
Niagara Mohawk Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation (the "Company"), New
National Grid Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws
of England and Wales with registration number 4031152 ("Newco") and Grid
Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco
("Merger Sub").   WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Newco have determined
that it would be in their respective best interests and in the interests of
their respective shareholders to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent intends to recommend
to its shareholders a proposal to introduce Newco as a new holding company
for the Parent group pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the "Scheme") to be
sanctioned by the High Court of Justice, London, England (the "Court"),
substantially in the form of the draft Scheme attached hereto as Exhibit A
subject to such amendments as Parent may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable; provided, that if such amendments would have a material adverse
effect on the benefits of the Merger for the holders of Company Common Stock,
or such amendments are not necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and have any adverse effect on the benefits of the Merger
to the holders of Company Common Stock, such amendments may only be effected
with the prior written consent of the Company;   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of Parent, Newco, Merger Sub and the Company have
approved the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
whereby the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco, all
pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; and  
WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Scheme together with the Merger shall collectively qualify as
a transaction described in Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:    ARTICLE I   THE MERGER AND THE SCHEME   Section 1.1 The
Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Merger
Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the     Company
in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York (the
"BCL") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL").
The Company will be the surviving entity in the Merger (the
"Surviving Entity") and shall continue its existence under the laws of the
State of New York. The effects and the consequences shall be as set forth in
Section 1.5, Section 906 of the BCL and Section 259 of the DGCL.   Section
1.2 Effective Time of the Merger. On the Closing Date (as defined in Section
3.1) a certificate of merger complying with the requirements of the relevant
provisions of the BCL shall be executed and delivered for filing with the
Department of State of the State of New York with respect to the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective upon the later of the filing of a certificate
of merger relating thereto by the Department of State of the State of New
York and the filing of a certificate of merger relating thereto with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or upon such later date as is
agreed upon by the parties and specified in such certificates of merger (the
"Merger Effective Time"); provided that the Merger Effective Time shall occur
as soon as reasonably practical but no later than seven days after the Scheme
Effective Time (as defined below).   Section 1.3 The Scheme. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Scheme having been sanctioned
by the Court and having become effective in accordance with Section 1.4, on
the Scheme Effective Time, all of the issued and outstanding share capital of
Parent shall be cancelled and Parent shall issue and deliver to Newco such
number of the Parent Ordinary Shares as has been so cancelled in
consideration of the allotment by Newco of such number of Newco shares as
shall be of an aggregate nominal amount equal to the aggregate nominal amount
of the Parent Ordinary Shares so cancelled.   Section 1.4 The Scheme
Effective Time. This Scheme shall become effective as soon as an office copy
of the Court order sanctioning this Scheme has been duly delivered to the
Registrar of Companies for registration and the order and relative minutes
have been registered by him (such time being referred to herein as the
"Scheme Effective Time"); provided that the Scheme Effective Time shall occur
prior to the Merger Effective Time.   Section 1.5 Governing Documents. The
memorandum and articles of association of Parent as in effect immediately
prior to the Scheme Effective Time shall be the memorandum and articles of
association of Parent following the Scheme Effective Time, until duly
amended, except that the memorandum and articles of association of Parent
following the Scheme Effective Time may reflect a change in the name of
Parent and such other changes as are appropriate for Parent as a wholly owned
subsidiary and any changes necessary to reflect any cancellations or
redemption of the Parent Special Share (as defined in Section 2.1) pursuant
to the Scheme or otherwise. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall
be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company following the
Merger Effective Time, until duly amended. On or prior to the Closing Date,
Newco shall adopt memorandum and articles of association substantially
similar to the memorandum and articles of incorporation of Parent immediately
prior to the Scheme Effective Time, though they shall not be required to (but
may) provide for a   2   Newco Special Share (as defined in Section 2.1)
and Newco\'s name shall become "National Grid plc".    ARTICLE II  
TREATMENT OF SHARES   Section 2.1 Effect of the Scheme on Parent Capital
Stock. As of the Scheme Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the
Scheme (a) all ordinary shares of 11 13/17 pence each of Parent ("Parent
Ordinary Shares") outstanding on the Scheme Effective Time will be cancelled
and the holders thereof will receive in place of the Parent Ordinary Shares
then held by them an identical number of ordinary shares of Newco ("Newco
Ordinary Shares"), (b) all Parent Ordinary Shares represented by American
Depositary Shares of Parent ("Parent ADSs"), each representing five (5)
Parent Ordinary Shares and evidenced by American Depositary Receipts ("Parent
ADRs"), outstanding as of the Scheme Effective Time will be cancelled and the
holders thereof will receive in place of the Parent ADSs then held by them an
identical number of American Depositary Shares of Newco ("Newco ADSs"), each
representing five (5) Newco Ordinary Shares and evidenced by American
Depositary Receipts ("Newco ADRs"), (c) Parent will issue and deliver Parent
Ordinary Shares to Newco, and (d) if required by the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry in the UK as a condition of giving its consent to the
Scheme, the Special Rights Redeemable Preference Share of Parent with a
nominal value of L held by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in
the UK (the "Parent Special Share") shall be cancelled and one Special
Rights Redeemable Preference Share of Newco with a nominal value of L shall
be issued by Newco to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the UK
(the "Newco Special Share").   Section 2.2 Effect of the Merger on the
Company Capital Stock. As of the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Common
Stock (as hereinafter defined):   (a) Conversion of Merger Sub Shares. Each
share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time will be converted
into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock").   (b) Cancellation of Company Treasury Stock
and Sub-Owned Stock. Each Share of Company Common Stock, that is owned by the
Company, Parent or Newco or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company,
Parent or Newco, will automatically be canceled, retired and cease to exist,
and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c)
Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the other provisions of this
Section 2.2, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with
Section 2.2(b)) will be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Amount (as defined below) in the form of   3   (x) cash (in such form,
the "Cash Consideration"), (y) a number of Newco ADSs equal to the Exchange
Ratio (in such form, the "ADS Consideration"), or (z) a combination of Cash
Consideration and ADS Consideration determined in accordance with Section
2.2(h) (the "Merger Consideration"). The "Per Share Amount" shall be
determined as follows: (i) if the Average Price is greater than or equal
to $32.50 and less than or equal to $51.00, the Per Share Amount shall be
$19.00, (ii) if the Average Price is less than $32.50, the Per Share Amount
shall be $19.00 reduced by the product of (x) $12.67 (two-thirds of $19.00)
and (y) the percentage decrease in the Average Price below $32.50, and (iii)
if the Average Price is greater than $51.00, the Per Share Amount shall be
$19.00 increased by the product of (x) $12.67 (two-thirds of $19.00) and (y)
the percentage increase in the Average Price above $51.00. "Average Price"
means the average of the closing prices of Parent Ordinary Shares, as derived
from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange plc (converted to a
U.S. dollar value using the exchange rate for each date for which the closing
price is to be determined as reported in The Financial Times) for 20 Trading
Days selected at random (using procedures mutually agreed upon by Parent and
the Company) in the period of 40 consecutive Trading Days ending on the close
of business on the tenth Trading Day prior to the Election Deadline,
multiplied by five. "Trading Day" means a day on which the London Stock
Exchange plc is open for trading. The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the
Per Share Amount as determined above divided by the Average Price.   (d)
Cash Election. Subject to the immediately following sentence, each record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive Cash
Consideration for all or any part of such Company Common Stock (a "Cash
Election"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of Cash
Consideration to be paid in the Merger shall be $1,015,000,000 (the "Cash
Amount"). As used in this Agreement, the "Cash Election Number" shall mean
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger, which shall equal the Cash
Amount divided by the Per Share Amount; provided that Newco reserves the
right in its sole discretion to increase the Cash Election Number to more
closely follow the actual elections of the Company\'s shareholders (but not
to a number which is greater than the number of shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which a valid Cash Election has been made).   (e) Cash
Election Shares. If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
covered by the Cash Elections (the "Cash Election Shares") exceeds the Cash
Election Number, (1) the number of Cash Election Shares covered by each Form
of Election (defined below) will be determined by multiplying the number
of Cash Election Shares covered by such Form of Election by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the Cash Election Number and the denominator of
which is the number of Cash Election Shares, and (2) all Cash Election Shares
not exchanged for Cash Consideration will be exchanged for the right to
receive ADS Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.3(e))   (f) ADS Election. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, each record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be entitled
to elect to receive ADS Consideration for all or any part of such holder\'s
shares   4   of Company Common Stock (an "ADS Election"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that
may be converted into the right to receive ADS Consideration in the Merger
(the "ADS Election Number") shall be the difference between the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time and the Cash Election Number.   (g) ADS Election
Shares. If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by
ADS Elections (the "ADS Election Shares") exceeds the ADS Election Number,
(1) the number of ADS Election Shares covered by each Form of Election
(defined below) to be exchanged for Cash Consideration will be determined by
multiplying the number of ADS Election Shares covered by such Form of
Election by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Election
Number less the number of Cash Election Shares and the denominator of which
is the aggregate number of ADS Election Shares, and (2) all ADS Election
Shares not exchanged for Cash Consideration will be exchanged for the right
to receive ADS Consideration (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.3(e)).   (h) Mixed Election. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, each record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be entitled
to elect to receive ADS Consideration for part of such holder\'s shares of
Company Common Stock and Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such
holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock (the "Mixed Election" and,
collectively with ADS Election and Cash Election, the "Election"). With
respect to each holder of Company Common Stock who makes a Mixed Election,
the shares of Company Common Stock such holder elects to be converted into
the right to receive Cash Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election
Shares for purposes of the provisions contained in Sections 2.2(d) and (e),
and the shares such holder elects to be converted into the right to
receive ADS Consideration shall be treated as ADS Election Shares for
purposes of the provisions contained in Sections 2.2(f) and (g).   (i) Non-
Election Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which a timely
and properly completed election has not been made (the "Non-Election Shares")
shall be deemed by Newco to be Cash Election Shares or ADS Election Shares,
as Newco shall determine.   Section 2.3 Exchange of Certificates.   (a)
Scheme Exchange. The exchange of certificates representing Parent Ordinary
Shares and Parent ADRs in the Scheme shall occur substantially in accordance
with the provisions of Exhibit A hereto.   (b) Appointment of ADR Depositary
for Merger Exchange. As of the Merger Effective Time, Newco and Merger Sub
will enter into an agreement ("ADR Depositary Agreement") with Newco\'s
United States Depositary (the "ADR Depositary"), which will provide that
Newco or Merger Sub will deposit with the ADR Depositary as of the Merger
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the ADR
Depositary, cash equal to the sum of the total   5   aggregate Cash
Consideration and the number of Newco Ordinary Shares represented by the
Newco ADSs to be issued in the Merger (such cash and such Newco
ADSs, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with
a record date after the Merger Effective Time and any cash payable in lieu of
any fractional Newco ADSs, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund") pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock.   (c) Merger Exchange Procedures.   (i) Not more
than 90 days nor fewer than 30 days prior to  the Closing Date, the ADR
Depositary will mail a form of election (the  "Form of Election") to holders
of record of shares of Company Common Stock  (as of a record date as close as
practicable to the date of mailing and  mutually agreed to by the Company,
Newco and Parent). In addition, the ADR  Depositary will use its best efforts
to make the Form of Election available  to the persons (as defined in Section
2.3(g)) who become shareholders of  the Company during the period between
such record date and the Closing  Date. Any election to receive Merger
Consideration contemplated by Section  2.2(c) will have been properly made
only if the ADR Depositary shall have  received at its designated office or
offices, by 5:00 p.m., New York City  time, on the fifth business day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the  "Election Deadline"), a Form of
Election properly completed and accompanied  by a Company Share Certificate
("Certificate(s)") for the shares to which  such Form of Election relates,
duly endorsed in blank or otherwise  acceptable for transfer on the books of
the Company (or an appropriate  guarantee of delivery), as set forth in such
Form of Election. An election  may be revoked only by written notice received
by the ADR Depositary prior  to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
Election Deadline. In addition,  all elections shall automatically be revoked
if the ADR Depositary is  notified in writing by Newco, Parent and the
Company that the Merger has  been abandoned. If an election is so revoked,
the Certificate(s) (or  guarantee of delivery, as appropriate) to which such
election relates will  be promptly returned to the person submitting the same
to the ADR  Depositary. Newco shall have the discretion, which it may
delegate in whole  or in part to the ADR Depositary, to determine whether
Forms of Election  have been properly completed, signed and submitted or
revoked pursuant to  this Article II, and to disregard immaterial defects in
Forms of Election.  The decision of Newco (or the ADR Depositary) in such
matters shall be  conclusive and binding.   (ii) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Merger  Effective Time, the ADR Depositary will mail to
each holder of record of a  Certificate, whose shares of the Company Common
Stock (the "Shares") were  converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration and who failed to  return a properly completed Form of
Election, (i) a letter of transmittal  (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and  title to the Certificates will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates  to the ADR Depositary and will be in such
form and have such other  provisions as Newco, Parent and the Company may
specify consistent with  this Agreement) and (ii) instructions for use in  
6    effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger  Consideration determined by Newco pursuant to Section 2.2(i).  
(iii) At the Merger Effective Time, with respect to properly  made elections
in accordance with Section 2.3(c)(i), and upon surrender in  accordance with
Section 2.3(c)(ii) of a Certificate for cancellation to the  ADR Depositary
or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by  Newco, Parent and
the Company, together with such letter of transmittal,  duly executed, and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by  the ADR Depositary,
the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to  receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has  the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the  Certificate so
surrendered will forthwith be canceled. In the event of a  transfer of
ownership of Shares that are not registered in the transfer  records of the
Company, payment may be issued to a person other than the  person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such  Certificate is
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer  and the person
requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other taxes  required by reason
of such payment to a person other than the registered  holder of such
Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of Newco,  Parent and the
Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate  will be deemed at any
time after the Merger Effective Time to represent  only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that  the holder thereof has the
right to receive in respect of such Certificate  pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II. No interest will be paid or  will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the  provisions of this
Article II.   (d) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to the Newco ADSs with a record
date after the Merger Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Newco ADSs represented thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(e), and all such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional Newco ADSs shall be paid by
Newco to the ADR Depositary and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. Subject to the effect of unclaimed property, escheat and other
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the holder of the Certificate representing whole Newco ADSs issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Newco ADS to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Newco ADSs and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
whole Newco ADSs. Newco shall make available to the ADR Depositary cash for
the foregoing purposes.   (e) No Fractional Securities. No Newco
Certificates or scrip representing fractional Newco ADSs shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such   7   fractional
shares shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of
a holder of Newco ADSs or Newco Ordinary Shares. A holder of Shares converted
in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional Newco
ADS shall be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest) in lieu of
such fractional share in an amount determined by multiplying (i)
the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled by (ii) the closing price per Parent ADS as reported on the NYSE
Composite Transaction Tape on the Closing Date.   (f) No Further Ownership
Rights in Company Common Stock. All Newco ADSs issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II
(including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to any
obligation of Newco or the Surviving Entity to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Merger Effective Time
which may have been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock that remain unpaid at the Merger Effective Time, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time. If, after the
Merger Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Newco, the Surviving
Entity or the ADR Depositary for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.3, except as otherwise provided by
law.   (g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six
months after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered by the ADR
Depositary to Newco, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Newco
for payment of their claim for such Newco ADSs or funds to which such holder
may be due, subject to applicable law. None of Newco, Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Entity or the ADR Depositary shall be liable to any person (as
defined below) in respect of any such Newco ADSs or funds from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. As used in this Agreement, the term
"person" shall mean any natural person, corporation, general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or
entity of any kind.   (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The ADR Depositary
will invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Newco, on
a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
will be paid to Newco.   (i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Newco or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, the posting by
such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Newco or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the ADR Depositary
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  
8   Certificate the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and distributions on Newco
ADSs, pursuant to this Agreement.   (j) Certain Adjustments. If, after the
date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date, the outstanding Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs shall be changed into a different number of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, issue by
capitalization of reserves, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
rights issue, or any dividend payable in stock or other securities is
declared thereon with a record date within such period, or any similar event
shall occur, the Merger Consideration will be adjusted accordingly to provide
to the holders of the Company Common Stock, the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
reclassification, recapitalization, issue by capitalization of reserves,
split-up, combination, exchange, rights issue or dividend or similar
event.   (k) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Entity and Newco
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of the Company
Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law, other than Conveyance Taxes (as defined in
Section 7.14). To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Entity or Newco, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of the Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Newco, as the case may
be.    ARTICLE III   THE CLOSING   Section 3.1 Closing. The closing of
the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of LeBoeuf, Lamb,
Greene and MacRae, L.L.P., 125 West 55th Street, New York, New York 10019 at
10:00 A.M., local time, on the business day that is no later than the first

hereof is fulfilled or waived, or at such other time, date and place as the

director or employee of Parent (each an "Indemnified Party" and collectively,
the "Indemnified Parties") against (i) all losses, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or,
subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in
settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Merger Effective Time or the Scheme Effective Time, as the case may be
(and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Merger Effective

of such insurance coverage or (ii) provide tail coverage for such persons

successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or

and assigns of Newco shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.5 and in Sections 7.8 and 7.9.   46    (d) Survival of Indemnification.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) from and after the Merger

respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to, issue or cause the publication
of any press release or make any other public announcement with respect to
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the
prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Newco, Parent and the Company will cooperate with each
other in the development and distribution of all press releases and other
public announcements with respect to the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby, and will furnish the other with drafts of any such
releases and announcements as far in advance as practicable.   Section 7.7
Rule 145 Affiliates. Within 30 days after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall identify in a letter to Newco all persons who are, and to such
person\'s best knowledge who will be at the Closing Date, "affiliates" of the
Company, as the case may be, as such term is used in Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its affiliates (including any person who may be deemed to have become
such an affiliate after the date of the letter referred to in the
prior sentence) to deliver to Newco on or prior to the Closing Date a
written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit 7.7 (each, an
"Affiliate Agreement").   47    Section 7.8 Labor Agreements and
Workforce Matters.   (a) Labor Agreements. Newco shall honor or cause the
appropriate subsidiary to honor all collective bargaining agreements in
effect as of the Merger Effective Time until their expiration, and shall
assume all of the rights and obligations provided under such collective
bargaining agreements.   (b) Workforce Matters. Subject to applicable law
and obligations under applicable collective bargaining agreements, for a
period of two years following the Merger Effective Time, reductions in
workforce, if any, in respect of U.S. employees of Newco and its Subsidiaries
shall be made on a fair and equitable basis as determined by Newco, and any
employee whose employment is terminated or job is eliminated during such
period shall be entitled to participate on a fair and equitable basis as
determined by Newco in the job opportunity and employment placement programs
offered by Newco or any of its Subsidiaries for U.S. employees for which they
are eligible. Workforce reductions, if any, carried out following the Merger
Effective Time by the Surviving Entity shall be done in accordance with all
applicable collective bargaining agreements, and all laws and regulations
governing the employment relationship and termination thereof including,
without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable state or
local law.   Section 7.9 Employee Benefit Plans; Stock Options.   (a) For
a period of two years immediately following the Closing Date, the
compensation, benefits and coverage provided to current employees
and retirees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than those
covered by a collective bargaining agreement, who continue employment with
Newco or one of its Subsidiaries (the "Affected Employees") pursuant to
compensation and employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Newco
or one of its Subsidiaries shall be, in the aggregate, not less favorable (as
determined by Newco and the Surviving Entity using reasonable assumptions and
benefit valuation methods) than those provided, in the aggregate, to such
Affected Employees by the Company and any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Newco shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its other Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms and
applicable law (i) all compensation, benefit, and funding obligations as in
effect as of the date hereof or as may later be in effect in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement to current and former officers of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, and to their beneficiaries, that are described in any
applicable employment agreement or other Company Employee Benefit Plan
(including, but not limited to, the Company\'s Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and that are
accrued, owed or mutually agreed to on or before the Merger Effective Time as
set forth in Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) all
other obligations to Affected Employees and current and former directors of
the Company and any Company Subsidiary, and to their beneficiaries, under
employment, severance, consulting and retention agreements or arrangements
and all Company Employee Benefit Plans that are accrued, owed or mutually
agreed to on or before the Merger Effective Time, as set forth in Section
4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In addition to the foregoing,
Newco shall   48   and shall cause the Surviving Entity or its other
Subsidiaries to pay any Affected Employees whose employment is terminated by
Newco, the Surviving Entity or other Subsidiary within 24 months of the
Closing Date, a severance benefit package equivalent to the severance-related
benefits in effect under the following Company plans and programs as of the
effective date hereof (subject to the modification described in the following
(i)): (i) the Niagara Mohawk Involuntary Severance Plan (Section 1.9 of the
Niagara Mohawk Involuntary Severance Plan shall be amended prior to the
Merger Effective Date to provide that a job offer by Newco or one of its
Subsidiaries shall not prevent an involuntarily terminated Affected Employee
from receiving severance benefits under such Plan if such job offer is for
employment that is more than fifty miles one-way from the Affected
Employee\'s work location at the time of such involuntary termination); (ii)
the Niagara Mohawk Medical and Prescription Drug Plan For Eligible
Participants In the Involuntary Severance Plan; and (iii) the "Career Center"
and "Reimbursement For Job Training Educational Expenses" benefits described
in the Company\'s "Transition Benefits" summary that describes transition
benefits for eligible management employees whose jobs are abolished as a
direct result of the Company\'s restructuring efforts.   (b) The
compensation, benefits and coverage provided to employees who are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement described in Section 7.8(a) shall be
provided subject to the terms of such collective bargaining agreement.   (c)
Newco shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give the Affected Employees
full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual (including,
without limitation, benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans)
and determination of the level of benefits under any employee benefit or
fringe benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Newco or one of its
Subsidiaries for such Affected Employees\' service with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (or any prior employer) to the same extent recognized
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing
Date, except where such credit would provide duplication of benefits. With
respect to any employee benefit plan or arrangement established by Newco or
one of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (the "Post-Closing Plans")
that is not intended to replace any Company benefit for Affected Employees in
existence immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, service shall be
credited in accordance with the terms of such Post-Closing Plans consistent
with the crediting of service for employees of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries
who participate in such plan or arrangement.   (d) Newco shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare
benefit plan of Newco or its Subsidiaries in which such Affected Employees
may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date, other than limitations
or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such Affected
Employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Closing Date under any
welfare benefit plan maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare
benefit plans that such Affected Employees are eligible to participate in
after the Closing Date.    49    (e) Except as may be limited by any
applicable law or collective bargaining agreement, Newco and its Subsidiaries
shall neither be required to or prevented from merging the Company\'s benefit
plans, agreements, or arrangements into Newco or its Subsidiaries benefit
plans, agreements, or arrangements or from replacing the Company\'s benefit
plans, agreements or arrangements with Newco or its Subsidiaries benefit
plans, agreements or arrangements.   (f) At the Merger Effective Time each
stock option outstanding pursuant to the Company\'s 1992 Stock Option Plan
(the "Option"), whether or not then exercisable, shall be canceled and shall
only entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount in cash from the Company
equal to the result of multiplying (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously subject to such Option by (ii) the excess of the Cash
Consideration over the per Share exercise price of such Option. The Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to take all action necessary to effectuate
the foregoing provision.   Section 7.10 No Solicitations. (a) From and after
the date hereof, the Company (i) shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Representatives
to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by
way of furnishing information), or take any other action designed to
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal (including,
without limitation, any offer or proposal to its shareholders) which
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
(as defined herein) from any third party or (B) engage in any discussions or
negotiations or furnish any confidential information or data to any person or
group relating to any Acquisition Proposal and (ii) shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties with respect to any Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the date on which
the Company Shareholders\' Approval has been obtained (the "Applicable
Period"), the Board of Directors of the Company (A) determines in good faith,
based upon the written opinion of outside counsel that such Board\'s
fiduciary duties under applicable law with respect to the Acquisition
Proposal require it to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company shareholders under applicable law and (B)
concludes in good faith based on the written advice of its financial advisors
that the person or group making such Acquisition Proposal has adequate
sources of financing to consummate such Acquisition Proposal and that such
Acquisition Proposal, if consummated as proposed, is materially more
favorable to the Company shareholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger, the Company may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal which was not
solicited by it or which did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 7.10(a), and subject to providing prior written notice of its
decision to take such action to Parent in compliance with Section 7.10(b),
(x) furnish to such third party information with respect to itself and its
business, properties and assets pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement on terms not in the aggregate materially more favorable to such
third party than the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y)
engage in discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal. As
used herein, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer (other
than by another party hereto) for a tender or exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any of
its material Subsidiaries or any proposal to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, 10% or   50   more of the shares of capital stock in or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company or any of its material
Subsidiaries.   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.10,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or
this Agreement, (ii) fail to reaffirm such approval or recommendation upon
Parent\'s request, (iii) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(iv) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that during the Applicable Period
the Board of Directors of the Company (i) determines in good faith based upon
the written opinion of outside counsel that such Board\'s fiduciary duties
under applicable law with respect to the Acquisition Proposal require, to do
so in order to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company shareholders and (ii) concludes in good faith based on the written
advice of its financial advisors that the person or group making
such Acquisition Proposal has adequate sources of financing to consummate
such Acquisition Proposal and that such Acquisition Proposal, if consummated
as proposed, is materially more favorable to the Company shareholders from
a financial point of view than the Merger, such Board of Directors may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) (and concurrently with or
after such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into any
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal), but only at
a time that is (x) during the Applicable Period and is after the fifth
business day following receipt by Parent of written notice advising Parent
that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared to accept an
Acquisition Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and identifying the person making such Acquisition
Proposal, (y) after the Company and its respective financial and legal
advisors have given Parent a reasonable opportunity during such five-day
period following receipt by Parent of such written notice to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the
Company to proceed with the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby
on such adjusted terms, and (z) after the Company and such advisors have
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any such adjustments;
provided that the Company\'s ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(e) is conditioned upon the concurrent payment by the Company to
Parent of any amounts owed by it pursuant to Section 9.3(c).   (c) In
addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 7.10, the Company shall immediately advise Parent orally
and in writing of any request for information or of any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal and
the identity of the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent informed of the status and details (including
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or Acquisition
Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.10 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith   51   judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable law.   Section 7.11 Boards of Directors.   (a) Newco
Board. Newco shall take such action as may be necessary to appoint (i) all
members serving on the Parent Board of Directors immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) the current Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
(iii) one additional person presently serving as an outside director of the
Board of Directors of the Company on the date hereof, as determined
by Parent, to serve on the Newco Board of Directors following the Effective
Time.   (b) Advisory Board. Promptly following the Merger Effective Time,
Newco shall cause the Surviving Entity to establish an advisory board (the
"New York Advisory Board") which shall be maintained for at least two years
and which shall be comprised of up to 12 persons who were, immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time, serving as non-executive members of the
Company\'s Board of Directors, who are not appointed to serve on Newco Board
of Directors and who are willing to serve in such capacity on the New York
Advisory Board. The function of the New York Advisory Board shall be to
advise the Surviving Entity\'s Board of Directors with respect to general
business as well as opportunities and activities in the State of New York and
to maintain and develop customer relationships in the State of New York. The
New York Advisory Board shall meet no less frequently than three times a
year. The members of the New York Advisory Board shall each be named to serve
as members thereof for a period of two years; provided, however, that Newco
shall have no obligation to cause the Surviving Entity to elect or appoint,
and may cause the Surviving Entity to remove, any member of the New York
Advisory Board if Newco reasonably determines that such member has a conflict
of interest that compromises such member\'s ability to serve effectively as a
member of the New York Advisory Board or any cause exists that otherwise
would allow for removal of such person as a director of the Surviving Entity
if such person were a member of the Surviving Entity\'s Board of
Directors.   (c) National Grid USA Board. For a period of two years
commencing at the Effective Time, the current Chief Executive Officer of the
Company shall serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of National Grid
USA and two other current executive officers of the Company as determined by
Parent will serve on the Board of Directors of National Grid USA.   Section
7.12 Charitable Contributions. The parties agree that provision of charitable
contribution and community support within the region served by the Company
serves a number of important goals. After the Merger Effective Time, Newco
intends to cause the Surviving Entity to provide charitable contributions and
community support within the region served by the Company at annual
levels substantially comparable to the annual level of charitable
contributions and community support provided, directly or indirectly, by the
Company and its public utility subsidiary within the region served by the
Company during 1999.    52    Section 7.13 Anti-Takeover Statutes. If
any "fair price," "moratorium," "business combination," "control share
acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby,
each of Parent and the Company and the members of their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions consistent with
their fiduciary duties and in accordance with applicable law as are
reasonably necessary so that the Merger and such other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 7.14 Conveyance Taxes. The
Company, Parent and Newco shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees, and any similar Taxes ("Conveyance Taxes") which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required or permitted to be paid on or before the Merger Effective
Time. Newco shall pay, without deduction or withholding from any amount
payable to the holders of any shares of the Company Common Stock, any such
Conveyance Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of the shareholders of the
Company.   Section 7.15 Expenses. Subject to Section 9.3, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses,
except that those expenses incurred in connection with printing the
Proxy/Registration Statement, the filing fee relating to the
Proxy/Registration Statement and for expert witnesses retained for the
purpose of advising and supporting approvals where both Company and Parent
have filed for approval from the same regulator, shall be shared equally by
the Company and Parent.   Section 7.16 Further Assurances. Each party shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, execute such further documents and
instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be requested by
any other party in order to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms hereof. Parent and Newco shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, execute such further documents and instruments and take such
further actions as may reasonably be requested by any other party in order to
consummate the Scheme in accordance with the terms hereof, provided that
Parent and Newco may amend the terms of the Scheme as they deem reasonably
necessary or desirable, provided further that if any such amendment would
have a material adverse effect on the benefits of the Merger to the
shareholders of the Company, such amendment will require the consent of the
Company.   Section 7.17 Restructuring of Transactions. It may be preferable
to effectuate a business combination between Parent and the Company by means
of an alternative structure to the Merger and the Scheme. Accordingly, if,
prior to satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VIII hereto,
Parent proposes the adoption of an alternative structure that otherwise
substantially preserves for Parent, the Company and the holders of the
Company Common Stock   53   the economic and Tax benefits of the
transactions contemplated thereby then the parties shall use their respective
best efforts to effect a business combination among themselves by means of a
mutually agreed upon structure other than the Merger that so preserves such
benefits, including without limitation, a structure that does not require
consummation of the Scheme. In particular, in the event that Parent
determines that approval of the Scheme is uncertain and it waives the
condition set forth in Section 8.2(h), Parent and the Company agree to adopt
an alternative business combination transaction that does not
require consummation of the Scheme. In the event that the parties adopt a
restructured transaction, the Agreement shall be revised to reflect such
transaction as determined necessary by the parties hereto and prior to
closing any such restructured transaction, all material third party and
Governmental Authority declarations, filings, registrations, notices,
authorizations, consents or approvals necessary for the effectuation of such
alternative business combination shall have been obtained and all other
conditions to the parties\' obligations to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby, as applied to such alternative business
combination, shall have been satisfied or waived.   Section 7.18
Integration Team. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent and
Company shall, subject to limitations imposed by applicable law, create an
integration steering team with representatives appointed by the CEOs of
Parent and the Company, and chaired by Parent. The integration steering team
shall be responsible for facilitating the integration of the two companies as
subsidiaries of Newco.   Section 7.19 Newco Ordinary Shares. Newco agrees
that the Newco Ordinary Shares delivered by it on the Closing Date shall be
validly issued and fully paid.   Section 7.20 ADR Depositary Agreement.
Newco, Merger Sub and the ADR Depositary shall enter into the ADR Depositary
Agreement in a form satisfactory to Newco, Parent and the Company.   
ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS   Section 8.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s
Obligation to Effect the Merger. The respective obligations of each party to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to
the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions,
except, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that such conditions may
be waived by the parties in writing pursuant to Section 9.5:   (a)
Shareholders\' Approvals. The Parent Shareholders\' Merger Approval and the
Company Shareholders\' Approval shall have been obtained.   (b) No
Injunction. No court of competent jurisdiction or other competent
Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or

otherwise restricting, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Scheme,
the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.   (c)

become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, and
no stop order suspending such effectiveness shall have been issued and remain

Shares issued pursuant to the Scheme and such agreement shall not have been
withdrawn, and the Newco ADSs issuable in the Merger pursuant to Article II
shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE upon official notice of
issuance.   (e) Statutory Approvals. (i) Either (x) the sale by the Company

Nuclear Sale in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4 hereof with
respect to which all required approvals, authorizations and consents from
Governmental Authorities, including, without limitation, any necessary order
of the NRC consenting to the transfer of the operating licenses for the
Company\'s Nuclear Facilities and any necessary conforming license
amendments, have been received.   (ii) Each of (x) the Company Required
Statutory Approvals, including, with respect to the approval of the New York
Public Service Commission, confirmation that PowerChoice will remain in
effect in accordance with its terms in all material respects following
consummation of the Merger, (y) the Parent Required Statutory Approvals, and
(z) any declaration, filing, registration with, or notice to or
authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Authority required in
connection with (A) the Nuclear Sale, as well as a determination by the New
York Public Service Commission of the level of recovery of stranded costs
resulting from the Nuclear Sale or (B) any alternative arrangement to the
Nuclear Sale agreed to in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.4
hereof (collectively, the "Nuclear Approvals"), shall have been obtained at
or prior to the Merger Effective Time, such approvals shall have become Final
Orders (as defined below), and such Final Orders shall not, individually or

Company Required Statutory Approvals and the Nuclear Approvals, could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect taking into
account the allowed recovery of any stranded costs from the Nuclear Sale, (y)
with respect to the Parent Required Statutory Approvals, could reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (z) with respect to
the Company Required Statutory Approvals, the Parent Required Statutory
Approvals and the Nuclear Approvals, could reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the parties to complete the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. A "Final Order" means action by the
relevant regulatory authority which has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined,
set aside, annulled or suspended, with respect to which any waiting period
prescribed by law before the   55   transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated has expired, and as to which all conditions to the
consummation of such transactions prescribed by law, regulation or order have
been satisfied.   (f) HSR Act. The waiting period (and any extension

Effect" shall be disregarded.   (c) Closing Certificates. Parent and Newco
shall have received a certificate signed by the chief financial officer of

within 20 business days after receipt by Parent and Newco of notice in
writing from the Company, specifying the nature of such breach and requesting
that it be remedied, or the Company shall not have received adequate
assurance of a cure of such breach within such 20 business-day period, (ii)
the Board of Directors of Parent shall withdraw or modify in any manner

9.1(d)(ii) as a result of an action by the Board of Directors of the Parent
prior to obtaining the Parent Merger Shareholders\' Approval or (ii) by
Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) as a result of an action by the Board
of Directors of the Company prior to obtaining the Company Shareholders\'

such termination, then the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee (the
"Termination Fee") equal to $150,000,000 in cash plus the Out-of-Pocket

conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(e)(i) and (ii) with respect to
the Nuclear Sale and Nuclear Approvals only, then the Company shall pay
the Termination Fee plus the Out-of-Pocket Expenses of Parent if a
definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal is  
60   executed within one year of such termination; provided further that
there is no arrangement or understanding between the Company and the party
making the Acquisition Proposal at the time of such termination.   (c) The
parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty. The parties further agree
that if any party is or becomes obligated to pay a termination fee pursuant
to Sections 9.3(a) and (b), the right to receive such termination fee shall
be the sole remedy of the other party with respect to the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such payment obligation. If this Agreement is
terminated by a party as a result of a willful breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement by the other party, the non-breaching party
may pursue any remedies available to it at law or in equity and shall be
entitled to recover any amounts thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 9.3, if one party fails to promptly pay to
the other any fee or expense due under this Section 9.3, in addition to any
amounts paid or payable pursuant to such Section, the defaulting party shall
pay the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action,

fee at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such
