(d) During the 60-day period following the Sellers receipt of the items set
forth in _clause (c)_ above, the Seller and its representatives shall,
during normal business hours, have the right to review and inspect the books,
records and other documents (including work papers, accounts, reports,

Purchasers preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, calculation of the Final

Balance Sheet, Final Working Capital Adjustment, Final Closing Date Revenue
Run-Rate and/or Final Closing Purchase Price Reduction (the " _Adjustment
Report_ "). If the Seller fails to respond to the Purchaser within such 60-day
period, the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Final Working Capital Adjustment, the Final Closing Date
Revenue Run-Rate and the Final Closing Purchase Price Reduction as delivered
by the Purchaser. Following the delivery of any Adjustment Report, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in good faith to attempt to resolve
any objections to the Closing Balance Sheet, Final Working Capital Adjustment,
Final Closing Date Revenue Run-Rate and/or Final Closing Purchase Price
Reduction, including by providing the other party and its representatives with
the right to review and reasonably inspect the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, accounts, reports, schedules, financial
statements and memoranda) pertaining to or used in connection with the
Sellers or the Purchasers, as applicable, preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheet, calculation of the Final Working Capital Adjustment,
calculation of the Final Closing Date Revenue Run-Rate and calculation of the
Final Closing Purchase Price Reduction, in each case as reasonably requested
by such party.

(e) If the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve any objections to
the Closing Balance Sheet, Final Working Capital Adjustment, Final Closing
Date Revenue Run-Rate and Final Closing Purchase Price Reduction set forth in
the Adjustment Report within 15 days after the Purchaser has received such
Adjustment Report, the dispute shall be referred to the Independent
Accountants for resolution. The Independent Accountants shall act as an
arbitrator and shall make a determination as to each of the items in dispute
as set forth in the Adjustment Report, which determination shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon each of the parties hereto. The Purchaser and the
Seller shall instruct the Independent Accountants that the determination of
such matters shall be rendered within 30 days after referral to
such Independent Accountants or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable.
In resolving a disputed item, the Independent Accountants may not assign a
value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party, in each case as presented to the Independent Accountants. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each other and with each others
authorized representatives in order to resolve any and all matters in dispute
under this _Section 2.07(e)_ as soon as practicable. The fees and costs of
the Independent Accountants, if one is required, shall be borne by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accountants, which
proportionate allocation will also be determined by the Independent
Accountants.

 

(f) The parties hereto agree to prepare and deliver all calculations, balance
sheets, acknowledgements, reports and adjustments required or permitted under
this _Section 2.07_ in good faith.

shall apply (notwithstanding the absence of any express cross-reference) with
the same force and effect to each other Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule
to which it is reasonably apparent that such disclosures should apply; and (b)
the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Seller
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event, or circumstance
or that, absent such inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or
would be reasonably likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To
the extent this _Article III_ refers to information or documents to be
delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser, the Seller shall be deemed to have
satisfied its obligation if it or any of its representatives has made

Organizational Documents of Scout and Scout Distributors, each as in effect
on the date hereof.

authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and the Ancillary

it is or will be a party, and the performance by it of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, in each instance, as applicable, have been duly
authorized by all requisite action on the part of the Seller. This Agreement
constitutes, and each other Ancillary Agreement to which the Seller is or will
be a party will constitute when executed and delivered, as applicable, a

Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and
similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally.

Section 3.03 _No Conflict_. Assuming that all Consents, actions, filings and
notifications described in  _Schedule 3.04_ of the Disclosure Schedule have
been obtained or made, the execution, delivery and performance by the Seller

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to: (i) materially and adversely
affect the ability of the Seller to carry out its obligations under, and to
consummate the Transaction; or (ii) otherwise be material to the Seller.

 

Section 3.04 _Consents and Approvals_. The execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement by the Seller do not and will
not require any Consent of, action by, filing with, or notification to, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person, except: (a) for the Client

Section 3.15 _Insurance_. The Seller has delivered to the Purchaser true and
complete copies of each insurance policy and bond covering the Scout Group or

ordinary course), all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid and
neither Scout Group Member is in material breach or in default under any such
insurance policies. The Scout Group has not received written notice from any
insurer or agent of any intent to cancel any such

 



\- 36 -  insurance policy or bond, or materially increase premiums with respect to
any such insurance policy or bond. There is no Claim pending under any of such

the Leases, each, a " _Leased Property_ " and collectively the " _Leased
Properties_ "). Such Scout Group Member has a good and valid leasehold
interest in each Leased Property subject only to the terms and conditions of

_Schedule 3.16(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, no Scout Group Member has
granted to any Person, whether by sublease or otherwise, the right to use or
occupy any Leased Property or any portion thereof. All Leases are in full
force and effect and are binding and enforceable against the applicable Scout
Group Member and, to the Knowledge of the Seller, against the respective third
party lessors, sublessors, licensors, and other parties to such Leases
(collectively, " _Lessors_ "), except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar legal requirements
affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and general principles
of equity, regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law.
Correct and complete copies of all such Leases, as restated, supplemented,
amended or modified through the date hereof, have been made available to
Purchaser. The Scout Group does not own, and has not owned during the past
five years, any real property.

 

(c) With respect to the Leases: (i) no Scout Group Member: (A) is in default

other default by either Scout Group Member in any material respect under any
of the other terms of the Leases; (ii) to the Knowledge of the Seller, no

circumstance exists which, if not remedied, and whether with or without
notice or the passage of time or both, would result in such a default by
either Scout Group Member, or permit the termination or modification of, or
acceleration of rent under, any Lease. To the Knowledge of the Seller, the
present use of the Leased Properties is in substantial conformity with all
applicable legal requirements, and neither Scout Group Member nor the Seller
has received any written notice of any violation or alleged violation thereof.

 



\- 37 - (d) No security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect any Lease
has been applied in respect of a breach or default under such Lease which has

and occupancy agreements for real property in which the Scout Group Members
were a party or had any right or interest (collectively, the " _Terminated
Leases_ ") have expired or been terminated; (ii) all rents and other sums due
and payable by either Scout Group Member in connection with the Terminated
Leases have been paid in full; and (iii) all obligations imposed on Scout or
the Seller in connection with any Terminated Leases have been fully satisfied
and neither any Scout Group Member nor the Seller have any remaining Liability
in connection with the Terminated Leases.

 

(f) The Scout Group is in occupancy of all of the Leased Properties and no
Person other than the Scout Group has the right to use or occupy any portion
of the Leased Property other than Scout. The Leases constitute all of the real
property used, occupied or operated by the Scout Group.

contracts or agreements providing compensation or benefits, whether formal or
informal, oral or written, or subject to ERISA, to which the either Scout
Group Member or any ERISA Affiliate thereof is a party, with respect to which
either Scout Group Member or any ERISA Affiliate thereof has any obligation or

Member or any ERISA Affiliate thereof with or for the benefit of any current
or former manager, director, officer, employee, consultant, or independent
contractor of either Scout Group Member, or under which either Scout Group
Member, has or may have any Liability (collectively, the " _Plans_ "). With
respect to each Plan, the Seller has delivered to the Purchaser a true and

\- 38 -  governing documents in all material respects, and the Closing will not
result in any default thereunder, including after the giving of notice, lapse
of time, or both. No Claim is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller,
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) or any fiduciaries thereof with respect to any Plan. All
material contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been made on or before their due dates. All contributions,
premiums or payments required to be made by either Scout Group Member under or
with respect to any Plan for any period ending on or before the Closing Date
that are not yet due or required to be made have been properly accrued on the
Interim Financial Statements, and there are no unfunded liabilities
thereunder. Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a material
Liability to either Scout Group Member, with respect to each Plan, all
reports, returns, notices and other documentation that are required to have
been filed with or furnished to the IRS, the United States Department of Labor
or any other Governmental Authority, or to the participants or beneficiaries
of such Plan, have been filed or furnished on a timely basis. Each Plan that
is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of the Code may rely on an IRS
opinion letter or is covered by a current favorable determination letter
issued by the IRS to such effect and to the Knowledge of the Seller nothing
has occurred since the date of such determination or opinion letter that could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of the qualified status of
any such Plan.

(c) _Absence of Certain Types of Plans_. No Plan is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 302 of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code. Neither
Scout Group Member nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has at any time during the
last six (6) years contributed to, been obligated to contribute to, sponsored,

or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "); or (ii) other "employee
pension plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) with respect to
which either Scout Group Member has or could incur Liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Plan provides for post-
termination or retiree life, health, medical, or other welfare benefits to
any current or former employees, directors or other service providers or the
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for group health plan continuation
coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA. No Plan is maintained or subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States.

(d) _Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events_. Except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to either Scout Group
Member, there has been no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan.

(e) _Acceleration and Vesting_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(e)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule or otherwise expressly contemplated hereunder,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transaction will cause or result in (either alone or in combination with
another event): (i) Liability of either Scout Group Member to or with respect
to any or its current or former employees, directors or other service
providers for any payments; or (ii) the acceleration of the timing of payment
or vesting in or triggering of any material payment or funding of

bargaining agreement or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by either Scout Group Member, and, to the Knowledge of the Seller,

collective bargaining. The Scout Group Members have complied with the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) and any applicable or similar state or local

employees or independent contractors, equal opportunity, occupational safety
and health, collective bargaining, nondiscrimination, harassment,

pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened charges of unfair labor
practices, employment discrimination or other wrongful action with respect to
any aspect of employment of any person employed or formerly employed by the

good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, operation, or leasing

Material Adverse Effect.

authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which

any other Person, except as described in _Schedule 4.04_ of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.07 _Client Consents_. 

(a) _Target Funds_.

 

(i) The Seller and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain in accordance with the Investment Company Act, as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof, the approval by the board of trustees
of each Target Fund (its " _Target Fund Board Approval_ ") of the Target Funds
Plan of Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby. To the
extent Target Fund Board Approval has been obtained in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, the Seller and its Affiliates shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Target Fund to obtain
in accordance with the Investment Company Act, as promptly as practicable
following the date of the applicable Target Fund Board Approval, the approval
by the shareholders of such Target Fund of the Target Funds Plan of
Reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby (its " _Target Fund
Shareholder Approval_ "). The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall cooperate
with the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective advisers and shall
furnish to the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective advisers such
information and assistance as the Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
advisers may reasonably request in connection with seeking Target Fund Board

\- 57 - (ii) The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain in accordance with the Investment Company Act, as promptly as

").

(iii) The Seller covenants and agrees that none of the information regarding
the Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller or any Target Fund supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of the Seller in writing for inclusion in
prospectuses, registration statements and proxy statements, including
the registration statement on Form N-14 (the " _N-14 Registration Statement_
") to be filed by the Purchaser with the SEC relating to the shares of the
Purchaser Funds issuable thereunder and the proxy statement that will form a
part of such prospectus (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), as amended or
supplemented by any amendment or supplement filed by the Purchaser with the
SEC, will, at the respective times such documents are filed with the SEC and
distributed to the shareholders of the applicable Target Funds, or at the
time of the meeting of shareholders of the applicable Target Funds, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(iv) The Purchaser shall file the N-14 Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in accordance with applicable Laws. The Purchaser
covenants and agrees that none of the information regarding the Purchaser or
any of Affiliate of the Purchaser supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf
of the Purchaser in writing for inclusion in the N-14 Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as amended or supplemented by any amendment
or supplement filed by the Purchaser with the SEC, will, at the respective
times such documents are filed with the SEC and distributed to the
shareholders of the Target Funds, or at the time of the meeting of
shareholders of the Target Funds, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(v) The parties hereto agree that the Target Funds designated as "Key Target
Funds" on _Exhibit A_ (the " _Key Target Funds_ ") shall be deemed to be
Consenting Clients for all purposes under this Agreement if, and only if, each
of the Target Fund Board Approval, the Target Fund Shareholder Approval and
the Purchaser Fund Board Approval has been obtained for each Key Target Fund
(and has not been withdrawn, lapsed, or otherwise terminated) and all
conditions precedent to the transactions contemplated by the Target Funds
Plan of Reorganization for each Key Target Fund have been satisfied or waived
and such transactions are ready to be consummated simultaneously with the
Closing; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any
Key Target Fund has not satisfied each of the foregoing conditions set forth
in this _clause (v)_ , then, no Key Target Fund shall be deemed to be a
Consenting Client.

 



\- 58 - (vi) The Seller and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the approval
by the board of trustees of each fund listed on _Exhibit B-1_ and otherwise to
effect the transactions and other matters contemplated on _Exhibit B-1_ prior
to the Closing and following the Closing, as applicable.

(b) _Subadvised Funds_. Within 15 days after the date of this Agreement,
the Seller shall, and shall cause Scout to, after consultation with and with
the assistance of the Purchaser: (i) contact each investment adviser for each
Subadvised Fund to discuss the structure of, and rationale for, the
Transaction and the Consent process for such Subadvised Fund; (ii) to the
extent required by applicable Law or Contract, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and secure the approvals required under Section 15 of the
Investment Company Act (or any applicable SEC exemptive order) (or, in the
case of the Canadian Subadvised Fund, the Ireland Subadvised Fund and the
Luxembourg Subadvised Fund, the equivalent Law applicable to each such
Subadvised Fund) for a new Advisory Agreement between such investment adviser
(and, if required by such Subadvised Fund or such investment adviser, such
Subadvised Fund) and Scout in form and substance substantially similar to the
existing Advisory Agreement between Scout and such Subadvised Fund or
such investment adviser to such Subadvised Fund to be effective as of the
Closing; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Purchaser, such investment adviser and such Subadvised Fund to obtain from the
Purchaser and provide to such investment adviser and the board of directors /
trustees of such Subadvised Fund any data or information that such investment
adviser or such board may reasonably request in connection with making,
giving, or obtaining the required Subadvised Fund Consents. If, with respect
to any Subadvised Fund, any modifications are required to the Consent process
for such Subadvised Fund as outlined in this _Section 5.07(b)_ or any form of
Consent, the Seller shall, and shall cause Scout to, promptly notify the
Purchaser regarding the modifications (if the Purchasers representatives do
not join Scout in their discussions with the investment adviser or the board
of directors / trustees of such Subadvised Fund), and the Purchaser and Scout
shall work with such investment adviser or such board of directors / trustees
in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable plan for making, giving, or
obtaining any such Consents.

 

(c) _Notices to Other Clients_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
the Seller shall cause Scout to send a Consent notice, in each case in a form
mutually acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller, to:

(i) those Clients (except Managed Account Sponsors of Managed Account
Programs) whose Advisory Agreements require written Consent to be assigned;

(ii) those Clients (except Managed Account Sponsors of Managed Account
Programs) whose Advisory Agreements require Consent, but not written Consent,
to be assigned (" _Implied Consent Clients_ ");

 

(iii) those Clients which are Managed Account Sponsors of Managed Account
Programs (which, among other things, shall request: (A) each Managed

 



\- 59 -  Account Sponsors Consent; and (B) that such Managed Account Sponsor notify
and, to the extent necessary under applicable Law or required by such Managed
Account Sponsor, obtain the Consent of, the Clients whose accounts are
advised or sub-advised by Scout through the such Managed Account Sponsors
Managed Account Program);

 

(iv) the designated management company for the Collective Fund; and

 

(v) the members of each Private Fund.

 

Each Consent notice delivered under this _Section 5.07(c)_ shall: (I) inform
the applicable Client of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which would result in "assignment" (as defined under the Advisers Act and/or
under such Clients Advisory Agreement, as applicable) of such Clients
Advisory Agreement: and (II) without limiting the immediately succeeding
paragraph, request the written consent or approval of such "assignment" (or
any additional or alternative consent or approval as required by the Advisory
Agreement or applicable Law).

 

The parties hereto agree that: (A) notwithstanding any contrary provision
contained in this Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and any applicable Advisory Agreement, the Consent of any applicable
Client may be obtained through the use of a negative Consent pursuant to the
terms of this _Section 5.07_ and such Client shall be a Consenting Client for
purposes of this Agreement: (x) upon receipt of a written consent requested
in the Consent notice to such Client; or (y) if no such written consent is
received, if 60 days shall have passed since the sending of such Consent
notice to such Client, which such Consent notice shall have informed such
Client: (1) of the intention to complete the Transaction, which will result in
an "assignment" (as defined in the Advisers Act) of such Clients Advisory
Agreement; (2) of the intention of Scout to continue to provide advisory
services pursuant to such Advisory Agreement after the Closing if such Client
does not terminate such Advisory Agreement prior to the Closing; and (3) that
the consent of such Client will be deemed to have been granted if such Client
fails to terminate such Advisory Agreement within 60 days of Scouts sending
of such Consent notice to such Client. From time to time after the 60th day
following the delivery of the Client notice to a Client, the Seller shall
assess, and shall consider requests from the Purchaser to assess, whether it
would be advisable to send additional notices to such Client (or include
additional notices in connection with other communications to such Client)
regarding the negative consent such Client has deemed to have granted (it
being acknowledged and agreed, however, that the Seller shall be under no
requirement to send any such additional notices).

With respect to each Private Fund, such Private Fund shall be a
Consenting Client for purposes of this Agreement if the consents and
approvals required by the Contracts governing such Private Fund arising in
connection with the Transaction (including the "assignment" of the Advisory
Agreement with respect to such Private Fund) are duly obtained and remain in
effect.

(d) In connection with obtaining Client Consents under this  _Section 5.07_,
the Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) drafts of the forms of all
consent materials prepared by the Seller or any of its Affiliates to the
Purchaser a reasonable time prior to the mailing or distribution of such
documents to any Client in order to afford Purchaser a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such documents. Such forms of all such consent
materials shall be subject to the approval of the Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, 

 



\- 60 -  conditioned, or delayed). The Purchaser shall have the right to review in
advance and to approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) all the information relating to it or its Affiliates
proposed to appear in: (i) any proxy statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto submitted to the SEC or such other applicable Governmental Authority
in connection with the approvals contemplated by this  _Section 5.07_; or
(ii) any other materials sent or made available to the shareholders or other
investors of any Fund in connection with such approvals.

 

(e) In connection with obtaining Client Consents under this _Section 5.07_,
each party shall keep the other reasonably informed of the status thereof and
the Seller shall promptly advise the Purchaser as promptly as practicable if
any Client notifies the Seller or any of its Affiliates (or, in the case of a
Client which is a Subadvised Fund or the Collective Fund, if the advisor or
manager thereof notifies the Seller or any of its Affiliates) orally or in
writing that such Client (or the relevant Subadvised Fund board) has not so
consented or has terminated, or intends to terminate, its Advisory Agreement,
or intends to materially reduce its investment relationship with Scout.

Section 5.08 _No Other Negotiations_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article IX_ ), the Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
their respective Related Persons not to, and shall instruct its advisors and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage, initiate,
continue, or participate or engage in negotiations or discussions with,
provide any confidential information or documentation or access to, or
approve, recommend, execute, or enter into any letter of intent, purchase
agreement, or other similar Contract or understanding with, any Person
relating to the possible sale, lease, or other transfer (in whole or part) of
any interest in the Business or the Scout Stock, or any merger, sale,
consolidation, business combination, or any similar transaction involving the
Business or the Scout Group by any Person other than the Purchaser and/or one
of its Affiliates (a " _Third Party Transaction_ "). The Seller shall
promptly notify the Purchaser if any inquiries or proposals are received by,
any such information is requested from, or any such negotiations or
discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, any such Person or
any of its representatives with respect to a Third Party Transaction. The
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective Related
Persons to, and shall instruct its advisors and representatives to,
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons other than
the Purchaser and its Affiliates that may be ongoing with respect to any such
Third Party Transaction.

 

Section 5.09 _Updates; Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date (or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ ), the Seller
shall promptly disclose to the Purchaser in writing (in the form of an updated
or supplemented Disclosure Schedule): (i) any variances from the
representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ and any other fact,
event, or development that could cause or constitute a breach of the
representations, warranties, or covenants in this Agreement made by the Seller
or that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions to closing for
the Purchaser not to be satisfied in a timely manner; (ii) any Claim pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened, or any written notice received
from a Governmental Authority or any third party, which challenges or seeks
to 

 



\- 61 -  restrain the Transaction; or (iii) the occurrence of any event, change,
circumstance, fact, or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Such
disclosures shall be deemed to amend and supplement the Disclosure Schedule;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in each instance: (A) if any amendment or
supplement to the Disclosure Schedule would entitle the Purchaser to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, then, the Purchaser
shall have the right to provide the Seller with a termination notice within 30
days following the date upon which the Seller delivered to the Purchaser such
amended or supplemented Disclosure Schedule; and (B) whether or not any such
amended or supplemented Disclosure Schedule entitles the Purchaser to
terminate this Agreement, no such amended or supplemented Disclosure
Schedule shall limit, reduce, or otherwise affect the Purchasers right to
seek indemnification for any Damages arising or resulting from such
disclosures (which Purchaser shall have the right to seek as if such
disclosures had not been made and such Disclosure Schedules had not been so
amended or supplemented).

(b) Following the disclosure by the Seller to the Purchaser of any of
the matters set forth in _Section 5.09(a)_, the Seller shall, and shall
cause the Scout Group to, upon the Purchasers reasonable request: (i)
promptly discuss such matters with the Purchaser; (ii) provide the Purchaser
with access to the information and other items contemplated by _Section
5.02_ in connection with its evaluation of such matters; and (iii) regularly
update the Purchaser on the status of such matters and, to the extent
applicable, the Sellers and the Scout Groups activities taken or proposed
to be taken to resolve, remedy, or cure such matters as promptly as
practicable.

 

Section 5.10 _Continuing Employees_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.10(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any such benefits or policies, plans, arrangements, programs,
practices, or agreements that constitute Plans maintained by the Scout Group,
which will continue following the Closing: (A) no Continuing Employee shall
accrue benefits under, or otherwise participate in, any employee benefit
policies, plans, arrangements, programs, practices, or agreements of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Plans) after the Closing; and
(B) the Purchaser shall be responsible for providing all employee benefits
to Continuing Employees for and with respect to all periods during which they
are actually employed after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Seller and the Seller Plans shall be solely
responsible (and neither Purchaser, Scout nor any of its or their Affiliates
shall have any responsibility) for any claims for benefits that were incurred
(or attributable to events occurring) before the Closing, whether or not such
claims are filed after the Closing.

 

(b) For a period of one year following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause
the applicable Scout Group Member to (and, as applicable, the Purchaser
shall): (i) provide each Continuing Employee with: (A) salary, bonus
opportunities, and severance benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing, it being acknowledged and agreed that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the bonus opportunities of the Scout Groups portfolio managers may
vary based on the performance of their respective strategies during such one
year period; and (B) substantially the same retirement and welfare benefits
(not described in (A) above) that the Purchaser offers to its own

 



\- 62 -  employees who are similarly situated to such Continuing Employee, as set
forth on _Section 5.10(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule; and (ii) recognize for
all purposes under all applicable benefit plans and compensation plans and
programs all service of the Continuing Employees with the Scout Group Members,
as applicable, as if such service were with the Purchaser. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and: (A) unless a Continuing Employee is employed pursuant to an
employment agreement for a fixed term; (B) subject to applicable Law; and (C)
subject to _Section 5.10(d)_ below: (x) all Continuing Employees may be
employed on an at-will basis; and (y) the Purchaser and the Scout Group shall
be able to terminate a Continuing Employee at any time for any reason or no
reason.

 

(c) The Purchaser shall (and, as applicable, shall cause the Scout Group to)
offer employment to any Person who has the right (or would have the right)
pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Leave Acts (and any similar federal,
state, or local Law) to return to the employment of Scout and/or Scout
Distributors, following the Closing, consistent with the requirements of the
Federal Leave Acts and any other applicable Law.

(d) The Purchaser shall (and, as applicable, shall cause the Scout Group to)
retain its Continuing Employees for such period as may be necessary, when
considered together with any employees discharged by Scout and/or Scout
Distributors, prior to the Closing, to avoid, with respect to any facility
operated by Scout, Scout Distributors, or the Business: a "plant closing,"
"mass layoff," "layoff," "relocation" or "termination" of "employees" (as
those terms are defined in WARN); or any Liability to the Seller under
any applicable Law which could arise from any actual or anticipated
termination of employees by the Purchaser or the Scout Group after the
Closing.

 

(e) The Purchaser shall have sole Liability for any severance payments and/or
similar obligations that are or may become owed or payable to any employee of
Scout and/or Scout Distributors who the Purchaser does not offer employment
(or continued employment) with the Purchaser, any of its Affiliates and/or the
Scout Group as of, and after, the Closing Date in accordance with this 
_Section 5.10_ (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any employee of either
Scout Group Member who is an employee of such Scout Group Member as of the
date of this Agreement and who is terminated prior to the Closing Date with
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and neither the Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have any Liability for any such payments or
similar obligations. The Seller shall have sole Liability for any severance
payments and/or similar obligations that are or may become owed or payable to
any employee of either Scout Group Member who is hired by such Scout Group
Member following the date hereof and prior to the Closing without the written
consent of the Purchaser and whose employment is lawfully terminated by the
Purchaser or such Scout Group Member prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date.

 

(f) Without limiting _Section 5.10(e)_ above, from and after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Scout Group to perform all payment and
other obligations of each Scout Group Member under all Contracts with the
Continuing Employees that do not terminate upon the Closing, including
employment, severance payment and other similar Contracts, including the
Contracts listed on _Schedule 5.10(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, and, for
the avoidance of doubt, except as expressly provided herein, neither the
Seller nor any of its

 



\- 63 -  Affiliates shall have any Liability for any such payments or other
obligations. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have in
effect a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code that will accept
the direct rollover of "eligible rollover" distributions (as that term is
defined under Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) (including loan promissory
notes) from the Sellers 401(k) Plan with respect to account balances of
Continuing Employees. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Seller shall pay or cause each Scout
Group Member to pay any and all compensation (including salary, bonuses and
employee benefits) earned by Continuing Employees for any period ending on or
prior to the Closing and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any liability or responsibility for making any such payments, it being
acknowledged and agreed that certain of such payments will be made following
the Closing (including in accordance with _clause (g)_ below, the Benefits
Side Letter and the Employees Side Letter).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) prior to
the Closing, Seller shall terminate or cause Scout to terminate the Scout
LTIP and, at or as soon as practicable (but not more than five Business Days)
after the Closing, Seller shall pay any and all participant account balances
and/or other amounts payable to participants under said plan (whether or not
previously vested) in full and final satisfaction of such participants rights
and interest under and with respect to such plan, (ii) Seller shall have the
sole obligation to maintain the account balances of, and make payments to,
any Continuing Employees participating in the UMB Financial Corporation
Deferred Compensation Plan, which payments shall be made in accordance with
the terms of said plan, and (iii) Seller shall have sole responsibility for
paying employees/participants of any Scout Group Member in any other
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan any amounts due or owing or to become
due and owing to such employee/participants under any such other plans.
Following the Closing, Scout will provide Seller with employee termination
information and such other information as the Seller may reasonably request to
enable the Seller to satisfy its payment obligations to Continuing Employees
under any Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, including, without
limitation, the UMB Financial Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any contrary provision contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall confer any rights or remedies
upon any employee or former employee of Scout, Scout Distributors, any
Continuing Employee, or upon any other Person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, and no provision of this _Section
5.10_ is intended to amend, or to be an amendment to, any of the Plans.

 

(i) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing (or until the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ ), the Seller
shall, and shall cause the Scout Group and each of its other Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to lawfully enforce and prosecute all
material terms of each employment agreement or similar agreement with
employees of Scout or Scout Distributors, including any Key Employee
Agreements then in effect, including all material terms relating to post-
employment restrictive covenants.

 

(j) To the extent any of the Retention Arrangements would expire solely as a
result of the passage of time between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
the Seller shall waive any such expiration until the earlier of the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 



\- 64 - (k) The Seller acknowledges and agrees that, effective as of the Closing, the
Seller intends for each of the Purchaser and each Scout Group Member to be a
third party beneficiary to each of the Contracts set forth on _Schedule
3.17(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, with all of the Sellers rights and
benefits thereunder and rights of enforcement attendant thereto.

Closing Date or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to the
Closing Date (such services as so provided to such Restricted Person, the "
_Restricted Services_ ");

 

(iii) provide Restricted Services to a Restricted Person;

 

(iv) solicit or induce any Person (other than the Seller and its Affiliates)
with the effect or for the purpose of: (A) causing any funds or assets with
respect to which Scout provides Investment Advisory Services to be withdrawn
from Scouts provision thereof (other than any such funds or assets of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates); (B) causing any Person (other than the
Seller and its Affiliates) not to engage Scout or any of its Affiliates to
provide Investment Advisory Services for any funds or assets or additional
funds or assets; or (C) causing any Person (other than the Seller and its
Affiliates) to terminate or diminish its relationship involving Investment
Advisory Services with Scout or any of its Affiliates; or

 

(v) solicit or hire, or attempt to solicit or hire, any Continuing Employee
for employment or in any other capacity (including, without limitation, as an
independent contractor or consultant); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _clause (v)_ shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from: (A)
advertising, publishing, or posting open positions in the course of normal
hiring practices or otherwise engaging in any other ordinary course hiring
practices, such as employee searches by third party search firms, in each
case, that are not specifically sent to, or do not specifically target, any
Continuing Employees, so long as, subject to _clause (B)_ below, no such
Continuing Employee is hired by the Seller or any such Affiliates; or (B)
soliciting for employment or hiring any 

 



\- 65 -  Continuing Employee who: (x) was terminated by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates; or (y) has not been employed by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates for a period of at least six months.

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.11(a)_ hereof, in order to induce the Seller

foregoing _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ shall, to the extent such
services or activities would constitute any part of a Competing Business: (x)
be offered or provided to Restricted Persons (except to the extent expressly
set forth in  _clause (B)_ and only to the extent provided in a manner
consistent with the way in which such services or activities are provided as

business or Person (and any other business or Person acquired in connection
with such transaction) for such fiscal year, and thereafter (in each case)
operating the Competing Business that is so acquired; _provided_ , _however_ ,

covenants, the Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement; and (ii)
the character, duration and geographical scope of the covenants in this
_Section 5.11_ are reasonable in light of the circumstances as they exist on

invalid or unenforceable term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable provision, in order
to render the restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section 5.11_
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; and (C) the
restrictive covenants set forth in this _Section 5.11_ shall be enforceable

hereto shall provide one another with such cooperation and information as any
of them reasonably may request of the other(s) (and the Purchaser shall cause
the Scout Group to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any

for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, or participating in or conducting
any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by taxing authorities. The parties hereto shall make
themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or
information provided under this _Section 6.02_. Each of the parties hereto
shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other

to Tax matters of the Scout Group for any taxable period that includes the
Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of: (a) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions; or (b)

notice, to remove and retain all or any part of such documents as such other

delayed. Except as otherwise required by Law, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit a Scout Group Member or any of its Affiliates to, amend any
Tax Return of the Scout Group Member with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not to be

except to the extent taken into account in Working Capital, as finally
determined, and the Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller any such refund or
the amount of any such credit, net of any Taxes imposed on receipt of such

measured by income or receipts of the Scout Group that is allocable to the
portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Tax period of any partnership or other
pass-through entity in which the Scout Group holds a beneficial interest
shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and the amount of any other Tax of
the Scout Group that is allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
the entire Straddle Period.

(b) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser
shall (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the taxable year
of the Scout Group on the Closing Date and (ii) to the extent any such taxable

Returns for the period including the Closing Date on the basis that the
relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

of the Scout Stock under this Agreement. The Seller shall pay any Tax
attributable to the making of the Tax Election. The Tax Election shall be made

consideration to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and other items properly
includible in the deemed sales price of the Assets of the Scout Group pursuant
to the Tax Election shall be allocated, for Tax purposes, among the Assets of
the Scout Group in a manner consistent with the provisions of Section 338 and
Section 1060 of the Code and all Regulations promulgated thereunder and
_Schedule 6.07_ of the Disclosure Schedule hereto. Each of the parties hereto
shall report the Transaction in a manner consistent with  _Schedule 6.07_ of
the Disclosure Schedule for all Tax purposes and none of them shall take any
position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent therewith unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate in
good faith to agree within 120 days of the Closing Date on the applicable
allocation of the consideration paid pursuant to this Agreement.

hereto, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute between them; _provided_ that if the parties hereto are unable
to resolve such dispute, the parties hereto shall submit the dispute to the
Independent Accountants for resolution, which resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The fees and expenses relating
to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed by either of the parties hereto
shall be shared equally by the Purchaser and the Seller.

Section 6.10  _Consolidated Return Elections_. Seller shall make or refrain
from making (or cause its Affiliates to make or refrain from making), as
applicable, any Tax elections (including on a protective basis) so that the

than De Minimis Damages) specifying the factual basis of the Claim in
reasonable detail, as well as the amount claimed (if any), within the
applicable survival period as defined in this  _Section 8.01_. The failure
to give such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its Liability
under this _Article VIII_ if such notice is not delivered by the Indemnified
Party by the end of any applicable survival period set forth in this _Section
8.01_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if written notice of a Claim has been
provided to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms hereof prior

thereto: (i) under any insurance coverage in effect and applicable to such
Damages net of any reasonable and documented expense actually incurred by such

alleged to be responsible therefore, net of any reasonable and documented
expense actually incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.
If an Indemnified Party receives an amount pursuant to the foregoing with
respect to any Damages at any time subsequent to any indemnification provided
such Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , then, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for
any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in connection

\- 83 - Section 8.05 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under _Section
8.02_ or _Section 8.03_ of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim
(other than any Tax Claims), such Indemnified Party shall give notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend such
Third-Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure
to give such notice.

(b) If an Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
_Section 8.05(a)_ of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume, at its own expense, the defense of such
Third-Party Claim to the extent that it wishes; _provided_ , that if the
Indemnified Party, based in each instance on the reasonable advice of outside
counsel, reasonably concludes that there are defenses available to it that are
different or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that
the interests of the Indemnified Party may be reasonably deemed to conflict
with those of the Indemnifying Party, then, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to select a single separate counsel (who shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party) and to participate in the Indemnifying
Partys defense of such Third-Party Claim, with the reasonable and documented
fees and expenses of such counsel to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
as incurred to the extent that they relate to such Third-Party Claim.
After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, then, subject to the
proviso in the first sentence of this _Section 8.05(b)_, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_
for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and, at the Indemnified
Partys own expense, to employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party, it being acknowledged and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of one primary counsel and one local counsel retained by the
Indemnified Party if the Third Party Claim: (i) involves any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation against the
Indemnified Party or any of its respective Affiliates; or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to result in an injunction against the Indemnified
Party or any of its respective Affiliates. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel (one
primary counsel and one local counsel) employed by the Indemnified Party for
any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall
have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided in _Section
8.05(a)_). No compromise or settlement of, or admission of liability with
respect to, such Third-Party Claims may be effected by either the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party without the other partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the assertion of any Third-
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party does not, within 45 days after the
Indemnified 

 



\- 84 -  Partys notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have waived its right to assume such defense and,
subject to the terms and limitations set forth under this _Article VIII_ ,
will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim and any
compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party and shall be
responsible for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel
(one primary counsel and one local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties as set
forth in this paragraph.

 

(c) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this _Article VIII_ : (i) both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party, as the case may be, shall, subject to applicable Law, keep the other
Person(s) reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any
related Claims at all stages thereof where such Person(s) is (are)

enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Transaction shall have become final
and non-appealable;

date as: (i) the Seller and the Purchaser may mutually agree in writing; or

pursuant to _Section 10.10(a)_) (the " _Termination Date_ "), by written
notice to the other party in accordance with _Section 10.01_, if the Closing

party has failed to use all commercially reasonable efforts (or any other
efforts explicitly set forth herein) to satisfy the conditions precedent set
forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_, as applicable, to such partys
obligation to close);

 

(d) by the Seller by written notice to the Purchaser upon the Purchasers
breach of this Agreement and such breach, individually or combined with any
other such breach: (i) would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in _Section 7.01_; and (ii) is not: (x) cured within 30 days
following delivery by the Seller to the Purchaser of written notice of such
breach; or (y) capable of cure by the Termination Date; or

(e) by the Purchaser by written notice to the Seller upon the Sellers breach
of this Agreement and such breach, individually or combined with any other
such breach: (i) would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions contained in

by the Purchaser to the Seller of written notice of such breach; or (y)
capable of cure by the Termination Date.

 

Section 9.02 _Notice of Termination; Effects of Termination_. If a party

notice stating that such party is terminating this Agreement and setting forth
a brief description of the basis on which such party is terminating this
Agreement. Any permitted termination of this Agreement under _Section 9.01_
above will be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the

_Section 9.01(d)_ or _Section 9.01(e)_ above, the breach giving rise to such
termination is: (a) capable of being cured; and (b) not cured during the
applicable cure period set forth therein, whereupon such permitted
termination of this Agreement will be effective immediately following the end
of such applicable cure period. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, all further obligations of the parties hereunder
shall terminate and this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect, except for the obligations set forth in _Article I_

intentional breach of this Agreement or negate a Claim of Fraud against the
Seller, the Purchaser, or Raymond James, as applicable, with respect to the
representations made by the Seller or the Purchaser, as applicable, in this
Agreement, and for the avoidance of doubt, each warranty made by the Seller or
the Purchaser, as applicable, in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
representation made by such Person for purposes of the foregoing.

Section 10.02 _Announcements_. No party hereto shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the Transaction unless the Seller, on the one hand, and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, have mutually agreed as to the form, content and
timing of such press release or announcement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein will prohibit the Seller, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on
the other hand, from issuing or causing publication of any such press release
or public announcement to the extent that such party determines such action
to be required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange applicable to it or
its Affiliates, in which event the party making such determination shall, if
practicable in the circumstances, use reasonable efforts to allow the Seller
(in the case of a press release or public announcement of the Purchaser) or
the Purchaser (in the case of a press release or public announcement of the
Seller) reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of the issuance. Each party hereto shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective Related Persons to comply with this _Section 10.02_.

 

Section 10.03 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any

 



\- 87 -  other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid, void, or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination, to the greatest extent legally permissible, shall
have the power to reduce or alter the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void, or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision.

 

Section 10.04 _Entire Agreement_. Subject to _Section 5.03(a)_, this
Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, which are an integral part of this Agreement), the Ancillary
Agreements and any other Contract between the Seller and the Purchaser entered
into in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
with the Closing shall constitute the entire understanding and agreement of
the parties hereto, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, written and
oral, between the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 10.05 _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; No Assignment_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal or equitable
right, remedy, or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part
hereof, except such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted
assignee pursuant to this _Section 10.05_. No party hereto may assign this
Agreement or any rights hereunder to any other Person without the prior
written consent of the Seller (in the case of the Purchaser) or the Purchaser
(in the case of the Seller); _provided_ , _however_ , that either party hereto
may assign its rights or interests or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement to an Affiliate so long as such party retains its obligations
under this Agreement.

Section 10.06 _Amendment_.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each of the Seller and the Purchaser, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by law.

Section 10.07 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ALL RESPECTS UNDER
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAWS

state or federal court of appropriate jurisdiction located in New York, New
York, Borough of Manhattan, in connection with any Claim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally: (i)
agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that any such
Claim may be heard and determined in such courts; (ii) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Claim in any such court; and (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Claim in any such court.
Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 10.01_.

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT

INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION.
EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,

OF SUCH WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN

Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one and the
same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature
pages by facsimile transmission or by PDF (portable document format) file
shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the
parties hereto and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all
purposes. Signature of the parties hereto transmitted by facsimile or PDF file
shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.

 

Section 10.09 _Business Days_. References to "days" shall refer to calendar
days unless Business Days are specified. If the due date for any payment or
notice required or contemplated by this Agreement is not a Business Day, then,
such payment shall be payable on the first Business Day following the payment
or notice date specified in this Agreement. If any period expires on a day
which is not a Business Day or any event or condition is required by the terms
of this Agreement to occur or be fulfilled on a day which is not a Business
Day, such period shall expire or such event or condition shall occur or
be fulfilled, as the case may be, on the next succeeding Business Day. Any
action required to be taken "within" a specified time period following the

\- 89 - Section 10.10 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that, prior to the Closing (or the earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article IX_), irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the
Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ ), the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof (without any requirement to post any bond or
other security in connection with seeking such relief) in any court of
competent jurisdiction and that this shall include the right of the Seller to
cause the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the right of the Purchaser to cause
the Seller, on the other hand, to fully perform the terms of this Agreement to
the fullest extent permissible pursuant to this Agreement and applicable Law
and to thereafter cause this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions thereto
set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall
not be entitled to any such injunction if: (i) the Seller is then in breach of
this Agreement; and (ii) such breach would result in the failure (in whole or
in part) of any of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.02_ to be
satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to any such injunction if: (A) the Purchaser is then in breach of
this Agreement; and (B) such breach would result in the failure (in whole or
in part) of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ to be
satisfied.

(b) With respect to the specific performance contemplated by _clause (a)
_above:

(i) The parties hereto agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent any such breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent any such breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the parties hereto under this Agreement; and

 

(ii) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such action or proceeding relating to this  _Section 10.10_, for itself and
in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, and, for purposes of this _Section
10.10_, each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in _Section 10.01_.

Section 10.11 _Conflicts and Privilege_. 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, files maintained by Stradley Ronon
Stevens and Young, LLP (" _Counsel_ ") and the attorney-client privilege of the
Scout Group with Counsel relating to the Transaction shall be deemed to be the
right of the Seller, and not that of

 



\- 90 -  the Scout Group, and may be waived only by the Seller, and all other
attorney-client privileges of the Scout Group shall be retained by the Scout
Group. Following the Closing Date, all communications in any form or format
whatsoever between or among Counsel, on the one hand, and the Scout Group and
the Seller Transaction Related Parties (as defined below) through the Closing
Date, or any of their respective directors, trustees, officers, employees, or
other representatives, on the other hand, that relate to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Transaction (collectively, the "
_Privileged Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-client
privileged and that the Privileged Communications and the expectation of
confidence relating thereto belong solely to the Seller, shall be controlled
by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the
Scout Group, or any of their respective Affiliates.

(b) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that, as of immediately
prior to the Closing, the Scout Group is the client of Counsel. After the
Closing, it is possible that Counsel will represent the Seller and/or their
respective Related Persons (individually and collectively, the " _Seller
Transaction Related Parties_ ") in connection with matters and/or Claims
relating to, or arising out of, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that Counsel may represent the Seller
Transaction Related Parties in the future in connection with matters and/or
Claims relating to, or arising out of, this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Scout Group or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party
other than the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, the
Purchaser, the Scout Group, or their respective Affiliates may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged
Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Purchaser, the Scout Group, or their respective Affiliates may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of the Seller. In the event that
the Purchaser, the Scout Group, or any of their respective Affiliates is
legally required by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy
of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, the Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Seller in writing (including by making specific reference
to this _Section 10.11_) so that the Seller can seek a protective order and
the Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist
therewith, it being acknowledged and agreed that nothing contained in this
_clause (c)_ shall be deemed to interfere with the ability of the Purchaser,
the Scout Group, or any of their respective Affiliates to comply with any
legal requirement or applicable law.

 

Section 10.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and
nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and such successors and assigns, any
rights, claims or benefits or to create or establish any third-
party beneficiary hereunder, and no party will incur any Liability or
obligation to any third party because of any reliance by that third party on
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement;
_provided_ that: (a) each Covered Person shall be a third-party beneficiary
of the terms set forth in _Section 5.16_; and (b) each Indemnified Party
shall be a third-party beneficiary of the terms set forth in _Article VIII_.

 



\- 91 - Section 10.13 _Guarantee_. Raymond James hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Seller the timely and punctual payment and
performance when and as due of all obligations of the Purchaser under this
Agreement, and shall be liable for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation of the Purchaser under this Agreement. The Seller
shall not be required to proceed first against the Purchaser before proceeding
against Raymond James in respect of such claims brought pursuant to this
Agreement. The obligations of Raymond James shall not be discharged,
impaired, or affected in any way, except to the extent that the Purchasers
obligations would be discharged, impaired, or affected by any act or thing
which would operate as a discharge of Raymond James as a matter of
law. Raymond James hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against the Purchaser, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this _Section
10.13_.
