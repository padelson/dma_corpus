acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being acknowledged and agreed that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one primary counsel and one local counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if the Third Party
