During the period of the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule,
upon reasonable prior notice, the Members and the Member Representative shall
cooperate with the Purchaser and its authorized representatives, including by
providing on a timely basis information reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation of the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule.

  


 

  

(b) The Member Representative shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of
the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule during which to notify the Purchaser of
any dispute of any item contained in the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule,

line item. During the period of the preparation of such notice of dispute,
upon reasonable prior notice, the Purchaser shall provide the Member
Representative and its authorized representatives with reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to the relevant books, records, facilities,
employees and accountants of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and otherwise cooperate with the Member
Representative and its authorized representatives, including by providing on a
timely basis information reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation of such notice.

  

  

 

22  

  

(c) If the Member Representative does not notify the Purchaser of any such
dispute within such thirty (30) day period, the Preliminary Adjustment
Schedule shall be deemed to be the Final Adjustment Schedule.

  


 

  

(d) If the Member Representative notifies the Purchaser of any such dispute
within such thirty (30) day period, the Purchaser and the Member
Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such dispute as
promptly as possible, and upon such resolution, the Final Adjustment Schedule
shall be prepared in accordance with the agreement of the Purchaser and the
Member Representative.

  


 

  

(e) If the Purchaser and the Member Representative are unable to resolve any
dispute regarding the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule within fifteen (15) days
(or such longer period as the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall
mutually agree in writing), following notice of such dispute, such dispute
shall be submitted to, and all items disputed by the Members in the Member
Representative's dispute notice shall be resolved by, an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser
and the Member Representative (such accounting firm so selected, the
"Arbitrator"). Such resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties. The
Purchaser and the Member Representative shall instruct the Arbitrator to make
a final determination of Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital, the Net Working Capital Deficit, if
any, or the Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, and the Adjustment Amount
based solely on the items that are in dispute and not on the basis of an
independent review and that, in resolving such items in dispute and in
determining Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness, Transaction
Expenses, Net Working Capital, the Net Working Capital Deficit, if any, or the
Net Working Capital Surplus, if any, and the Adjustment Amount, the Arbitrator
shall not assign to any item in dispute a value that is (A) greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or
the Member Representative, on the other hand, or (B) less than the smallest
value for such item assigned by the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Member
Representative, on the other hand. The Parties shall cooperate with the
Arbitrator to facilitate its resolution of the disputed items, including by
providing such information, data, work papers and access to books and records,
personnel and accountants as the Arbitrator may request. The Parties shall
instruct the Arbitrator to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete its
work within thirty (30) days following its engagement. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Arbitrator (1) shall be borne by the Member Representative in
the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of all such disputed items so
submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Member Representative (as
finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
such items so submitted and (2) shall be borne by the Purchaser in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are successfully disputed by the Member Representative (as
finally determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
all such items so submitted. If any disputes are submitted to the Arbitrator
pursuant to this _Section 3.6(e)_ , the Final Adjustment Schedule shall be
prepared in accordance with the decision of the Arbitrator and, to the extent
applicable, the agreement of the Purchaser and the Member Representative.

  

  

 

23  

  

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following the determination of the Final
Adjustment Schedule in accordance with this _Section 3.6_ :

  


 

  

(i) If the Adjustment Amount is positive, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Members the Adjustment Amount, net of applicable withholding taxes, if any, by
wire transfer or delivery of immediately available funds and in accordance
with the Closing Date Payment Statement. Upon payment of such Adjustment
Amount by the Purchaser to the Members, the Purchaser shall be fully released
and discharged of any obligation to the Members with respect to payment of the
Adjustment Amount, and the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the balance
of the Net Working Capital Escrow to the Members.

  


 

  

(ii) To the extent the Adjustment Amount is negative, (A) the Purchaser shall
be entitled to payment of the Adjustment Amount, first out of the Net Working
Capital Escrow Amount and, if such Net Working Capital Escrow Amount is
unavailable, exhausted or insufficient to pay in full the Adjustment Amount,
then out of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, and (B) the Purchaser and the Member
Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to pay to the Purchaser such Adjustment Amount and to pay to the Members any
remaining portion of the Net Working Capital Escrow Amount.

  


 

  

(iii) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 3.6(f)_ will be deemed to be
adjustments for Tax purposes to the Purchase Price. In addition, any payment
made pursuant to this _Section 3.6(f)_ shall include an additional amount of
simple interest equal to the amount of interest that such payment would have
earned had it earned interest at the rate per annum of the WSJ Prime Rate as
reported in the Wall Street Journal on the Closing Date, from the Closing Date
through the date of such payment.

  


 

  

Section 3.7 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Member Representative, Escrow Agent, and
the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be
deducted or withheld, from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The Purchaser shall
notify the Member Representative prior to making any such withholdings, except
with respect to payments in the nature of compensation to be made to employees
or former employees. The Purchaser, Company and Member Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such withholdings.

respect to, any violation of any applicable Law or other requirement of a

Section 6.2 _Authorization_. The Purchaser has the rights, power, authority
and capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Purchaser Ancillary
Documents, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,

Documents by the Purchaser, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all required
action on the part of the Purchaser. This Agreement has been, and the
Purchaser Ancillary Documents shall be, as of the Closing Date, duly executed
and delivered by the Purchaser and do or shall, as the case may be, constitute
the valid and binding agreements of the Purchaser, enforceable against the
Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar Laws affecting the enforceability of
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles and the discretion
of courts in granting equitable remedies.

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and the

accelerated obligation would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse impact on the ability of the Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, or by the Purchaser Ancillary Documents,
except for compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act.

  

  

 

47  

  

Section 6.4 _Debt Financing_. Purchaser has delivered to the Company a duly
executed copy of (i) the Commitment Letter of Jefferies Finance LLC (the "Debt
Financing Source") dated as of the date of this Agreement (the "Commitment
Letter") and (ii) the Fee Letter of the Debt Financing Source dated as of even
date with the Commitment Letter (as redacted to remove the fee amounts,
alternative transaction fee provisions, pricing caps, the rates and amounts
included in the "market flex" and other economic terms that could not
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability or termination of the Debt
Financing, the "Redacted Fee Letter"), in each case, including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments to such letters in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (collectively, the "Debt Letters"), to provide Purchaser with
debt financing in the amount set forth therein for the purpose of financing
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses
(being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing"). The Debt Letters are
in full force and effect and have not been amended or modified (provided, that
the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions contained in the
Redacted Fee Letter shall not be deemed to constitute a modification or
amendment of the Commitment Letter), and the commitments set forth therein
have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any way. The Debt Letters are a valid
and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser,
the other parties thereto, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and

arrangements related to the Debt Financing that would reasonably be expected
to affect the availability of such financing, other than as expressly provided
in the Debt Letters. No event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of the
Purchaser under the Debt Letters. The aggregate proceeds from the Debt
Financing, together with cash on hand, will provide Purchaser with sufficient
funds required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
on the Closing Date. The Debt Letters contain all of the conditions precedent
to the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources thereunder to make the Debt
Financing available to Purchaser on the terms therein. Purchaser does not know
of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in
the Purchaser not being able to satisfy on the Closing Date any of the
conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing required to be satisfied by
Purchaser as set forth in the Commitment Letter.

to occur, of any event, the occurrence or failure of which would be likely to
cause any representation or warranty of the Company, the Members or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate at
any time during the Pre-Closing Period in such a manner as would result in the
failure to satisfy the condition specified in _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Member Representative shall,
without cost to the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser, prepare or
cause to be prepared and the Company shall cause to be filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all income Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for taxable years or
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and required to be filed after
the Closing (such Tax Returns, the "Seller Filed Tax Returns"), and the
Members shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such
income Tax Returns. Except for the Tax Returns described in the preceding
sentence, the Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into
account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to
be initially filed after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions) by
or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable
period beginning on or before the Closing Date (such Tax Returns the
"Purchaser Filed Tax Returns"), and the Purchaser shall remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns, _provided_ that to the
extent such Taxes shown as due on any Purchaser Filed Tax Returns are for any
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or for the portion of
the Straddle Period, as determined pursuant to _Section 7.11(c)_ , ending on
the Closing Date, then, subject to _Section 7.11(b)_ , such Taxes shall be
payable solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount upon the written request of
the Purchaser to the Member Representative and Escrow Agent (which request
shall set forth in reasonable detail the computation of the amount payable
from the Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to this _Section 7.11(a)_ ), except
to the extent (i) such Taxes were reflected as a current liability on the
Final Adjustment Schedule and taken into account as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price or (ii) Purchaser is bearing any such Taxes under _Section
7.11(h)_. Purchaser shall pay to the Members any Taxes of the Company due in
respect of a Seller Filed Tax Return that is required to be initially filed
after the Closing Date (taking into account extensions) to the extent such
Taxes were reflected as a current liability on the Final Adjustment Schedule
at least five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of such Seller Filed Tax
Return. All Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.11(a)_ shall be prepared
and filed in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

  

  

 

57  

  

(b) _Tax Return Review and Dispute Resolution_. The Member Representative
shall provide any Tax Return described in the first sentence of _Section
7.11(a)_ to Purchaser for review not less than thirty (30) days prior to the
date such Tax Return is required to be filed with the appropriate tax
authorities (taking into account all extensions properly obtained). Purchaser
shall promptly review such Tax Return, and the Member Representative shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments received from the Purchaser, to
the extent those comments are consistent with the Company's past practices as
consistent with _Section 7.11(d)_. Purchaser shall provide any Purchaser Filed
Tax Return with respect to (x) income Taxes or (y) for which an amount in
excess of $15,000 would be due and payable from the Indemnity Escrow Amount
pursuant to _Section 7.11(a)_ or the indemnification provisions of Article XI
to the Member Representative for review not less than thirty (30) days prior
to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed with the appropriate tax
authorities (taking into account all extensions properly obtained). The Member
Representative shall promptly review such Tax Return, and Purchaser shall
accept and implement any reasonable comments received from the Member
Representative, to the extent those comments are consistent with the Company's
past practices and consistent with _Section 7.11(d)_ and _Section 7.11(g)_. No
election may be made under Section 1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act, or
any similar Law or guidance (including pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 301.9100-22T), to have the provisions of Section 1101 of the
Bipartisan Budget Act apply to any Tax Returns of the Company filed for any
taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018.

  


 

  

(c) _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of _Section 7.11(a)_ , whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for any Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company that includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date
(a "Straddle Period"), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) in the
case of any sales or use Taxes, value-added Tax, employment Taxes, withholding
Taxes, Taxes arising by reason of a specific event or transaction, and any Tax
based on or measured by income, receipts or profits (other than Transfer Taxes
which are governed by _Section 7.11(h)_ ), deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the taxable period ended at the end of the Closing Date
(determined using a "closing of the books" method); and (ii) in the case of
any Tax not described in clause (i), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period.

  


 

  

(d) _Tax Treatment_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company
will be considered as terminated pursuant to Section 708(b)(1) of the Code as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will be
required to file a final partnership Tax Return for the taxable year ending
upon the Closing Date and (ii) the Member Representative will be responsible
for causing to be prepared such Tax Return under _Section 7.11(a)_. The
Parties further acknowledge and agree that the sale of the Membership
Interests hereunder shall be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (i)
as to each Member, as a sale of the Member's partnership interest in the
Company and (ii) as to the Purchaser, as a deemed distribution of all of the
Company's assets to the Members followed immediately thereafter by the
purchase by the Purchaser of such assets, in each case in accordance with
Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. The Purchaser, the
Company, and the Members will file all income Tax Returns and information
reports in a manner consistent with the tax treatment described in this

58  

  

(e) _Tax Contests_.

  


 

  

(i) The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Member Representative upon receipt
by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates of written notice of any inquiry,
claim, assessment, audit, administrative or judicial proceeding relating to
Taxes for which the Members are required to provide indemnification under
_Section 11.1_ , for any Taxes for which the Members would include in their
income on a flow through basis or for any claims for refunds of Taxes that are
the property of the Members pursuant to _Section 7.11(i)_ (including claims
related to refunds of any flow through Taxes) (each, a "Tax Matter"). So long
as such Tax Matter relates solely to Taxes for taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date and (i) relates to an income Tax Return or (ii) the
Purchaser does not in good faith believe that the potential Purchaser Losses
related to such Tax Matter could likely exceed the portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow, and there is no Litigation
Condition (other than clause (iii) of the definition of Litigation Condition)
that would prevent an Indemnifying Party from controlling a Third Party Claim
if _Section 11.3_ were to apply, the Member Representative shall have the
authority, at expense of the Members, to represent the interests of the
Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to such Tax Matter before any taxing
authority diligently and in good faith and shall have the right to control the
defense, settlement, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Matter;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Matter, the Member
Representative shall (A) not amend any Tax Return in a manner which could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (B) in good faith,
allow the Purchaser to participate in such Tax Matter and make comments to the
Member Representative regarding the conduct of or positions taken with respect
to such Tax Matter, (C) not enter into any settlement or compromise without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (D) not contact any
customer, supplier or employee of the Purchaser or any other Indemnified Party
except with the Purchaser's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Member Representative shall
keep the Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of any Tax Matter for which the Member Representative
controls the defense, settlement, compromise or resolution thereof. If the
Member Representative declines to represent the interests of the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to any Tax Matter or with respect to any other
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit, administrative or judicial proceeding
relating to Taxes for which the Members are required to provide
indemnification hereunder (including from any escrow account), the Purchaser
may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to such Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser shall keep the Member Representative fully and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter for which the
Purchaser controls the defense, settlement, compromise or resolution thereof,
and will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise
or settlement with respect to a Tax Matter without the prior written consent
of the Member Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

59  

  

(ii) The Purchaser shall have the sole right to control any audit or
examination by any taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund or amend
any Tax Return, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for
additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or
relating to, the income, assets or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending after the Closing Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that with respect to any Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall
(A) not amend any Tax Return in a manner which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Members without the prior written consent of the Member
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, (B) in good faith, allow the Member Representative to make
comments to the Purchaser regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such audit, examination or other proceeding and (C) not enter into any
settlement or compromise without the prior written consent of the Member
Representative if such settlement or compromise would adversely affect the
Members, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

  


 

  

(iii) To the extent of any conflict between this _Section 7.11(e)_ and
_Section 11.3_ , this _Section 7.11(e)_ shall be controlling with respect to
any matters relating to Taxes.

  


 

  

(f) _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Member Representative and the Purchaser
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) timely sign and
deliver such certificates or forms as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce) or file Tax
Returns or reports with respect to any Transfer Taxes, (ii) assist the other
Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other Party is responsible for
preparing and filing under _Section 7.11(a)_ , and in connection therewith,
provide the other Party with any necessary powers of attorney (including
enabling the Member Representative to utilize the Company's existing tax
return preparation firm), (iii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending
any audits of, or disputes with any taxing authorities regarding any Tax
Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv) make available to the other
Party as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating
to Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) furnish the other Party with
copies of all relevant correspondence received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (vi) cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any Transfer Taxes.

  

  

 

60  

  

(g) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Parties hereto shall allocate the
Purchase Price among the assets of the Company in accordance with the Purchase
Price Allocation Methodology attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit_
_7.11(g)_. Within thirty (30) days following the determination of the Final
Adjustment Schedule, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Member
Representative an allocation of the adjusted Purchase Price (including any
liabilities treated as consideration for federal income tax purposes) among
the assets of the Company (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Purchaser shall
prepare such Allocation Schedule in accordance with _Exhibit_ _7.11(g)_ , the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. The Allocation
Schedule shall be final and binding on all Parties unless, within thirty (30)
days after delivery thereof to the Member Representative, the Member
Representative delivers a written notice to the Purchaser of its objections to
the Allocation Schedule. The Member Representative and the Purchaser shall
endeavor in good faith to resolve any disputed items. If the Member
Representative and the Purchaser cannot come to mutual agreement on the
Allocation Schedule, the matter shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in
accordance with substantially identical procedures as set forth for the
resolution of disputes in _Section 3.6(e)_. If the Member Representative
raises no objection to the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after
delivery thereof to the Member Representative, such Allocation Schedule
prepared by the Purchaser shall be binding on all Parties for all Tax
purposes. If the Member Representative raises an objection to the Allocation
Schedule within thirty (30) days after delivery thereof to the Member
Representative, such Allocation Schedule shall be binding on all Parties for
all Tax purposes upon mutual agreement of the Member Representative and the
Purchaser or resolution by the Arbitrator, as applicable.

including any penalties and interest, incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid by the Members.

  


 

  

(i) _Refunds_. Any refunds for Taxes (including any interest in respect
thereof actually received from a Taxing Authority), net of expenses and Taxes
incurred in connection with obtaining such refunds that are not reimbursed by
the Members hereunder, actually received by Purchaser, the Company or any
Subsidiary, and any amounts credited against Taxes to which Purchaser, the
Company of any of their Affiliates become entitled (including by way of any
amended tax return), related to, or resulting or arising, directly or
indirectly from any Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any period
prior to or including the Closing Date shall be property of the Members.
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries, to promptly
pay any such credit or refund that is allocable to the Members pursuant to
this _Section 7.11(i)_ for distribution to the Members.

  


 

  

(j) _Tax Elections and Amended Returns_. Purchaser, the Company and the

Purchaser shall have consulted with Member Representative in good faith as to
the requirements of applicable Law).

  

  

 

61  

  

(k) _Tax Indemnity_. The Members severally and not jointly shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from the following Taxes: (i)

provided that (A) Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and the

and abates penalties for past due sales and use Taxes prior to amending or
filing such Tax Returns and, to the extent reasonable given the circumstances,
by contacting customers and former customers for any applicable exemption
certificates with respect thereto, (B) Purchaser shall allow the Member
Representative to participate in such Tax Compliance Matters and shall provide
copies of all material written correspondence with respect thereto and (C)
Purchaser shall not initially submit any voluntary disclosure or similar
agreement relating to any Tax Compliance Matter or enter into any settlement
or compromise of any Tax Compliance Matter, in each case, without the prior

related to the foregoing shall be controlled by the Purchaser subject to the
preceding sentence. Any Taxes arising from or related to any Tax Compliance

favorable as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The Members will bear as a

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Letters, and shall
not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under the Debt Letters, if such amendment, modification or
waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (ii) imposes
new or additional terms or conditions or otherwise amends, modifies or expands
the terms or conditions precedent to the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or make the funding of
the Debt Financing less likely to occur. Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the Debt Letters and to negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Letters on the terms
and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter, (B) to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to it in such definitive agreements that are
within its control and (C) upon satisfaction of such conditions, to consummate
the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing.

  

  

 

64  

  

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Letters, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing (on terms
not materially less favorable to Purchaser, in its reasonable determination,
than the terms of the Debt Financing) from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing being replaced
that is still available, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (the "Alternate
Financing"). Purchaser shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies
of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative financing source
shall have committed to provide Purchaser with any portion of the Debt
Financing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the execution thereof.
Purchaser shall promptly provide a true, correct and complete copy of each
alternative financing commitment and engagement letter (each, a "New
Commitment Letter") to the Company. Any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter on the date hereof, as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced
(in whole or in part) by this _Section 7.15(b)_ , including any Alternative
Financing, and references to "Commitment Letter" shall include such debt
commitment letters as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced (in whole
or in part) by this _Section 7.15(b)_ , including any New Commitment Letter.

efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and shall give the Company prompt
notice: (i) of any breach of any provisions of any of the Commitment Letter or
definitive document related to the Debt Financing by any party to the
Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (ii)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from the
Debt Financing Source with respect to any (A) actual or anticipated breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or
(B) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Letters
with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the
Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any
reason all or any portion of the Debt Financing would reasonably be expected
not to be obtained by the Purchaser on the terms and conditions in, and in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by, the Commitment Letter. As soon as
reasonably practicable, but in any event within three (3) Business Days
following the date the Company delivers to Purchaser a written request,
Purchaser shall provide any non-privileged information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Purchaser will not, and will not
permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the
Company, take any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably
be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of
the Debt Financing.

  

  

 

65  

  

(d) Upon the request of Purchaser, the Company and the Members shall provide
reasonable cooperation and assistance to the Purchaser in connection with the
arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Debt Letters or any Alternate
Financing, including (i) causing the senior officers of the Company to assist
in the preparation for and participate upon reasonable advance notice at
mutually agreeable times in a reasonable number of informational meetings, due
diligence sessions and presentations (including roadshows) with lenders,
prospective investors and rating agencies and road show meetings, (ii)
furnishing information (including financial statements) reasonably required to
be included in, and providing reasonable assistance with the preparation of,
lender information memoranda and similar documents, including (A) audited
consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the three (3)
most recent fiscal years ended at least ninety (90) days prior to the Closing
Date, (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each subsequent interim quarterly period ended at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date (and the corresponding period
for the prior fiscal year) and (C) reasonably available information to prepare
customary pro forma financial information for inclusion in any document in
order to obtain the Debt Financing or any Alternate Financing ( _provided_
that the Company shall not be required to prepare any pro forma financial
statements), and (iii) providing such other information as the Purchaser may
reasonably request with respect to the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 7.15(d)_ shall require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to (v) cause its directors and managers to adopt or pass any
resolutions or consents other than any resolutions or consents necessary to
authorize the officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
take such actions as are necessary to comply with the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' obligations herein (other than approval of the agreements,
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained),
(w) provide any assistance to the extent it would unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (x)
execute or deliver any certificate, document or agreement in connection with

offering or information document or (z) provide any legal opinion or other
opinion of counsel, or any information that would, in its good faith opinion,
result in a violation of applicable law or loss of attorney-client privilege.
Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Company, any Subsidiary, any Member, any of their respective Affiliates or
the officers, employees, representatives and advisors of any of the foregoing,
in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to this _Section
7.15_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that none of the Members, the
Company, their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives shall incur or be responsible for any liability to
any Person under the Debt Letters or any actions taken in connection with the
Debt Letters and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Members, the
Company, their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Debt Financing, except in the event any such liability or Loss arose out of or
resulted from the willful misconduct, fraud or gross negligence of any such
Persons and except for liability of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Closing.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 7.15_ or anything else in this Agreement: (i) no
liability or obligation (including any liability or obligation to pay any
commitment or other similar fee) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any certificate, document or instrument related to the Debt Financing
will be effective until the Closing, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to take any action under any certificate,
document or instrument that is not contingent upon consummation of the Closing
(including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the Closing)
or that would be effective prior to the Closing; and (ii) in no event will the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay any commitment fee or
other fee or payment to obtain consent, or to incur any liability with respect
to, or cause or permit any Lien to be placed on any of their respective assets
in connection with, the Debt Financing prior to the Closing.

(b) by written notice from the Company to the Purchaser, in the event the

contained herein required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing,
which failure would cause the condition set forth in _Section 8.3(c)_ not to
be satisfied or (ii) materially breaches any of its representations and
warranties contained herein, which breach would cause the condition set forth

its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ ;

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ if the Company or any Member is

(c) by written notice from the Purchaser to the Company, in the event the
Members or the Company (i) fail to perform in any material respect any of
their agreements contained herein required to be performed by them at or prior
to the Closing, which failure would cause the condition set forth in _Section
8.2(c)_ not to be satisfied or (ii) materially breach any of their
representations and warranties contained herein, which breach would cause the
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, which failure or

notified the Company of its intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 10.1(c)_ ; _provided_ , that the Purchaser shall not have the

or breach would give rise to a failure of a condition set forth in _Section
8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.3(c)_ ;

  


 

  

(d) by written notice by the Company to the Purchaser given after the date and
time specified for the Closing in _Section 9.1_ (including as extended by the
Purchaser in accordance with _Section 9.1_ ), if (i) the conditions set forth
in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) have been

this Agreement through the end of such three (3) Business Day period; or

Company, as the case may be, in the event the Closing has not occurred on or

the same Party for this purpose) seeking such termination.

  


 

  

Section 10.2 _Reverse Termination Fee_.

  


 

  

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree (i) that the provisions contained in

this Agreement and are included herein in order to induce the Company and the
Members to enter into this Agreement and to reimburse the Company and the
Members for incurring the costs and expenses related to entering into this
Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ constitute
liquidated damages, represent the Parties' estimate of the Losses that would
be suffered by the Company and the Members in the event that payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee becomes required and do not constitute a penalty. If
Purchaser fails to pay the Reverse Termination Fee and any of the Members, the
Company or any combination thereof commences an action to obtain the Reverse
Termination Fee that results in a judgment against Purchaser for the Reverse
Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then Purchaser shall pay such Party's
or Parties' out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in connection with such action, and
shall include an additional amount of simple interest equal to the amount of
interest that the Reverse Termination Fee payment would have earned had it

Wall Street Journal on the date such payment was required to be made through
the date of such payment.

  

  

 

72  

  

(c) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, if the Reverse
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ : (i) receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee and the payment in full of any reimbursement, expense
or interest obligations pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ , if any, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company, the Members or any of their Affiliates against
Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective Affiliates or
any of the former, current, or future general or limited partners,
shareholders or equityholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents or any former, current or future general
or limited partner, direct or indirect shareholder or equityholder, manager,
member, director, officer, employee, Affiliate, representative or agent of any
of the foregoing (collectively, "Purchaser's Related Parties") in connection
with the termination of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (ii) under no circumstances shall any of the Members, the
Company or any of their Affiliates be entitled to collect the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one occasion; and (iii) except for the payment by
Purchaser of the Reverse Termination Fee and any reimbursement, expense or
interest obligations pursuant to _Section 10.2(b)_ , in no event shall
Purchaser's Related Parties be subject to (nor shall any of the Members, the
Company or any of their Affiliates seek to recover) liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Commitment Letter
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing), any breach of
this Agreement or the Commitment Letter, or any failure of such transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Commitment Letter to be consummated, and
all such liabilities and obligations shall be deemed waived. Subject to the
rights of the parties to the Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, the
Parties (solely in their capacities as parties to this Agreement) and their
respective Affiliates shall not have any rights or claims against the Debt
Financing Sources or their Affiliates in their respective capacities as
lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing, and the Debt
Financing Sources and their Affiliates shall not have any rights or claims
against the Parties and their respective Affiliates, in each case, in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law, equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise.

  


 

  

Section 10.3 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_. Each Party hereby
acknowledges that the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby are special, unique and of extraordinary character and
that, in the event that any Party violates or fails or refuses to perform any
covenant or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching Party may be
without an adequate remedy at law. In the event that any Party violates or
fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party
herein, the non-breaching Party or Parties may, subject to the terms hereof
(including the preceding _Section 10.2_ ), in addition to any remedy at law
for damages or other relief, institute and prosecute an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such covenant or
agreement or seek any other equitable relief.

  


 

  

Section 10.4 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party or its partners,
officers, directors, managers or stockholders, except for obligations under
_Section 7.6_ (Public Announcements), _Section 12.1_ (Notices), _Section 12.5_
(Controlling Law; Amendment), _Section 12.6_ (Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.)
and _Section 12.13_ (Transaction Costs) and this _Section 10.4_ , all of which
shall survive the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or any
breach hereof; _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that in no event may
the monetary damages payable by the Purchaser in respect of a breach of this
Agreement related to failure to obtain the Debt Financing exceed the Reverse
Termination Fee.

satisfied from the Change of Control Escrow; or

  


 

  

(iv) any claim by a Member or a recipient of a Change of Control Payment that
the amount of proceeds or Change of Control Payments paid pursuant to this
Agreement was erroneous, so long as such error was not caused by Purchaser's
(or, after the Closing, the Company's) breach of this Agreement or any
Purchaser Ancillary Document

  


 

  

(collectively, the "Purchaser Losses." The amount of all Purchaser Losses
shall be determined net of the aggregate amount of all payments made to (or on
behalf of) Purchaser under the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy.

  


 

  

Section 11.2 _Indemnification Obligations of the Purchaser_. From and after
the Closing, the Member Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified, held
harmless and defended by the Purchaser, subject to _Section 11.8_ from,
against and in respect of, any and all Losses incurred, suffered, sustained or
required to be paid relating to or arising from:

  


 

  

(a) any misrepresentation, inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Purchaser in _ARTICLE VI_ of this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(b) any breach or failure by the Purchaser to comply with, perform or
discharge any obligation, agreement or covenant made by the Purchaser in this
Agreement

  


 

  

(collectively, the "Member Losses").

  

  

 

74  

  

Section 11.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.

  


 

  

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding against such Indemnified Party by a third
party (such action, a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall, if a
claim with respect thereto is to be made against any Party obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE XI_ (the "Indemnifying
Party"), give such Indemnifying Party written notice of such Third Party Claim
in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances then known to such
Indemnified Party. In the event of a claim by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
such notice shall be provided to the Member Representative. The failure to
give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices such
Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and
resolve such Third Party Claim, at such Indemnifying Party's expense and with
counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, by
giving the Indemnified Party written notice of the assumption of the defense
within twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Party gives notice of the Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in such defense at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (i) which
includes criminal charges, (ii) that does not solely seek and continue to
solely seek monetary damages, (iii) that involves a customer, supplier or
employee of the Indemnified Party, (iv) if the Indemnified Party is a
Purchaser Indemnified Party and the Purchaser reasonably believes potential
Purchaser Losses related thereto could likely exceed the portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow, (v) if the
Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that an actual conflict exists
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third Party Claim, or (vi) if the defense of such Third
Party Claim has been assumed by the insurance carrier in accordance with the
Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy (the conditions set forth in clauses (i)
through (vi) are, collectively, the "Litigation Conditions"). If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided
in this _Section 11.3(a)_ , the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim (though not as counsel of record, and subject to all
privileges); _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A) any of the Litigation
Conditions come into existence or (B) the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will
be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection
with such defense. In the event the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against
such Third Party Claim (provided that the Indemnifying Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim, though not as counsel of record, and
subject to all privileges). The Indemnifying Party may not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
unless such settlement involves solely the payment of money (and not any
admission of guilt or liability) and includes a full release of the
Indemnified Party in respect of a Third Party Claim for which the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense. The Indemnified Party may not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume, or is not permitted to assume, and
maintain the defense of such Third Party Claim, or such settlement includes an
unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers, directors,
managers, employees and Affiliates from all liability arising out of such
claim. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
shall at all times use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, reasonably
apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are maintaining
and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect to the defense of
any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party will be required to
provide cooperation or furnish any records or other information that would (1)
jeopardize the attorney client, work product or similar privilege of the
Person in possession or control of such records or other information or (2)
contravene any confidentiality agreement, nondisclosure agreement or similar
obligation of the Person in possession or control of such records or other
information.

  

  

 

75  

  

(b) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to payment pursuant
hereto other than in respect of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party
shall send written notice of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party
(or to the Member Representative if the Indemnifying Party is any of the
Members). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim. The failure by
any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim made pursuant to this _Section 11.3(b)_. In
the event the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE XI_
or the amount thereof, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
under this _ARTICLE XI_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, or arrange to
have paid, pursuant to _Section 11.5(b)_ , the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount
of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date
when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes finally
determined. In the event the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim as provided above, as promptly as
possible, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying Party shall
establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement,
litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days
following the final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, or arrange to have paid, to the Indemnified
Party in immediately available funds pursuant to _Section 11.5(b)_ an amount
equal to such claim as determined hereunder.

  


 

  

Section 11.4 _Claims Period_. Any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement must be made by the giving of notice on or prior to the end of the
survival period applicable to such claim as determined pursuant to _Section
12.15._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the end of such survival
period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been notified in accordance with
_Section 12.1_ of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not
have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim shall
continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until
such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms
hereof.

  

  

 

76  

  

Section 11.5 _Liability Limits; Escrow Funds_.

  


 

  

(a) Without in any way limiting the right of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, the right of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties to indemnification is limited as follows:

  


 

  

(i) No indemnification shall be available to any of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under _Section 11.1(b)_ _(i)_ unless and until the aggregate Purchaser
Losses for which indemnification would otherwise be available to such
Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE XI_ exceed one half of one
percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), at which point
indemnification shall be available to such Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this _ARTICLE XI_ only for those Purchaser Losses in excess of the Deductible,
except that claims for breach of Fundamental Representations, or Actual Fraud
committed by a Member, shall not be subject to the Deductible.

  


 

  

(ii) Except with respect to claims for breaches of Fundamental Representations
or Actual Fraud by a Member, the sole and exclusive source of recovery for
Purchaser Losses under _Section 11.1_ shall be the Indemnity Escrow and in no
event shall any Member or any other party have any liability (irrespective of
the nature of such liability, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise)
therefor except if, and to the extent that, there are funds available for such
indemnification in the Indemnity Escrow, and the maximum Purchaser Losses
indemnifiable therefor shall be an amount equal to the initial Indemnity
Escrow Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 11.5(a)(ii)_ shall
not limit the Purchaser's ability to seek specific performance or other
injunctive or equitable relief otherwise permitted pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, any Purchaser Losses incurred as
a result of Actual Fraud by (x) a Capital Member (as to that Member only)
shall be satisfied first from the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount
remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and, if such remaining Indemnity Escrow
Amount is unavailable, exhausted or insufficient to satisfy in full the amount
of such Purchaser Losses, then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may, in their
sole discretion, seek recourse against such Member for the amount of such
unsatisfied Purchaser Losses and (y) a non-Capital Member (as to that Member
only) may be satisfied only by seeking recourse against such Member for the
amount of such unsatisfied Purchaser Losses; _provided_ _further_ that the
liability of any Member pursuant to the foregoing shall in no event exceed the
aggregate proceeds actually received by such Member under this Agreement and
_provided_ _further_ that such recourse against the Members shall be on a
several and not a joint basis (up to the aggregate proceeds actually received
by such Member); _provided_ _further_ that in the case of Actual Fraud, each
Member shall only be responsible for its or his own Actual Fraud.

  

  

 

77  

  

(b) On or promptly after the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall direct the Escrow
Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow to the Capital Members (in
accordance with the Closing Date Payment Statement), an amount equal to the
balance of the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow, if
any, less (1) any then pending or unresolved claims for indemnification under
this _ARTICLE XI_ that have been asserted by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties; and (2) $300,000.00 ("Extended Indemnity Escrow Amount"). From and
after the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, the Extended
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be available only to satisfy claims in respect
of those matters on _Part 2_ of _Schedule A_ hereto to which the Extended
Indemnity Escrow applies. On or promptly after the date that is eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Member Representative
shall direct the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow to the
Capital Members (in accordance with the Closing Date Payment Statement) an
amount equal to the balance of the Extended Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining
in the Indemnity Escrow, if any, less any then pending or unresolved claims
for indemnification under _ARTICLE XI_ or claims with respect to matters on
_Part 2_ of _Schedule A_ hereto that have been asserted by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties. Any unreleased funds remaining in the Escrow Funds shall
be retained by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

  


 

  

(c) On or promptly after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date (unless requested earlier by the Purchaser in its reasonable
discretion), the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall direct the
Escrow Agent to release from the Change of Control Escrow to an account
designated in writing by Purchaser, for further disbursement by Purchaser
through payroll processing to each of the eligible recipients of the Change of
Control Payments (subject to applicable withholding Taxes to the extent
applicable) in an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment payable to
each such eligible recipient pursuant to the terms of his/her Change of
Control Agreement with the Company. To the extent any portion of the Change of
Control Escrow Amount is not distributable to any recipient (whether due to
forfeiture or otherwise), on or promptly after the date that is one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date (or such earlier date, if any, as is
requested by the Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
11.5(c)_ ), the Purchaser and the Member Representative shall direct the
Escrow Agent to release such remaining portion to the Capital Members (in
accordance with the Closing Date Payment Statement). To the extent the Change
of Control Escrow Amount is less than the aggregate amount of the Change of
Control Payments, then at least five (5) Business Days before such one hundred
eightieth (180th) day (or such earlier date, if any, as is requested by the
Purchaser pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 11.5(c)_ ), the
Capital Members shall deposit or cause to be deposited the amount of the
shortfall in the Change of Control Escrow.

  


 

  

 

78  

  

(d) With respect to any Losses payable to Purchaser or the applicable
Governmental Entity pursuant to _Section 7.11(l)_ , the Purchaser and the
Member Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the designated Governmental
Entity or the Purchaser, as applicable, an amount equal to such Losses, first
out of the Sales Tax Escrow, and if the Sales Tax Escrow is exhausted or
insufficient to pay an amount equal to such Losses, then out of the Indemnity
Escrow in accordance with _ARTICLE XI_ hereof. Upon the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, each Member shall be fully released and discharged of any
obligation to the Purchaser with respect to any Losses referred to in _Section
7.11(l)_ hereof. Within three (3) Business Days following the second
anniversary of the Closing, the Purchaser and Member Representative shall
deliver a joint written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Sales Tax Escrow to the Capital Members an amount equal to the balance
remaining in the Sales Tax Escrow, if any, less the amount of funds that are
then subject to a request by Purchaser for the Member Representative's
approval of a Tax Compliance Matter or are otherwise the subject of a then
pending audit of a Tax Compliance Matter contemplated by _Part 1_ of _Schedule
A_ hereto. The establishment of the Sales Tax Escrow and the foregoing
provisions of this Agreement relating thereto shall in no way be deemed to be
an admission by the Company or the Members that any such sales and use Taxes
are owed, due or payable.

  


 

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (x) the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover from the Indemnity Escrow
or the Sales Tax Escrow with respect to breaches of any of the representations
and warranties contained in _Section 4.15_ (other than _Sections_ _4.15(a)(x)_
, _(a)(xi)_ , _(a)(xii)_ or _(b)_ ) other than with respect to Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing or for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
as determined pursuant to _Section 7.11(c)_ and (y) no indemnification shall
be available to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Taxes resulting from
any transactions occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business.

  


 

  

Section 11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Parties agree that, excluding (a) any
right to specific performance under _Section 10.3_ (excluding for this purpose
any monetary or other remedy at law), (b) any claim for breach of the Non-
Solicit Agreement or the Non-Compete Agreements or (c) any claim for Actual
Fraud, from and after the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
_ARTICLE XI_ provide the sole and exclusive remedy as to all claims of either
the Members and the Member Representative, on the one hand, or the Purchaser,
on the other hand, arising from or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (a "Covered Matter") (irrespective of the
nature of the claim, whether in contract, tort or otherwise). After the
Closing, no Covered Matter will give rise to any right of any Party to rescind
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. The Purchaser
and the Members and Member Representative waive to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws, any other remedies for monetary damages under
any legal theory that might otherwise be available to them in respect of any
Covered Matter under any state or federal law or arising under, or based upon,
any common law. In the event that the foregoing waiver is not effective for
any reason, then the Purchaser and the Members and Member Representative agree
that all of the limitations of liability contained in this _ARTICLE XI_ ,
including, without limitation, those regarding survival, thresholds, caps and
deductibles, as well as the procedural steps set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_ ,
shall apply to any monetary remedy available to the Purchaser and the Members
or Member Representative.

  

  

 

79  

  

Section 11.7 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any Purchaser
Losses subject to indemnification under _Section 11.1_ shall be calculated net
of (a) any net cash Tax Benefit inuring to any Purchaser Indemnified Party on
account of such Purchaser Loss to the extent that the Tax Benefit is realized
or utilized in the year in which claim for indemnification is made and (b) any
third party insurance proceeds actually recovered by Purchaser (net of any
deductible amounts, increases in premiums and costs, expenses and Taxes paid
or incurred with respect to such proceeds). In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any
Purchaser Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then
a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly
to the Members net of any Purchaser Losses incurred by the Indemnified Party
for which such Indemnified Party was not indemnified hereunder.

  


 

  

Section 11.8 _Disclaimer of Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement, any Purchaser Ancillary Document or any Member
Ancillary Document to the contrary, but without limiting any coverage
available under the Purchaser RandW Insurance Policy, following the Closing, no
Person shall be liable to any other Person arising out of or relating to the
breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement, any Purchaser Ancillary Document or any Member
Ancillary Document (and the definitions of Purchaser Losses and Member Losses
shall not include) for any punitive damages of such other Person, except to
the extent awarded to a third party.

  


 

  

Section 11.9 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payment made
pursuant to _Section 7.11_ or this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

confirmation of receipt by recipient at a correct, current facsimile number or

incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in full herein.

  


 

  

Section 12.3 _Assignment; Successors in Interest_. No assignment or transfer
by any Party of such Party's rights and obligations hereunder shall be made
except with the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that
the Purchaser shall, without the obligation to obtain the prior written
consent of any other Party, be entitled to assign this Agreement or all or any
part of its rights or obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of the
Purchaser or to its Debt Financing Sources for collateral purposes (in which
each case the Purchaser nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations hereunder). This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, and any reference to a Party
shall also be a reference to the successors and permitted assigns thereof.

  


 

  

Section 12.4 _Captions_. The titles, captions and table of contents contained

and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal Laws of the State
of Delaware without reference to its choice of law rules. This Agreement may
not be amended, modified or supplemented except by written agreement of the
Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendments or supplements to the
provisions of this Agreement which the Debt Financing Sources are expressly
made third-party beneficiaries pursuant to _Section 12.9_ shall be permitted
in a manner adverse to any Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates' representatives) without
the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Sources (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

 

82  

  

Section 12.6 _Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc_.

  


 

  

(a) Each Party hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any Legal Dispute
shall be brought only to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of Delaware or the federal courts located in the State of Delaware, and each
Party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding that is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. During the period a Legal Dispute is pending before a
court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect to such Legal Dispute or
any other Legal Dispute, including any counterclaim, cross-claim or
interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court.
Each Party hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in any Legal
Dispute, that (a) such Party is not subject thereto, (b) such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such court, (c) such
Party's property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or (e) the venue of such
action, suit or proceeding is improper. A final judgment in any action, suit
or proceeding described in this _Section 12.6_ following the expiration of any
period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding involving any Debt
Financing Sources (or any of their respective Affiliates or their or their
respective Affiliates' representatives) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Debt Financing shall be brought and
determined in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York
and that any such legal action or proceeding shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the
application of the laws of any other state; _provided_ , that if jurisdiction
is not then available in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in any
federal court located in the State of New York (and, in each case, any
appellate courts thereof). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to
the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or
proceeding involving any Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates' officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Debt Letters or the Debt Financing and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. Each of the parties agrees not to commence any
action, suit or proceeding involving any Debt Financing Sources (or any of
their respective Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates' officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives) relating thereto except in
the courts described above in New York, other than actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in New York as described herein. Each of the parties further
agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of
process and the parties further waive any argument that such service is
insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding involving any Debt
Financing Source (or any of their respective Affiliates or their or their
respective Affiliates' officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt
Letters or the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, (x) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the courts in New York as described herein for any reason, (y) that it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement,
the Debt Letters, the Debt Financing, or the subject matter hereof or thereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

Section 12.7 _Severability_. Any provision hereof that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of Law that renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

  


 

  

Section 12.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement or the terms hereof to produce or
account for more than one of such counterparts. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic imaging means, including email transmission by PDF, shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 12.9 _Enforcement of Certain Rights_. Nothing expressed or implied
herein is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any Person
other than the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any right,
remedy, obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement, or
result in such Person being deemed a third-party beneficiary hereof, except
with respect to the indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties and
Member Indemnified Parties pursuant to _ARTICLE XI_ and the release and waiver
for the benefit of the Company's Subsidiaries under _Section 7.14_. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective
Affiliates or their or their respective Affiliates' representatives) are
intended to benefit from, and shall be entitled to enforce, _Section 10.2(c)_
, _Section 12.5_ , _Section 12.6(b)_ this _Section 12.9_ , _Section 12.14_ and
_Section 12.16_ , solely to the extent applicable to the Debt Financing
Sources (or any of their respective Affiliates or their or their respective
Affiliates' representatives).

  


 

  

Section 12.10 _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension
or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of
the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by any Party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time.

  

  

 

84  

  

Section 12.11 _Integration_. This Agreement and the documents executed
pursuant hereto (including the Member Ancillary Documents and the Purchaser
Ancillary Documents) supersede all negotiations, agreements and understandings
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof (except for that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2017, by and
between the Purchaser and the Company, which the Parties agree will
automatically terminate as of the Closing and be of no further force or
effect) and constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
thereto.

  


 

  

Section 12.12 _Cooperation Following the Closing_. Following the Closing, each
Party shall deliver to the other Parties such further information and
documents and shall execute and deliver to the other Parties such further
instruments and agreements as any other Party shall reasonably request to
consummate or confirm the transactions provided for herein, to accomplish the
purpose hereof or to assure to any other Party the benefits hereof.

  


 

  

Section 12.13 _Transaction Costs_. Except as provided above or as otherwise
expressly provided herein, (a) the Purchaser shall pay its own fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection herewith and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the fees, costs and expenses of its financial advisors,
accountants and counsel, and (b) the fees costs and expenses of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and the Members incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid pursuant to _Section 3.5(e)_
hereof if the Closing occurs and by the Company or its Subsidiaries if the
Closing does not occur.

  


 

  

Section 12.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
any Legal Dispute that may arise under or in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Letters, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and
therefore it hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any such Legal Dispute.

  


 

  

Section 12.15 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Any
claim pursuant to _Section 11.1(b)(i)_ (whether in respect of Fundamental
Representations or any other representations or warranties) or _Section
11.2(a)_ shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months;
_provided_ that claims of Actual Fraud by a Member shall survive until the
applicable statute of limitations. Any other claim pursuant to _Section 11.1_
or _Section 11.2_ shall survive the Closing until the earlier of the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and the full performance
of the underlying covenant or agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of
the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement and to be performed at
or before the Closing shall survive the Closing Date, and there shall be no
liability in respect thereof on the part of any Party, its equity holders or
other representatives following the Closing.

  


 

  

Section 12.16 _Debt Financing Sources Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have
any liability to the Company or the Members relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at Law, or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company and the Members shall not have
any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder.

  

  

 

85  

  

Section 12.17 _Attorney-Client Privilege; Continued Representation_.

  


 

  

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Hinshaw and
Culbertson LLP and Goodwin Procter LLP ("Hinshaw/Goodwin") have acted as
counsel to the Company, the Member Representative, the Members and their
respective Affiliates in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  


 

  

(b) The Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to consent and agree to, Hinshaw/Goodwin
representing the Members or any of their direct or indirect equity holders
(collectively, the "Seller Parties") after the Closing, including with respect
to disputes in which the interests of the Seller Parties may be directly
adverse to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), and even though Hinshaw/Goodwin may have represented the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to any such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The Purchaser further consents and agrees to, and after the
Closing, agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to consent and agree
to, the communication by Hinshaw/Goodwin to the Seller Parties in connection
with any such representation of any fact known to Hinshaw/Goodwin arising by
reason of Hinshaw/Goodwin's prior representation of any of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives
and agrees not to assert, and agrees, after the Closing, to cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict of
interest arising from or in connection with (i) Hinshaw/Goodwin's prior
representation of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) Hinshaw/Goodwin's
representation of any of the Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing.

  


 

  

(d) The Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among Hinshaw/Goodwin, on the one hand, and the
Company, its Subsidiaries, any Seller Party, or any of their respective
directors, officers employees or other representatives, on the other hand,
that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under
this Agreement (collectively, the "Privileged Communications") shall be deemed
to be attorney-client privileged and that the Privileged Communications and
the expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Seller Parties, shall be controlled by the Member Representative on behalf of
the Seller Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

86  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a
third party other than a Seller Party, on the other hand, the Purchaser, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Purchaser, Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Member Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is legally required by governmental order or otherwise to
access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications,
the Purchaser shall, if permitted under applicable Law, promptly (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Member Representative in
writing (including by making specific reference to this _Section 12.17_ ) so
that the Member Representative can seek a protective order and the Purchaser
agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts, at the expense of the
Members, to assist therewith.

  


 

  

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Hinshaw/Goodwin
constitute property of its clients, only the Member Representative and the
Seller Parties shall hold such property rights and Hinshaw/Goodwin shall have
no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or other materials or any
Privileged Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Hinshaw/Goodwin, on the one hand, and the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

  


 

  

(g) The Purchaser agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries not to, (i) access or use the Privileged Communications,
including by way of review of any electronic data, communications or other
information, or by seeking to have the Seller or any Seller Party waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that the
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has the right to waive the
attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the Privileged
Communications from Hinshaw/Goodwin.

  


 

  

Section 12.18 _Member Representative_.

  


 

  

(a) By the execution and delivery hereof, including counterparts hereof, each
Member hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of such Member
with full powers of substitution to act in the name, place and stead of such
Member with respect to the performance on behalf of such Member under the
terms and provisions hereof and to do or refrain from doing all such further
acts and things, and to execute all such documents, as the Member
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with any
transaction contemplated hereunder, including the power to:

  


 

  

(i) act for each Member with respect to all indemnification matters referred
to herein, including the right to compromise or settle any such claim on
behalf of any Member;

  


 

  

(ii) act for each Member with respect to all Purchase Price adjustments
referred to herein;

  

  

 

87  

  

(iii) amend or waive any provision hereof (including any condition to Closing)
in any manner that does not differentiate among the Members;

  


 

  

(iv) employ, obtain and rely upon the advice of legal counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors as the Member Representative, in the sole
discretion thereof, deems necessary or advisable in the performance of the
duties of the Member Representative;

  


 

  

(v) receive and receipt for any portion of the Purchase Price or any other
payment due from the Purchaser to the Members pursuant to this Agreement;

  


 

  

(vi) incur any expenses, liquidate and withhold assets received on behalf of
the Members prior to their distribution to the Members to the extent of any
amount that the Member Representative deems necessary for payment of or as a
reserve against expenses, and pay such expenses or deposit the same in an
interest-bearing account established solely for such purpose;

  


 

  

(vii) receive all notices, communications and deliveries hereunder on behalf
of the Members; and

  


 

  

(viii) do or refrain from doing any further act or deed on behalf of each
Member that the Member Representative deems necessary or appropriate, in the
sole discretion of the Member Representative, relating to the subject matter
hereof as fully and completely as any Member could do if personally present
and acting as though any reference to any Member herein was a reference to the
Member Representative.

  


 

  

(b) The appointment of the Member Representative shall be deemed coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable, and any other Person (including the
Purchaser and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) may conclusively and
absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Member Representative
as the act of any Member in all matters referred to herein or in the Member
Ancillary Documents and Purchaser Ancillary Documents or related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. After the Closing any notice or
communication by the Purchaser to the Member Representative shall be deemed
notice and communication to all of the Members. Each Member hereby ratifies
and confirms that the Member Representative shall do or cause to be done by
virtue of such Member Representative's appointment as Member Representative of
such Member. The Member Representative shall act for each Member on all
matters set forth herein in the manner the Member Representative believes to
be in the best interest of such Member, but the Member Representative shall
not be responsible to any Member for any loss or damage any Member may suffer
by reason of the performance by the Member Representative of such Member
Representative's duties hereunder, other than loss or damage arising from
willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of such Member
Representative's duties hereunder.

  

  

 

88  

  

(c) Each Member hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Member
Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Member notwithstanding
any dispute or disagreement among the Members, and that any Person (including
the Purchaser and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties) shall be entitled to rely
on any and all action taken by the Member Representative hereunder without
liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Member. In the event the Member
Representative resigns or ceases to function in such capacity for any reason
whatsoever, then the successor Member Representative shall be the Person the
remaining Members appoint upon the execution and delivery to the other Parties
by such Person of a joinder to this Agreement (and any Member Ancillary
Documents and Purchaser Ancillary Documents to which the Member Representative
is a party); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event for any reason no
successor has been appointed within thirty (30) days following such
resignation or cessation, then any Member shall have the right to petition a
court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor Member
Representative. In the event of the actual or anticipated removal, resignation
or replacement of the Member Representative, the Members shall promptly notify
the Purchaser in writing. During the pendency of any vacancy in the position
of the Member Representative, any Person (including the Purchaser and the
other Purchaser Indemnified Parties) shall be entitled to rely conclusively
and without inquiry on the actions of the largest owner of Membership
Interests as of immediately prior to the Closing as if such Person were the
Member Representative hereunder. The Member Representative will incur no
liability of any kind with respect to any action or omission by the Member
Representative in connection with the Member Representative's services
pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, except in the
event of liability directly resulting from the Member Representative's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Member Representative shall not be
liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Members will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Member Representative
from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document
location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "Representative Losses")
arising out of or in connection with the Member Representative's execution and
performance of this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each
case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; provided, that in
the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have
been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Member Representative, the Member Representative will reimburse the Members
the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Member Representative by the Members, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Member Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund
and (ii) the Escrow Funds at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Members; provided, that while this section allows the
Member Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds,
this does not relieve the Members from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Member Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. In no event will the Member Representative be required to advance
its own funds on behalf of the Member or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the Member set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided
to the Member Representative under this _Section 12.18(c)_. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Member
Representative or the termination of this Agreement. To the extent that this
_Section 12.18(c)_ relieves or disclaims the Member Representative of any
liability or obligation it would otherwise owe to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under this Agreement, the Members, on a several and not joint basis,
shall assume such liability or obligation to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
and be responsible therefor.

  

  

 

89  

  

(d) Upon the Closing, the Company will wire $500,000.00 (the "Expense Fund")
to the Member Representative, which will be used for the purposes of paying
directly, or reimbursing the Member Representative for, any third party
expenses pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto. The
Members will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Member Representative any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Member Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the
Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Member Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following
the completion of the Member Representative's responsibilities, the Member
Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the Expense Fund to the
Members. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Members at the time of Closing.
