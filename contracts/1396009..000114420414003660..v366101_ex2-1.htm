--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) the liabilities and obligations of Sellers for payment or

Purchased Assets which are allocated to Purchasers pursuant to Section 2.8.

  



  

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchasers
shall not assume or become liable to Sellers or any other person for any
liabilities or obligations of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for those
liabilities of Sellers described in this Section 2.4.

  

 _ _

  

 _2.5 Excluded Liabilities_. Sellers shall retain, perform and
discharge when due all obligations and liabilities other than the
Assumed Liabilities, (whether direct or indirect, matured or unmatured, known
or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, whether now existing
or hereafter arising) (the " _Excluded Liabilities_ "). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and only for the avoidance of doubt, the matters
set forth on _Schedule 2.5_ are Excluded Liabilities.

  

 _ _

  

 _2.6 Payment of Purchase Price_ _._ At the Closing, Purchasers
shall pay or cause to be paid to Sellers Seven Hundred Twenty Million Dollars
($720,000,000) (such amount, as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section
7.8, the " _Purchase Price_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Sellers at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

  

 _ _

  

 _2.7 Inventory Adjustment to Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) For the purposes of the adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by this Section 2.7, the " _Target Inventory Amount_ " shall be
Thirty Eight Million Nine Hundred Eighty Five Thousand Forty Three Dollars
($38,985,043).

  



  

(b) No later than ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date,
Sellers shall deliver to Purchasers a written report setting forth
(i) Sellers\' estimate of the Inventory as of the Closing Date based upon
procedures consistent with Sellers\' past practice and with the calculation
of the Target Inventory Amount, and at Sellers\' joint and several expense;
(ii) a written calculation of the Inventory amounts (allocated separately to
each applicable site of the Business) and an account of such Inventory setting
forth the quantity and value of such Inventory (the aggregate value of such
Inventory at all sites of the Business being hereafter referred to as the "
_Estimated Inventory Amount_ "); and (iii) reasonable supporting documentation
used by Sellers to prepare such calculation (the " _Estimated Inventory
Statement_ "). The types of Inventory subject to adjustment under
the provisions of this Section 2.7 shall be as set forth on _Schedule
2.7(b)_. The value of the Inventory for purposes of this Section 2.7 shall be
determined in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with past practice
and the methodologies and procedures used to prepare the Financial Statements
and the Target Inventory Amount.

  



    

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) Upon receipt of the Estimated Inventory Statement, Purchasers
shall have sixty (60) Business Days to review the Estimated
Inventory Statement (and, if Purchasers so elect, to retain a third-party to
audit the Estimated Inventory Statement) (the " _Review Period_ "). The costs
and expenses associated with Purchasers\' review (and audit, if applicable) of
the Estimated Inventory Statement shall be borne by the Purchasers, jointly
and severally. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Purchasers may object to all or any portion of the Estimated Inventory Amount
by delivering to Sellers a written statement setting forth in reasonable
detail Purchasers\' objections thereto (the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If
Purchasers fail to deliver a Statement of Objections in accordance with this
Section 2.7(c) within the Review Period, the Estimated Inventory Amount
shall be deemed to have been accepted by Purchasers and shall be final and
binding on the parties. If Purchasers deliver the Statement of Objections to
Sellers within the Review Period, Purchasers and Sellers shall negotiate to
resolve such objections, and any objections that are resolved by written
agreement between Purchasers and Sellers shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties. The Estimated Inventory Amount included within the
Estimated Inventory Statement agreed upon by Purchasers and Sellers, or the
aggregate value of the Inventory at all applicable sites of the Business as
determined by the Independent Appraiser pursuant to Section 2.7(d) below is
referred to herein as the " _Final Inventory Amount_."

  



  

(d) If, for any reason, Sellers and Purchasers fail to reach an
agreement with respect to any of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections within twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer period as
Purchasers and Sellers may agree in writing) after delivery of the Statement
of Objections, then the matters still in dispute shall be promptly submitted
for final and binding arbitration to a partner at a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to Purchasers and Sellers (the
" _Independent Appraiser_ "). In the event Purchasers and Sellers are unable
to jointly agree on the Independent Appraiser, then the Independent Appraiser
shall be appointed, at the written request of any party, by the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ "). The Independent Appraiser shall act as
an arbitrator, and not an expert, and shall resolve only the matters still in
dispute. The place of arbitration shall be Wilmington, Delaware, and the
language of the arbitration shall be English. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Appraiser shall be borne in equal parts by Sellers, on one hand,
and by Purchasers on the other hand. The Independent Appraiser shall render
an award in writing as soon as practicable and, barring exceptional
circumstances, in any event within thirty (30) days (or such other time as
Purchasers and Sellers shall agree in writing) after its engagement, and the
award shall include a statement providing the reasons for and an explanation
of its determinations, relevant calculations made by the Independent
Appraiser and shall determine the Final Inventory Amount. Failure of the
Independent Appraiser to meet the thirty (30) day deadline to issue its award
shall not constitute a defense or objection to the enforcement or recognition
of the award. The award of the Independent Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon Sellers and Purchasers and may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

  



    

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment
Amount_ " shall mean an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to
the Final Inventory Amount minus the Target Inventory Amount.

  



  

(f) Within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
Final Inventory Amount, Purchasers shall pay Sellers the Net Adjustment
Amount if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, or Sellers shall pay
Purchasers the Net Adjustment Amount if the Net Adjustment Amount is
negative. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account or bank accounts as shall be designated by
Sellers or Purchasers, as the case may be.

  

 _ _

  

 _2.8 Prorations; Prepaid Expenses_ _._ Purchasers and Sellers shall
apportion all Periodic Taxes, rents, levies with respect to the
Purchased Assets, operating expenses, water and sewer rents, and utilities
and prepaid liabilities, deposits and assets based upon the number of days in
the applicable period elapsing before and after the Effective Time. Sellers
shall be responsible for all such costs with respect to the Purchased Assets
before and immediately prior to the Effective Time and Purchasers shall be
responsible for all such costs after the Effective Time. With respect to
royalty expenses, such amounts shall be prorated as follows: (i) for
any royalty payments measured solely on a periodic basis, such amounts shall
be prorated daily; (ii) with respect to any royalties measured by volume or
sales, such amounts shall be prorated based on the volume or sales actually
removed or sold prior to Effective Time; and (iii) for any minimum payments,
credit shall be given for any such amounts paid in advance or charged for any
amounts payable in arrears in accordance with clause (i) and clause (ii)
above. With respect to freight expenses, such amounts shall be allocated
based on shipments or carriages made as of the Effective Time. If the final
prorated amounts are not known as of the Closing Date, such amounts shall be
estimated at Closing and adjustments thereto shall be made after the Closing
at such time as they are known to the parties, including interest on any
under or over estimate at the then prevailing base rate ( _i.e._ prime rate)
of Bank of America. To the extent there are any errors in the estimation or
computation of the adjustments or apportionments made on the Closing pursuant
to the terms hereof (when compared to the actual amounts incurred or received,
as applicable), then on the date that is one hundred and twenty (120) days
after the Closing, Sellers and Purchasers shall agree on the correct
computations and shall make all necessary adjustments to the prior
computation of the adjustments and apportionments (the " _True-Up_ "). Any
payment required to be made between Sellers and Purchasers in connection with
the True-Up shall be made within ten (10) Business Days after the
determination of the True-Up.

  

 _ _

  

 _2.9 Allocation of the Purchase Price._

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
deliver to Sellers a draft schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_
") allocating the cash portion of the Purchase Price and the amount of
Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets. Upon receipt of the
Allocation Schedule, Sellers and their independent certified public
accountants shall have the right during the succeeding sixty (60) day period
to review the Allocation Schedule and to examine and review all records and
work papers and other supporting documents used to prepare such schedule.
Purchaser shall give Sellers full access at all reasonable times to the
working papers relating to the Allocation Schedule, including any
descriptions of the methodology, procedures, internal audits and analysis
undertaken in connection with the preparation of the Allocation Schedule.
Sellers shall notify Purchaser in writing, on or before the last day of the
sixty (60) day period, of any good faith objections to the Allocation
Schedule, setting forth a reasonably detailed explanation of the objections
and the dollar amount of each such objection. If Sellers do not deliver such
notice within such sixty (60) day period, the Allocation Schedule shall be
deemed to have been irrevocably accepted by Sellers.

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If Sellers object to line items set forth on the Allocation
Schedule, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
such objections within thirty (30) days of receipt by the corresponding party
of any such objections. If the parties are unable to resolve the matter
within such thirty (30) day period, solely in respect of the portions of the
Allocation to which the Sellers have an objection and which such objection is
not resolved, each party shall be entitled to use its own allocation (without
regard to the Allocation Schedule) for all purposes, including for purposes
of any Tax Returns and any forms or reports required to be filed pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code (including IRS Form 8594), or any comparable
provision of state, local or foreign law.

  



  

(c) With respect to any line items set forth on the Allocation
Schedule to which Sellers do not object or which such objection is
resolved, Sellers and Purchasers shall report the transactions contemplated
hereby on all Tax Returns (including information returns and supplements
thereto required to be filed by the parties under Section 1060 of the Code
(including IRS Form 8594)) in a manner consistent with such agreed portions
of the Allocation Schedule (the " _Agreed Allocation_ "). In the event that
the Allocation Schedule or any other allocation used by either Sellers or
Purchasers is disputed by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
the assessment, determination, collection, or other imposition of any Taxes,
the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
party hereto, and Sellers and Purchasers agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to defend any Agreed Allocation in any audit or similar
proceeding.

 _4.2 Third Party Assignments_ _._ To the extent that any of the
Leases, Assumed Contracts, Licenses or other rights or commitments of any
Seller or any of its Affiliates that this Agreement contemplates are to be

without the waiver, consent, approval or authorization of the other parties to
such Leases, Assumed Contracts, Licenses or other rights or commitments (for
purposes of this Section 4.2, " _Special Agreements and Rights_ "), then
neither this Agreement nor any agreement, document or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall constitute a transfer or assignment or an
attempted transfer or assignment of such Special Agreements and Rights if
such, waiver, consent, approval or authorization is not obtained. If such
waiver, consent, approval or authorization shall not be obtained prior to the
Closing, Sellers agree, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to agree,
to cooperate with Purchasers in any reasonable arrangement designed to
provide for the applicable Purchaser the claims, rights or benefits under any
such Special Agreements and Rights to the fullest extent not prohibited by
Applicable Law or such Special Agreements and Rights, including purchasing
under outstanding purchase orders and reselling to the applicable Purchaser,
at invoice price (without any charge for such services) or exercising
rights with respect to the Purchased Assets (whether under agreements which
provide for indemnification with parties from whom any Seller or any of its
Affiliates acquired such rights or otherwise). In such event, Sellers will,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, promptly pay, assign and
remit to the applicable Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) when received by
it under any of the Special Agreements and Rights any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder and not transferred pursuant to this Section
4.2. Furthermore, if the third party with respect to any Special Agreements
and Rights subsequently consents to the assignment of such Lease, Assumed
Contract, Permit or other right or commitment to a Purchaser, the applicable
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assign to the applicable
Purchaser, and the applicable Purchaser shall assume and agree to perform all
liabilities and obligations arising thereunder after the date of such
consent, at which time such Special Agreements and Rights shall be deemed a
Purchased Asset, without the payment of further consideration, and the
obligations so assumed thereunder shall be deemed Assumed
Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of
Sellers and Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to
complete the transfer of all Permits included in the Purchased Assets (to the
extent transferable by Applicable Law) from the applicable Seller to the
applicable Purchaser as promptly as practicable, and, in any event Purchasers
and Sellers shall complete, sign and submit, as applicable, any form(s)
required by an applicable Governmental Authority as a condition to the
transfer of any such Permits not later than ten (10) days after the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , (i) not later than February 3,
2014, Purchasers shall complete drafts of any form(s) required by an
applicable Governmental Authority as a condition to the transfer of any of
the Permits set forth on _Schedule 4.2_ and shall submit such completed draft
form(s) to Sellers for review and comment, (ii) within three (3) Business
Days after receipt of such completed draft form(s) from Purchasers, Sellers
shall provide Purchasers with any comments thereto, and (iii) within three
(3) Business Days after Purchasers and Sellers agree that such form(s) are in
final form for submission to the applicable Governmental Authority, Sellers
shall sign and submit such forms to the applicable Governmental Authority.

to deliver the same to the addressee as promptly as practicable following
receipt.

 _4.4 Assistance with Records_ _._ At the Closing, Sellers shall,

extent permitted by Applicable Law), accounting reports and records, Tax
Returns and other associated files related to Taxes, audit files and
correspondence, and litigation files and records. From time to time after the
Closing, Sellers and Purchasers shall each cause their
appropriate Representatives to provide the other party with (i) information
and data (including work papers) reasonably requested by such
requesting party in connection with its current or former operation of the
Business, including personnel and employee benefit records (to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law), or to prepare all accounting and related reports
and all Tax Returns with respect to the Business; and (ii) assistance as may
be reasonably requested by such requesting party in connection with its
current or former operation of the Business or any third party claims or
litigation (including any audit or other examination by any Taxing
authority or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to any
party\'s liability for Taxes) relating to the Business. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers\' obligation pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall be subject
at all times to (i) compliance with Applicable Laws protecting the privacy of
employees and personnel files; and (ii) appropriate limitations on the
disclosure of information to maintain the attorney-client privilege.

 _4.5 Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable data privacy rules and other Applicable
Law, Sellers have provided to Purchasers a list of employees who are
primarily engaged in the Business but not including any such employees who
provide back office support to the Business (the " _Affected Employees_ "),
with their respective employer, job title, date of hire, job grade, employment
status (full time, part-time, temporary, leave of absence or seasonal),
primary work location, base salary and bonus, and annual vacation entitlement.
Sellers may update such list prior to the Closing Date to reflect changes on
account of (i) attrition among the Affected Employees; and (ii) new hires to
replace Affected Employees terminated by any Seller in the ordinary course of
business prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall provide to Purchasers an
updated version of the list periodically as appropriate or as reasonably
requested by any Purchaser. Sellers shall provide to Purchasers a final
version of such list no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, setting forth all of the Affected Employees.

  



  

(b) _WARN Act_. With respect to the WARN Act, Purchasers and
Sellers intend that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein will not interrupt in any material respect the ongoing operation of
the Business. Sellers and their respective Affiliates (i) have provided
Purchasers a true and complete list of employees by site of employment who
have experienced an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) within
ninety (90) days prior to the date hereof, including in each case the date of
such employment loss, and (ii) will refrain from causing any Affected
Employee from suffering an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act)
from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if shorter, in
the ninety (90) days prior to the Effective Time. Purchasers will provide (or
cause their respective Affiliates to provide) a sufficient number of job
offers on sufficient terms and conditions of employment to the Affected
Employees so as not to give rise to any obligation or liability of Sellers
under the WARN Act relating to the Affected Employees and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Offer and Hiring Procedures_. From a date following the date
of this Agreement that is mutually agreeable to the parties (and which shall
be not later than thirty (30) days following the date hereof) through the
Closing Date, Sellers shall make the Affected Employees of the Business
available for employment screening by Purchasers (or their respective
Affiliates) and shall cooperate with Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates to facilitate offers of employment to some or all of the Affected
Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that in each case the date, time and
duration of such access shall be subject to Sellers\' prior approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, shall be
scheduled in such a manner so as to minimize disruption to the Business, and
shall be subject to such other procedures as shall be mutually agreeable to
the parties. Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates may rehire or
retain any Affected Employee who is not offered a position by a Purchaser or
its Affiliates or who refuses to accept a position offered by Purchaser or
its Affiliates. Purchasers shall determine which, if any, of the Affected
Employees they or their respective Affiliates wish to hire, and shall hire
such employees as of the Effective Time. Any Affected Employee who is not
offered employment by a Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Effective Time
will, for the purposes of this Section 4.5(c), be conclusively deemed to have
chosen to remain an employee of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
and will no longer have any connection with the Business. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 4.5, neither Purchasers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be obligated to continue or maintain any Benefit
Plan maintained by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates for the
benefit of its employees. Nothing in this Agreement, either expressed or
implied, shall confer upon any employee of Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period or of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _No Assumption of Employee or Related Obligations_. Neither
Purchasers nor any of their respective Affiliates will assume or
be responsible for any obligation or Liability arising out of any employment,
leased employee, independent contractor or agency relationship of any Seller
or its Affiliates (or out of termination of any such relationship). Without
limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay all
Affected Employees (i) any accrued vacation to which they are entitled; and
(ii) each eligible Affected Employee\'s bonus, to the extent earned with
respect to periods ending on or prior to 2013.

  



  

(e) _COBRA Coverage_. Sellers shall remain responsible for all
liabilities and obligations in connection with claims for post-
employment medical, vision and dental benefits that may be required under
Section 4980B of the Code made by (i) any of their employees who were not
hired by a Purchaser as provided in Section 4.5(c); or (ii) any "qualified
beneficiary" (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) of any such
employee who is receiving post-employment medical, vision and dental benefits
or whose "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code)
entitling such individuals to such benefits accrued on or before the
Effective Time.

excluding any defined benefit retirement plans) that are substantially
similar, on an aggregate basis, to the plans generally in effect for
similarly situated employees of the applicable Purchaser or such Affiliate
(other than any defined benefit retirement plans) (" _Purchaser Benefit

contained herein to the contrary, a Covered Employee whose employment is
terminated by the applicable Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates during

severance practice of Sellers as set forth on _Schedule 4.5(f)_ , subject to
the execution, delivery and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of
Sellers and Purchasers and their respective Affiliates.

  



  

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, the applicable Purchaser or
its Affiliate shall (A) provide all Covered Employees with service
credit, for all purposes, including for purposes of calculating vacation
eligibility, severance amounts and calculating eligibility,
participation, vesting and levels of benefit accruals, under any Purchaser
Benefit Plans in which Covered Employees are eligible to participate, for all
periods of employment with any Seller or Affiliates of any Seller (or their
predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time for which service was
recognized by the applicable Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_  that such service shall not be recognized for
purposes of (x) any defined benefit retirement plan, (y) retiree welfare
benefits, or (z) any Purchaser Benefit Plan that is a frozen plan; (B) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or
required physical examinations under any Purchaser Benefit Plans providing
healthcare benefits to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and
their eligible dependents to the extent waived under any similar plans of
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (C) give the Covered Employees and their eligible
dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred

immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (A) constitute or be
deemed to be an amendment to any employee benefit plan of Purchasers
and/or any of their respective Affiliates or any other compensation or
benefit plan, program or arrangement of Purchasers or any of their respective
Affiliates, or (B) limit the right of Purchasers or any of their respective
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee at any time.

  



  

(iv) The provisions of this Section 4.5 are for the sole benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any employees), other than the parties and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section
4.5(f) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement).

  



  

(v) Sellers will provide Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates)
with the opportunity to meet with the union steward at the Tampa Cement Plant
to discuss the proposed terms and conditions of employment between Purchasers
(or their respective Affiliates) and the employees currently covered by the
Tampa Plant CBA to whom Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates) (in their
discretion) may wish to extend offers of employment in accordance herewith.
Purchasers acknowledge and agree that the liability and obligation for
any liabilities, obligations or grievances arising from any agreement entered
into between Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates) and the union with
respect to such employees, if any, shall be that of the Purchasers (or their
respective Affiliates) and not the Sellers. Sellers acknowledge and agree
that Purchasers (or their respective Affiliates) shall have no liability or
obligation for any liabilities, obligations or grievances existing under the
terms of the Tampa Plant CBA as of the Effective Time or otherwise arising
from Sellers\' operation of the Business prior to the Effective Time and that
any such liabilities, obligations and grievances shall be Excluded

of any Seller or any of its Affiliates are to be transferred or assigned to a
Purchaser but are either not transferable or assignable to such Purchaser, or
cannot be purchased or assumed by such Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
without the consent of the other parties to such Assumed Contracts, Leases,
Licenses or other rights or commitments of any Seller or any of its Affiliates
that are to be transferred or assigned to such Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, Sellers will at their expense use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, all such consents of such other party to
the transfer of such Assumed Contracts, Leases, Licenses or other rights or
commitments of any Seller or any of its Affiliates to the applicable Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement (including, promptly after the date hereof,
submitting to the other parties to such Assumed Contracts, Leases, Licenses
or other rights or commitments of any Seller or any of its Affiliates that are
to be transferred or assigned to the applicable Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement documentation (in substance and form reasonably acceptable to the
applicable Purchaser) seeking the written waiver, consent, approval and
authorization of such other contracting parties to the transfer, assignment,
novation or amendment of all applicable claims, rights, benefits and
liabilities thereunder of Sellers and their respective Affiliates to the
applicable Purchaser); _provided_ , _however_ , that in any case where
required in writing by the other parties to such Assumed Contracts, Leases,
Licenses or other rights or commitments of any Seller that are to be
transferred or assigned to a Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, the
applicable Purchaser will expressly assume the future obligations of Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates under any such Assumed Contracts,
Leases, Licenses or other rights or commitments of any Seller or any of its
Affiliates that are to be transferred or assigned to such Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement to the extent that such liabilities and obligations did not
arise out of a breach of such Assumed Contracts, Leases, Licenses or other
rights or commitments of any Seller or any of its Affiliates that are to be
transferred or assigned to Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement.

 _7.6 Notice of Developments_.

  



  

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, each of
Sellers and Purchasers will give prompt written notice to the other party
of (i) any material adverse event, fact, occurrence (or failure thereof) or
development that such party becomes aware of which causes or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Article 5 and Article 6 above, as
applicable, as of the Closing Date; (ii) the occurrence of any breach of any
covenant by such Party (or such party\'s Affiliates) or the occurrence (or
failure thereof) of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions
in Article 9 or Article 10, as applicable, impossible or unlikely; (iii) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
herein contemplated; (iv) any notice or other communication received from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions herein contemplated, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
could be material to either Purchasers, Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates; and (v) any proceeding commenced or threatened against, relating
to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Affiliates
which relate to this Agreement or the transactions herein
contemplated. Except as provided in Section 7.6(b), such disclosure by any
party pursuant to this Section 7.6(a), however, shall not be deemed to amend
or supplement any schedule or cure any misrepresentation or breach of any
warranty, representation, covenant, condition or agreement or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Purchasers.

  



  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.6(a), Sellers shall
provide Purchasers with written updates to the Disclosure Schedules
promptly upon becoming aware of facts or circumstances that would cause any
of Sellers\' representations and warranties in Article 5 to be untrue or
incomplete in any material respect (a " _Disclosure Schedule Supplement_ ").
Any disclosure in such Disclosure Schedule Supplement shall not be (i) deemed
to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
Sellers contained in this Agreement; or (ii) used for purposes of determining
whether or not the conditions set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a fact or circumstance as disclosed in such
Disclosure Schedule Supplement would directly result in Purchasers having the
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1(b) prior to
Closing and Purchasers do not elect to terminate this Agreement, then
Purchasers shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to post-
Closing indemnification under Article 8 with respect only to such matter, and
only to the extent of the specific disclosure, as provided in such Disclosure
Schedule Supplement.

 _7.7 Exclusivity_ _. _ Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and the respective Representatives of Sellers and their
respective Affiliates to, immediately cease (i) any and all discussions or
negotiations with any person regarding any offer or proposal relating to any
direct or indirect business combination transaction involving the Business or
the Purchased Assets, including the merger or consolidation thereof or the
sale of all or any portion of the Business or the Purchased Assets (other than
in the ordinary course of business) or any joint venture or similar
arrangement with respect to any parts of the Business (an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "); (ii) furnishing to any Person any information with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) cooperating with, assisting in,
participating in, facilitating or encouraging an Acquisition Proposal. Until
such time, if any, as this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to Section
11.1, Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and the
respective Representatives of Sellers and their respective Affiliates not to,
(i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate or
entertain any inquiries or making an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) directly
or indirectly discuss or negotiate with, provide any information to or
consider the merits of any inquiries or proposals from any person relating to
any Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement regarding an
Acquisition Proposal.

 _7.8 Risk of Loss and Casualty_. All risk of loss with respect to
the Purchased Assets shall remain with Sellers until the Effective Time and,
assuming the occurrence of the Closing, shall pass to Purchasers immediately
following the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. If, prior to the Effective Time, any material damage to or loss of
any of the Purchased Assets occurs due to fire, flood, riot, war, terrorism,
theft, act of God or other casualty, or by reason of condemnation ("
_Casualty Event_ "), Sellers shall be required to provide Purchasers with
prompt written notice of such Casualty Event and Purchasers may elect, within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such notice, to either (i) terminate this
Agreement if such Casualty Event results in a Material Adverse Change, in
which event the parties shall have no further obligations or liabilities under
this Agreement; or (ii) to reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to
the sum of the reasonably estimated total cost necessary to repair or replace
the damage or loss plus the reasonably estimated amount of lost profits that
Purchasers will incur by reason of such damage or loss. The adjustments in
accordance with this Section 7.8 are the exclusive adjustments to the Purchase
Price to be made by reason of such occurrence for purposes of this Agreement.

  

 _ _

  

 _7.9 Transfer Taxes_. Any sales, use, transfer, real estate
transfer, vehicle transfer, stamp, conveyance, value added or other
similar Taxes that may be imposed by any Governmental Authority, and all
recording or filing fees, notarial fees and other similar costs of Closing
with respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, the assignment
of the Leases or otherwise on account of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), will be borne by
Purchasers, jointly and severally. Sellers and Purchasers shall file all
necessary Tax Returns or other documentation with respect to all such Taxes.
Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate to obtain any available exemption with
respect to such Taxes.

  

 _ _

  

 _7.10 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

  



  

(a) To the extent not already filed and unless otherwise agreed by
the parties, each of the parties hereto agree to use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) file within three (3) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, any notification and report forms and related materials that it
may be required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act; and
(ii) to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority

(b) If reasonably requested by Purchasers, and if not prohibited to
do so by the relevant Governmental Authority, the Sellers shall,
upon reasonable notice, cause an informed representative thereof to attend
any one or more meetings, either by phone or in person, with Purchasers
before a Governmental Authority in support of fulfilling the conditions to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with the parties\'
obligations under this Section 7.10, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the other parties are not prohibited by any
Governmental Authority from participating in any meetings, discussions,
negotiations, conferences or other communications with such Governmental
Authority. Subject to and without limiting the parties\' obligations under
this Section 7.10, Purchasers shall have the right to direct the strategy
regarding and make the final decision with respect to matters relating to
interactions with a Governmental Authority contemplated by this Section 7.10.

  



  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in Section 7.1 and this Section 7.10, but subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7.10(e) below, each of Purchasers and Sellers
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any and
all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert
under any Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any Antitrust
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than
the Termination Date (as defined in Section 11.1(b)), including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of one or more of
the Purchased Assets, (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
after the Closing would limit any Purchaser\'s and/or its Affiliates\' or
Subsidiaries\' freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
operate and/or retain, one or more of the Purchased Assets, and (z) agreeing
to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or a
Purchaser\'s or a Purchaser\'s Affiliates\' or Subsidiaries\' ability to
operate or retain, any of the Purchased Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any action contemplated by clauses (x), (y) and (z) is conditioned upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To assist
Purchasers in complying with their obligations set forth in this Section
7.10, Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, enter
into one or more agreements requested by Purchasers to be entered into by any
of them prior to the Closing with respect to any transaction to divest, hold
separate or otherwise take any action that limits the Sellers\' freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any of the Purchased Assets (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the consummation of
the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action
(a " _Divestiture Agreement_ ") shall be conditioned upon the Closing or
satisfaction of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing
will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action (and where Purchasers
have irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately following such
Divestiture Action).

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this Section 7.10, if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding is instituted by a Governmental Authority
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Antitrust Law, each of Purchasers and Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at least until the Termination Date. Nothing
in this Section 7.10 imposes any obligations on any party extending beyond
the Termination Date, nor does this Section affect Purchasers\' right to
terminate pursuant to Section 11.1(b)(v).

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none
of Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
agree to or proffer to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber or impair Purchasers\' or any of their respective
Affiliates\' ability to own or operate any assets of Purchasers or any of
their respective affiliates or any assets used (or held for use) in
connection with the production and distribution of Cement Products.

  

 _ _

  

 _7.11 Press Releases_. Prior to the Closing, no party shall issue any
press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions herein contemplated without the prior written consent of the
other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit
any party or its Affiliates from issuing or causing publication of any such
press release or public announcement to the extent that such party determines
such action to be required in connection with any filing with a
Governmental Authority or otherwise required by Applicable Law applicable to
it or its Affiliates, in which event the party making such
determination shall, if practicable in the circumstances, use reasonable
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of its issuance.

such covenant and agreement shall survive the Closing and operative and in
full force and effect for such specified term. Notwithstanding the preceding
two sentences, if notice of a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall have been given by the party seeking to be indemnified prior
to the date on which such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Section 8.1 then such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (and related claims for
indemnification) shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate

 _8.2 Indemnity by Sellers_ _._ Sellers agree to jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchasers and their
respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns (the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ "), from and against any Loss suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnitees arising out of, in connection with, relating to, or
resulting from:

  



  

(a) any breach of or failure to comply with any covenant or
agreement made by a Seller in this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any inaccuracy in, misrepresentation, or breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by a Seller in this Agreement or in any
schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (other than with respect to the breach or inaccuracy of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.12 (Environmental), the
indemnity for which shall be governed by Section 8.2(d) below);

  



  

(c) the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities (including in
each case the Identified Matters (up to the Identified Matters Cap), the
Ongoing Remedial Actions, Environmental Conditions of the Excluded Real
Property and the Off-Site Environmental Liabilities);

  



  

(d) (i) any inaccuracy in, misrepresentation, or breach of any of
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.12
(Environmental) or in any schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered or to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) any Environmental Condition, even
if not discovered until after the Closing (other than the Ongoing Remedial
Actions, the Identified Matters and Environmental Conditions of the Excluded
Real Property) found to exist for which Remedial Action is required in writing
by any Governmental Authority; or (iii) any violation of any Environmental
Law prior to the Effective Time that relates to the Real Property, the
Excluded Real Property or the Business. Such Losses or claims, may sometimes
be referred to herein as " _Seller Environmental Liabilities_ " and any claim
made pursuant to this Agreement by Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such
Seller Environmental Liabilities is an " _Environmental Indemnification
Claim_ ;" and

  



    

47

--- 

    



  

(e) the employee and related liabilities set forth in Section
4.5(d).

  



  

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the indemnity
provided in paragraph (d) above shall terminate and be of no further force
and effect after the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, except that
any matters with respect to which notice of a claim for indemnification has
been provided to Sellers on or prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Sellers\' indemnification obligation hereunder shall survive
until such claim is finally resolved.

  

 _ _

  

 _8.3 Indemnity by Purchasers_ _._ Purchasers agree to jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates, Representatives, successors and assigns (the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ "), from and against any Loss suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees arising out of, in connection with, relating to, or resulting
from:

  



  

(a) any breach of or failure to comply with any covenant or
agreement made by a Purchaser in this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any inaccuracy in, misrepresentation, or breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by a Purchaser in this Agreement or in any
schedule, exhibit or certificate delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement; and

  



  

(c) the operation of the Business following the Effective Time, the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.

  

 _ _

  

 _8.4 Claims Procedure_.

  



  

(a) _Notice. _ A party seeking indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall, promptly after becoming aware of any
fact, condition or event that may give rise to Losses for which
indemnification may be sought under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as
applicable, notify the party providing indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _Indemnitor_ ") in writing (" _Claim Notice_ ") of the facts
that are the basis of such Loss which the Indemnitee has determined has given
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (" _Claim_ ");
_provided_ that any delay in providing such Claim Notice shall not relieve
the Indemnitor of any indemnification responsibility under this Article 8
except to the extent, if any, that such delay materially prejudices the
ability of the Indemnitor to defend against Losses in connection with Third
Party Claims.

  



  

(b) _Third Party Claims._ If any Claim relates to the assertion of
any claim, the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, the
imposition of any penalty or assessment, or demand by a third party against
any Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee (" _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnitor will have thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice to
elect to defend the Indemnitee against the Third Party Claim with counsel of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee at the Indemnitor\'s
expense so long as:

  



    

48 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and does not
seek an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnitor acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnitee under this Agreement with respect to the Thirty Party Claim;

  



  

(iii) the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim in
good faith, actively and diligently; and

  



  

(iv) the Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnitee promptly and reasonably
informed of all information and communications related to the Third Party
Claim.

  



  

(c) So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b):

  



  

(i) the Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost
and expense ( _provided_ that the Indemnitor shall pay such costs and
expenses if the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and the
Indemnitee shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to the Indemnitee which are not available to
the Indemnitor, or available to the Indemnitor the assertion of which would be
adverse to or in conflict with the interests of the Indemnitee) and the
Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnitee and its separate co-counsel to
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim; and

  



  

(ii) no Indemnitor will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee, and no Indemnitee will consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor.

  



  

(d) However, if the Indemnitor does not undertake the defense of a
Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.4(b), the Indemnitor elects to
undertake such defense, but fails to defend such Third Party Claim in good
faith, actively and diligently, or the Indemnitee has been advised in writing
by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee:

  



    

49 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) the Indemnitee shall keep the Indemnitor promptly and reasonably
informed of all information and communications related to the Third Party
Claim;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnitee may defend against, and consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the Third Party
Claim (but shall not have waived any right to indemnification therefor
hereunder) in any manner it reasonably and in good faith may deem appropriate
(and the Indemnitee need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, any
Indemnitor in connection therewith) with counsel of its choosing at the cost
and expense of the Indemnitor; and

  



  

(iii) the Indemnitor will remain responsible for any Loss the
Indemnitee may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the
nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the extent provided in this
Article 8.

  



  

(e) _Other Claims._ For all other Claims other than a Third Party
Claim, if the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing that it does not
dispute such Claim or fails to notify the Indemnitee in writing within thirty
(30) days following receipt of the Claim Notice that it disputes such Claim,
the Losses identified in the Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a Loss
of the indemnified parties under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, as applicable,
and the Indemnitor shall promptly pay the Indemnitee in immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Indemnitee the
amount of such Loss.

  



  

(f) _General. _ The Indemnitor and the Indemnitee agree to
negotiate in good faith to attempt to reach a resolution of any disputed Claim
in order to attempt to avoid resorting to dispute resolution or a court of
competent jurisdiction for such resolution.

  



  

(g) Environmental Indemnification Claims.

  



  

(i) In addition to the preceding provisions of this Section 8.4
(other than Section 8.4(f), which this Section 8.4(g) shall supersede), the
following provisions shall apply in connection with any Environmental
Indemnification Claim or Excluded Liability that requires Remedial Action:

  



  

(1) Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to control
such Remedial Action. Where a Seller has failed to exercise its right to
control a Remedial Action in a reasonably timely and diligent manner, any
Purchaser shall be entitled to serve notice of such failure on Sellers and to
assume control of such Remedial Action if Sellers have not cured the matters
set forth in such notice in a prompt manner (and in no event less than thirty
(30) days after the date of such notice). For the avoidance of doubt,
Purchasers\' assumption of control of a Remedial Action shall not limit or
otherwise affect Sellers\' obligation or liability hereunder with respect to
such matter.

  



    

50 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(2) The party that assumes control of a Remedial Action hereunder
(the " _Controlling Party_ ") will cause to be developed a plan of
remediation (a " _Remediation Plan_ "). The Remediation Plan shall provide for
Remedial Action in a manner consistent with applicable Environmental Laws,
including all guidelines and standards established by each Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction with respect to the subject matter of the
Remedial Action. The Remediation Plan and the implementation of the Remedial
Action will minimize to the greatest extent practicable any disruption to the
operations at the affected facility. Without limiting the foregoing, but
subject to the provisions of this Clause (2) and Clause (3) below, the
Remediation Plan shall not include the use of any deed restrictions or other
institutional or engineering controls without the written approval of
Purchasers (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
denied). With respect to the Ongoing Remedial Actions, the Identified
Matters and Environmental Conditions of the Excluded Real Property, the
obligations of Sellers shall be based on reasonably cost-effective response
actions that achieve Remediation Standards that are consistent with the
current industrial use of the applicable Real Property and Excluded Real
Property, that do not interfere with or limit Purchasers\' operations
(including reasonably anticipated future operations on the applicable Real
Property, such as expansion of the existing business operations), and that
satisfy the requirements of applicable Governmental Authorities and
Environmental Laws (" _Reasonably Cost-Effective Response Actions_
"). Sellers shall be responsible for obtaining (with cooperation from
Purchasers) any permits required by a Governmental Authority in connection
with performance of the Ongoing Remedial Actions. Sellers shall not be
obligated for any additional costs or expenses with respect to the Ongoing
Remedial Actions or the Identified Matters to the extent that such additional
costs or expenses result from a modification in the use of such Real Property
or Excluded Real Property such that the Real Property or Excluded Real
Property is no longer primarily used for industrial purposes.

  



  

(3) In the event that, under applicable Environmental Laws, the
Remediation Plan must be approved by any Governmental Authority,
Controlling Party shall not submit the Remediation Plan to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities without first providing the other party (the " _Non-
Controlling Party_ ") with a reasonable opportunity to review, comment and
approve the Remediation Plan (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or denied). If the parties cannot agree on the Remediation Plan, then
either party may invoke dispute resolution pursuant to Section 8.4(h). Upon
receipt by Controlling Party of all approvals required by the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, Controlling Party may implement the Remediation
Plan.

  



    

51 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(4) In the event that, under applicable Environmental Laws, approval
of the Remediation Plan is not required from any Governmental
Authority, then, Controlling Party will, with reasonable promptness in light
of the nature of the matter requiring Remedial Action, cause its
environmental consulting firm to prepare a proposed Remediation Plan and will
submit the proposed Remediation Plan to Non-Controlling Party. The proposed
Remediation Plan will be final only when it has been approved in writing by
both Controlling Party and Non-Controlling Party (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied) or is established pursuant to the
dispute resolution procedure described in Section 8.4(h). If Controlling
Party and Non-Controlling Party have not approved a Remediation Plan in
writing within sixty (60) days after initial submission to the Non-
Controlling Party, Controlling Party and Non-Controlling Party will
continue efforts to develop a mutually acceptable Remediation Plan, but
either Controlling Party or Non-Controlling Party will also have the right to
initiate the dispute resolution procedure in Section 8.4(h) in order to
resolve any disagreement or dispute regarding the proposed Remediation Plan.

  



  

(5) Whenever a Remediation Plan is approved in accordance with clause
(3) or clause (4), above, Controlling Party shall promptly implement
the Remediation Plan, complete the Remedial Action called for in such plan
and seek any required determination from each Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction or, if no such determination is required, the written
certification of Controlling Party\'s environmental engineering consulting
firm, and, if Non-Controlling Party so chooses, Non-Controlling Party\'s
environmental engineering consulting firm, that no further Remedial Action is
required with respect to the matter. Upon receipt of all such determinations
or certifications, the Sellers shall have no further liability or obligation
to the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to the subject of such
Remedial Action.

  



  

(6) Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.4(g), the Purchasers
and their respective Affiliates shall, upon receipt of reasonable
prior notice by Seller, grant Sellers and their respective agents and
representatives access as is reasonably required to the applicable Real
Property and Excluded Real Property for Sellers to complete any required
Remedial Actions; _provided_ that Sellers\' access to such Real Property or
Excluded Real Property and implementation of the Remedial Action shall

any Purchaser, with the specific intent to deceive and mislead any Purchaser,
regarding the representations and warranties made herein or in any schedule,
exhibit or certificate delivered pursuant hereto.
