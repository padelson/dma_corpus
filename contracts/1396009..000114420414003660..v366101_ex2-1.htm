agree, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to agree, to cooperate with Purchasers in any reasonable arrangement designed
to provide for the applicable Purchaser the claims, rights or benefits under any such Special Agreements and Rights to the fullest

orders and reselling to the applicable Purchaser, at invoice price (without any charge for such services) or exercising rights

Special Agreements and Rights any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder and not transferred pursuant to this Section 4.2.
Furthermore, if the third party with respect to any Special Agreements and Rights subsequently consents to the assignment of such
Lease, Assumed Contract, Permit or other right or commitment to a Purchaser, the applicable Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, assign to the applicable Purchaser, and the applicable Purchaser shall assume and agree to perform all liabilities and obligations
arising thereunder after the date of such consent, at which time such Special Agreements and Rights shall be deemed a Purchased
Asset, without the payment of further consideration, and the obligations so assumed thereunder shall be deemed Assumed Liabilities.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Sellers and Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to complete
the transfer of all Permits included in the Purchased Assets (to the extent transferable by Applicable Law) from the applicable
Seller to the applicable Purchaser as promptly as practicable, and, in any event Purchasers and Sellers shall complete, sign and
