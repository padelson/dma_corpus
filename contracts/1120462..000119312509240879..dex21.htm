Company shall thereupon cease, (b) Merger Sub shall be the surviving

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by Law) of those conditions),
or (b) at such other place, time and date as Parent and the Company may agree.
The date on which the Closing takes place is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

1.4 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the appropriate parties hereto
shall execute in the manner required by the IBCA and the DGCL and file with
the Iowa Secretary of State and the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware appropriate articles or certificates of merger relating to the
Merger (collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ "), and the parties hereto
shall take such other and further actions as may be required by Law to make

accordance with the DGCL and the provisions of such Certificate of
Incorporation.

2.2 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the

ARTICLE III.

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OR CANCELLATION OF SHARES IN

THE MERGER 

3.1 _Share Consideration for the Merger; Conversion or Cancellation of Shares
in the Merger_.

(a) _Merger Consideration_.

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
holders of any shares of Company Capital Stock or the holders of any capital
stock of Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Shares (as defined in Section 3.1(b)) shall, by virtue of
the Merger, be converted into the right to receive, pursuant to Section 3.2,
upon the surrender of the certificates evidencing the Company Common Stock (or
evidence of shares in book entry form), the Parent Stock Consideration and the
Cash Consideration (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest thereon, and shall be automatically cancelled and extinguished, in
accordance with Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
Section 6.1(c), if prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, and, in each such case, the record date for such
transaction is between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, then
any number or amount contained herein that is based upon the number of shares
of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. As provided in Section 3.4, the right of any holder of Company Common
Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
the amount of any withholding under applicable tax Law.

(ii) _Definitions_. For purposes hereof, the following terms have the
following respective meanings:

" _Cash Consideration_ " means an amount per share of Company Common Stock in
cash equal to $7.90.



 

3 " _Conversion Ratio_ " means 0.804.

" _Parent Stock Consideration_ " means that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock payable in the Merger for each share of Company Common Stock at a rate
of one share of Company Common Stock multiplied by the Conversion Ratio.

(iii)  _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued in connection with the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of any
fractional share to which it would otherwise be entitled (taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder), each former
holder of Company Common Stock shall receive in cash an amount equal to the
fair market value of its fractional interest, which fair market value shall be
determined by multiplying such fraction by the sum of (A) the Cash
Consideration and (B) the product of (I) the Conversion Ratio and (II) the
Closing Market Price (as defined below) (the " _Per Share Amount_ "). The "
_Closing Market Price_ " shall be the average of the per share closing prices
for Parent Common Stock, calculated to two decimal places, for the ten (10)
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date that is two (2)
Business Days before the Effective Time, as reported on the NYSE.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding and owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of
Parent, or held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding, and shall be
automatically cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of Merger Sub Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and remain one
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

3.2 _Exchange of Stock Certificates_. Certificates (or evidence of shares in
book entry form) for shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for
certificates (or evidence of shares in book entry form) evidencing the Parent
Stock Consideration and for the Cash Consideration in accordance with the
following procedures: 

(a) Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as exchange agent under this Agreement (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and who
shall serve pursuant to an agreement between Parent and the Exchange Agent
(the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates (or evidence of shares in
book entry form) representing, as nearly as practicable, the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock into which all shares of Company Common Stock are to
be converted in the Merger, (ii) an amount in cash equal to the Cash
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be
converted in the Merger, and (iii) unless the Company has already paid such
amount to its transfer agent for distribution to shareholders, an amount equal
to any Final Quarterly Dividend and/or any Final Interim Dividend for which
Parent is responsible under Section 6.10.



 

4 (b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a
form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
(including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents
message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may
specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval), together with
instructions thereto. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive (and
the Exchange Agent shall deliver) (A) certificates (or electronic
equivalents) representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock into
which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been converted in the
Merger, and (B) a bank check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted
_plus_ any cash due in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
3.1(a)(iii).

(c) No dividends or distributions that have been declared, if any, with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to Persons entitled to receive certificates (or electronic
equivalents) for shares of Parent Common Stock until such Persons surrender
their certificates (or electronic equivalents) for Company Common Stock in
accordance with the procedure described in Section 3.2(b), at which time all
such dividends and distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid. In no event shall the Persons entitled to receive such
dividends be entitled to receive interest on such dividends.

(d) In no event shall the holder of any surrendered certificates (or evidence
of shares in book entry form) be entitled to receive interest on any of the
Cash Consideration to be received in the Merger.

(e) If any certificate (or electronic equivalents) for such Parent Common
Stock or check for the Cash Consideration is to be issued in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the certificates (or electronic
equivalents) surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a
condition of the exchange that the certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of issuance of such check to a Person other
than the registered holder of the certificates (or electronic equivalents)
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(f) Any funds deposited with the Exchange Agent (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company
Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article 



 

5  III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article III,
in each case without any interest thereon.

(g) If any certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange
Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such certificate, Parent shall direct the
Exchange Agent to issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such certificate, as
contemplated by this Article III.

(h) None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case, delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions remaining unclaimed as of a date
which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interests of any person previously entitled
thereto.

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any of the funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Parent. 

(j) Except for (i) the right to surrender of the certificate(s) (or evidence
of shares in book entry form) representing the Company Common Stock in
exchange for the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the right to receive the dividends as
required by Section 6.10, at and after the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time and each holder
of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of
the Company, and no transfer of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.

3.3 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall adopt such
resolutions or shall take such other actions as are required to effect the
measures contemplated by this Section 3.3.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company Common Stock (a
" _Company Option_ ") that has been granted under the Companys 2002 Stock
Incentive Plan (the " _2002 Plan_ ") and is outstanding at the Effective Time,
whether or not then exercisable, 



 

6  will be cancelled and exchanged for, and the holder of each such Company
Option will be entitled to receive, upon surrender of the Company Option, for
each share of Company Common Stock purchasable thereunder, the Parent Stock
Consideration (provided, that any resulting fractional shares shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole number) plus cash equal to the Cash Consideration,
_less_ the exercise price per share of such Company Option (the " _Net Cash
Payment_ "). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deduct and
withhold from the Net Cash Payment such amounts as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation reasonably and in good faith determine are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the Company Option, including, but not
limited to, Social Security, Medicare, federal or state income tax, or any
other taxes required to be withheld pursuant to federal, state, local or
foreign tax Law (the " _Withholding Taxes_ "). If the Net Cash Payment is
insufficient to cover the Withholding Taxes, the Surviving Corporation shall
withhold shares of Parent Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the
amount of such remaining Withholding Taxes. For purposes of this Section
3.3(b), "fair market value" shall be determined in accordance with Section
2.20 of the 2002 Plan. To the extent that amounts or shares are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts or withheld shares shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of a Company Option in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation. 

(c) As of the Effective Time, the 2002 Plan shall be terminated and cancelled
(without any liability on the part of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
other than as expressly set forth in this Section 3.3).

(d) Each share of restricted stock (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ")
outstanding under the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _2005 Plan_
") shall be treated the same as all other outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and shall be subject to the notice, exchange and other provisions of
this Article III, and, in accordance therewith, shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock Merger
Consideration_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the 2005 Plan or the agreement granting such
Company Restricted Stock, the Cash Consideration portion of the Restricted
Stock Merger Consideration and the Parent Stock Consideration portion of the
Restricted Stock Merger Consideration shall be subject to the same vesting
schedule, forfeiture provisions and other terms and conditions, with
appropriate adjustments for performance-based conditions, if any, as
set forth in the 2005 Plan or the agreement granting such Company Restricted
Stock, including accelerated vesting in the event of termination of employment
without cause or for good reason (as such terms are defined in the 2005 Plan
or such agreement) within the period after the Effective Time specified in
the 2005 Plan or such agreement, and the holders of Company Restricted Stock
will not receive any Cash Consideration or Parent Stock Consideration except
in accordance with such terms and conditions (and shall receive the Cash
Consideration portion of the Restricted Stock Merger Consideration, without
interest and net of withholding in accordance with Section 3.4, only once
vested in accordance with such terms and conditions). 

(e) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Restricted Stock Awards and the 2005 Plan pursuant to this Section
3.3, including the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3.
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a 



 

7  registration statement on an appropriate form with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock promptly following the Effective Time and shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such awards remain outstanding.

3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to
the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent

with respect to each other warranty or representation to which it is readily
apparent on its face that the exception, qualification or supplemental

its material properties and to carry on its business in substantially the
manner as it is now being conducted. The Company has previously made

_ERISA_ ")), any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) and Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA), and any stock purchase, stock option, severance,
employment, change in control, fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus,
incentive, or deferred compensation arrangement (collectively, the " _Company
Benefit Plans_ "). The Company has made available to Parent a true and
complete copy of the following documents, if applicable, with respect to
each Company Benefit Plan: (i) all documents setting forth the terms of the
Company Benefit Plan, or if there are no such documents evidencing the Company
Benefit Plan, a full description of the Company Benefit Plan, (ii) the ERISA
summary plan description and any other written summary of plan provisions
provided to participants or beneficiaries for each such Company Benefit Plan,
(iii) the annual report (Form 5500 series), required under ERISA or the Code,
filed for the most recent plan year and most recent financial statements or
periodic accounting of related plan assets with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan, and (iv) the most recent favorable 



 

17  determination letter, opinion, or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
for each Company Benefit Plan, the assets of which are held in trust, to the
effect that such trust is exempt from federal income tax.

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan has at all times been maintained, by its terms
and in operation in all material respects, in accordance with the Code,
ERISA, and other applicable Law. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and any related trust that is
intended to be tax-exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
that such plan is qualified under the Code and such trust is tax-exempt, and
any such determination letter remains in effect and has not been revoked. The
Company is not aware of any reason why any such determination should be
revoked or not reissued. All contributions required to be made prior to the
Closing under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan, the Code, ERISA, or
other applicable Law have been or will be timely made, and all material
liabilities with respect to any accrued benefits are reflected on the Company
Balance Sheet.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, each Company Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated at any time
without any obligation or liability other than for benefits accrued prior to
such amendment or termination, or as required to be vested pursuant to
applicable Law as a result of such amendment or termination. There are
no actions, audits, suits, or claims which are pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company threatened, against any Company Benefit Plan, except claims for
benefits made in the ordinary course of the operation of such plans that, if
adversely determined, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
material liability, tax, or penalty whatsoever to any Person whomsoever as a
result of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries engaging in a prohibited
transaction under ERISA or the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event
has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company or any
Company ERISA Affiliate to any material liability, tax, or penalty imposed by
ERISA, the Code, or other applicable Law.

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate maintains, nor has
at any time established or maintained, nor has at any time been obligated to
make, or made, contributions to or under any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
(a " _Title IV Plan_ "). No "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in
Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any Title IV Plan
or Company Benefit Plan subject to such Section 412, whether or not waived. No
"reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA, and no event
described in Sections 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has occurred in connection with
any Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate
thereof has (i) engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an
entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in Sections 4069 or
4212(c) of ERISA or (ii) incurred, or reasonably expects to incur prior to the
Effective Time (A) any liability under Title IV of ERISA arising in connection
with the termination of, or a complete or partial withdrawal from, any Title
IV Plan or (B) any liability under Section 4971 of the Code that in either
case could become a liability of Parent or any of its Affiliates after the
Effective Time. None of the Company or any of the Company ERISA Affiliates
make contributions or has any obligation to make contributions to any
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).



 

18 (e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee or director of the Company or any its Subsidiaries
to severance pay or compensation payments or any other benefits or rights,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable
Law, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount
of compensation or benefits due any such employee or director, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement. Except as set forth in _Section
4.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no contract, agreement,
plan or arrangement with any current or former employee or director of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party that, individually or collectively and as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) would reasonably be expected to give rise to
the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections
280G of the Code.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no Company Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without
limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to
current or former employees or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries
beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage mandated solely by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits or retirement
benefits under any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(2)
of ERISA), (iii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets included in the Company SEC Reports, or (iv)
benefits the full costs of which are borne by the current or former employee
or director or his or her beneficiary.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has used the services of
workers provided by third party contract labor suppliers, temporary
employees, "leased employees" (within the meaning of Section 414(n) of the
Code) or individuals who have provided services as independent contractors to
an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the disqualification
of any Company Benefit Plan or the imposition of penalties or excise taxes
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan by the Internal Revenue Service, the
Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity.

(h) All outstanding Company Options were issued and fully vested prior to
December 31, 2004.

Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any

Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would materially interfere with the
respective business activities of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

any contract relating to any transaction, arrangement or relationship between
or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity, on the other hand) where the purpose or intended
effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving the Company in the Companys consolidated financial statements.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure

4.17  _Permits_.

(a) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold all
material permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations,
certificates and approvals of all Governmental Entities that are required from
them to own, lease or operate their assets and to carry on their businesses
(the " _Company Permits_ "). Except as set forth in _Section_  



 

25   _4.17_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) the Merger, in and of itself,
would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any Company Permit, and (ii)
since January 1, 2007, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any Governmental Entity that it is in violation
of any of the Company Permits.

(b) Each Company Permit is valid and in full force and effect and has not been
suspended, revoked, canceled or adversely modified, except where the failure
to be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation, cancellation
or modification of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Permit is subject to (i) any
conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally upon licenses
for the same classification of service issued to similarly situated providers
as the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless such conditions or requirements
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) any pending
regulatory proceeding or judicial review before a Governmental Entity, unless
such pending regulatory proceeding or judicial review has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no event,
condition or circumstance has occurred that would preclude any Company Permit
from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent that such Company
Permit is renewable by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The licensee of each Company Permit is in compliance with each Company
Permit and has fulfilled and performed all of its obligations with respect
thereto, including all reports, notifications and applications required by the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ ") or the
rules, regulations and orders of the FCC or similar rules, regulations and
orders of the IUB, the MPUC, the MPSC and the NPSC, and the payment of all
regulatory fees and contributions, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or
similar concessions or allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in
compliance, fulfill or perform its obligations or pay such fees or
contributions has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) _Section 4.17(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
all Company Permits (including, without limitation, wireless spectrums),
together with the name of the entity holding such Company Permits and the
record owner of its capital stock. Except as set forth in  _Section 4.17(d)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity and controls one
hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and decision-making authority of
each licensee of the Company Permits and each owner of the wireless spectrums,
except where the failure to own such equity or control such voting power and
decision making authority of such licensees has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Permit or order or other
agreement obtained from, issued by or reached with the IUB in connection with
any proceeding to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was a party
imposes restrictions on the ability of 



 

26  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or other
distributions to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner that
limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and cash
management alternatives of the Company on a consolidated basis in a manner
more restrictive that the limitations imposed on such payments, dividends or
other distributions under the general corporate laws of Iowa applicable to
the Company and such Subsidiaries.

4.18 _Insurance_. The Company has previously made available to Parent all
material policies of insurance maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Such policies are in full force and effect and all premiums due
with respect to such policies have either been paid or adequate provisions for
the payment by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries thereof has been made,
except for such failures to be in full force and effect or to pay such
premiums as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
believes that the amounts and scope of risks covered by such policies are
customary for companies of its size, its geographic region and in the
businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

4.19 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Except as set forth in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of
the Company (other than any Subsidiaries of the Company), on the other hand,
of the type that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

4.20 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for the fees and expenses payable to J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., which fees and expenses are reflected in its agreement
with the Company, a copy of which has previously been provided to Parent, the
Company has not employed any investment banker, broker, finder, consultant or
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that would be entitled to any investment banking, brokerage,
finders or similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.21 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the opinion of
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. dated November 23, 2009, to the effect that, as
of such date, the Merger Consideration to be received by the shareholders of
the Company pursuant to the Merger is fair to such shareholders from a
financial point of view, a copy of which has previously been provided to
Parent.

4.22 _No Rights Plan_. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill"
anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect, to which the Company is
a party or otherwise bound.

4.23 _Share Ownership_. As of the date hereof, none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (i) beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder), directly
or indirectly, any shares of Parent Capital Stock, or (ii) is party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of, shares of Parent Capital Stock.



 

27 4.24 _Takeover Provisions; Appraisal Rights_. Assuming the accuracy of
Parents and Merger Subs representations and warranties in Section 5.16
hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, no state takeover statute (including

including, without 



 

31  limitation, any financial statements or schedules included therein, as of

subject of ongoing SEC review. None of the Subsidiaries of Parent is required
to file or furnish reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. 

(b) The consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income and cash flows (including the related notes thereto) of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Reports, as of their respective dates, (i) complied
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were

consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as

adjustments), all in accordance with GAAP. Since January 1, 2007, Parent has

Subsidiaries received since January 1, 2007. Parent has implemented such
programs and taken such steps as it believes are necessary to
effect compliance with all provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act that are applicable to Parent and has not received, orally or in writing,
any notification that its independent auditor (i) believes that Parent will
not be able to complete its assessment before the reporting deadline, or, if

independent auditor to complete its assessment or (ii) will not be able to
issue unqualified attestation reports with respect thereto.

906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Parent SEC Documents. For purposes
of the preceding sentence, " _principal executive officer_ " and " _principal
financial officer_ " shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, " _extensions of credit_ " to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seek
to prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement.

(b) None of the information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing for

6.2 _No Solicitation of Transactions_

(a) The Company agrees that, as of the date of this Agreement, it has, and has
caused each officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of the Company, to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Third Party (as defined below) conducted prior to the
date hereof with respect to any Competing Transaction (as defined below). The
Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall
it authorize or permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit or initiate, encourage, or facilitate or
induce, directly or indirectly, any inquiries relating to, or the submission
of, any proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise, from any Person
other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliates thereof (a " _Third Party_ ")
to acquire beneficial ownership (as determined under Rule 13d-3 of the
Exchange Act) of all or more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, sale of shares of stock, sale of assets, tender offer, exchange
offer or similar transaction or series of related transactions, which is
structured to permit such Third Party to acquire beneficial ownership of more
than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Competing
Transaction_ "); (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Competing Transaction, or furnish to any Person any information
or data with respect to or access to the properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with a Competing Transaction, or take any
other action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction; or (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding
with respect to any Competing Transaction, approve, endorse or recommend or
resolve to approve or recommend any Competing Transaction, or enter into any
agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, if, prior to the receipt of shareholder approval of
this Agreement, the Company receives a bona fide, written proposal or offer
for a Competing Transaction (for purposes of this sentence the references to
"15%" in the definition of "Competing Transaction" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%") by a Third Party, which the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consulting the Company Boards independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) (A) is reasonably likely to result in terms
that are more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock 



 

41  than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (B) is reasonably capable of being consummated ( _provided_ , that the
Company, including the Company Board, and any of its advisors, shall be
permitted to contact such Third Party and its advisors solely for the purpose
of clarifying the proposal and any material contingencies and the capability
of consummation) (a " _Superior Competing Transaction_ "), then the Company
may, in response to an unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance
with Section 6.2(b), furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, and participate in discussions and negotiations directly or
through its representatives with, such Third Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not provide any non-public information to any
such Third Party unless the Company provides such non-public
information pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement and unless any such non-
public information is first provided to Parent. With respect to any such
nondisclosure agreement entered into after the date hereof, the terms shall be
no more favorable to the Third Party than the Confidentiality Agreement is to
Parent. The Company shall be permitted to waive the provisions of any
"standstill" agreement between the Company and a Third Party to the extent
necessary to permit such Third Party to submit a Competing Transaction that
the Company Board believes, in its good faith judgment, is reasonably likely
to result in a Superior Competing Transaction. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from (i) complying with any
applicable Law, rule or regulation, including, without limitation, Rule 14d-9
and Rule l4e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
to its shareholders required by applicable Law, rule or regulation or by the
rules and regulations of the NYSE, or (iii) otherwise making such disclosure
to the Companys shareholders or otherwise that the Company Board (after
consultation with counsel) concludes in good faith is necessary in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall advise Parent orally and in writing, promptly after
receipt thereof, of (i) any proposal for a Competing Transaction received by
any officer or director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any financial advisor, attorney or other advisor, representative or employee
of the Company, and (ii) the material terms of such Competing Transaction
(including the identity of the entity proposing the Competing Transaction),
and provide a copy of such proposal for a Competing Transaction to Parent if
such proposal is in writing. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status of, and any material changes to, the terms of any such
Competing Transaction proposal and all discussions and negotiations with
respect thereto in a timely manner.

(c) In the event that prior to receipt of shareholder approval of this
Agreement, the Company Board determines that it has received a proposal for a
Superior Competing Transaction and determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal advisor) that taking any or all of the
following actions is necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and _provided_ , that neither the Company nor any
representative of the Company has breached any of the provisions of this
Section 6.2, the Company and the Company Board may withdraw, modify or change
the Company Boards approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the
Merger, _provided_ , that, prior to doing so, (A) the Company shall deliver
written notice to Parent (a " _Competing Transaction Notice_ ")
advising Parent that the Company and the Company Board intend to take such
action(s) and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms
and conditions of any Superior Competing Transaction that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company and the 



 

42  Company Board, (B) during the 72 hour period following delivery of the
Competing Transaction Notice to Parent (the " _Notice Period_ "), the Company
shall, and shall direct its financial advisors and outside legal advisors to,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that, if applicable, such Competing Transaction ceases to
constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors), a Superior Competing
Transaction, and (C) the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect
to the proposals made by Parent, if any, that such Competing Transaction
continues to constitute a Superior Competing Transaction; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, (1) if during the Notice Period described in clause (B) of
this paragraph any revisions are made to the Competing Transaction and the
Company Board in its good faith judgment determines (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal advisors) that such revisions are
material (it being understood that any change in the purchase price or form of
consideration in such Competing Transaction shall be deemed a material
revision), the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.2(c) with respect to such new
written notice and (2) in the event the Company Board does not make the
determination referred to in clause (C) of this paragraph but thereafter
determines to make change its recommendation pursuant to this Section 6.2(c),
the procedures referred to in clauses (A), (B) and (C) above shall apply anew
and shall also apply to any subsequent withdrawal, amendment or change

(d) Notwithstanding any change by the Company Board of its recommendation, the
Company shall cause the approval and adoption of this Agreement to be
submitted to a vote of the Companys shareholders at the Shareholders Meeting.

6.3  _Shareholders Meeting; Proxy Statement; Registration Statement_.

(a) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall:

(i) (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly, and in any event
within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement, prepare (with
the assistance of Parent and its representatives) and file with the SEC a
proxy statement for the purposes of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (B) obtain and furnish the information
required to be included by it in the Proxy Statement and, after consultation
with Parent and Merger Sub, respond promptly to any comments made by the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and any preliminary version thereof, and
(C) undertake to obtain the necessary approvals by its shareholders of this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

(ii) include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board
that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may withdraw, modify
or change its recommendation in accordance with Section 6.2(c), in which case
any such withdrawal, modification or change shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement; and



 

43 (iii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of
its shareholders for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this
Agreement (the " _Shareholders Meeting_ "), to be held as soon as practicable
following filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC and the completion of
the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, and in any event within forty-five
(45) days after the Registration Statement is declared effective, and the
Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Shareholders Meeting if there are
sufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Shareholders Meeting and the Company believes such shares will be voted in a
number sufficient to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the
Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Shareholders Meeting
in accordance with this Section 6.3 shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior
Competing Transaction or other Competing Transaction, or by any withdrawal,
modification or change of the recommendation of the Company Board).

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall each cause their respective representatives to
fully cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement,
and shall, upon request, furnish the Company with all information concerning
it and its Affiliates as the Company may deem reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Parent
and Merger Sub shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that should be described in the
Proxy Statement or an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.

(c) At the Shareholders Meeting, Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates shall
vote all shares of Company Capital Stock, if any, owned by them in favor of
approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare
(with the assistance of the Company and its representatives) and file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 or other appropriate form under the
Securities Act (the " _Registration Statement_ ") for the purpose of
registering under the Securities Act the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to shareholders of the Company under the provisions of this Agreement,
and obtain and furnish the information required to be included by it in the
Registration Statement and, after consultation with the Company, respond
promptly to any comments made by the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement.

(e) The Company shall cause its representatives to fully cooperate with Parent
in the preparation of the Registration Statement, and shall, upon request,
furnish Parent with all information concerning it and its Affiliates as Parent
may deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation
of the Registration Statement. The Company shall notify Parent as promptly
as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that should
be described in the Registration Statement or an amendment or supplement to
the Registration Statement.

(f) Except as may be required by Law, no amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by Parent or the Company
without 



 

44  the approval of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Parent and the Company each will advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon or requests for additional
information by the SEC.

(g) To the extent permitted or required under applicable Law, the Proxy
Statement and the Registration Statement shall be filed with the SEC and
mailed to the Companys shareholders together or concurrently.

(h) Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the NYSE a listing
application covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval for the

and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent with respect to such
listing.

hereto shall cooperate with the other and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner possible, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to (x) obtain all necessary or appropriate
waivers, consents and approvals; _provided_ , that neither the Company
nor Parent shall have any obligation hereunder to pay any amounts to third
parties in consideration of any such waivers, consents or approvals (other
than filing, recordation or similar fees payable to any Governmental Entity
and related legal fees), (y) effect all necessary registrations, filings and
submissions (including, but not limited to, (i) filings under the HSR Act and
any other information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act by the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice, (ii)

shall be, to the extent possible or required, joint filings of Parent and the
Company, (iii) the other filings referred to in Sections 4.4(a)(ii) and
5.4(b), (iv) filing of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement, and
(v) such filings, consents, approvals, orders registrations and declarations
as may be required under the Laws of any foreign country in which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries conducts any business or owns any assets), and (z)
lift any injunction or other legal bar to the Merger (and, in such case, to
proceed with the Merger as expeditiously as possible), subject, however, to
the requisite approval of the shareholders of the Company. In furtherance of
the foregoing, (i) Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to make the required filings with the FCC, IUB, MPUC,
MPSC and NPSC by December 18, 2009, (ii) filings under the HSR Act shall be
made by December 31, 2009, and (iii) the required filings with the FCC, IUB,

registration, filing or submission.



 

45 (b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to (i) use commercially reasonable
efforts to have, as promptly as practicable, the Proxy Statement cleared by

effective by the SEC under the Securities Act; and (ii) take all such
commercially reasonable actions as shall be required under applicable state
blue sky or securities Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

after the Effective Time of the Merger.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other reasonably informed of
the status of their respective efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by furnishing the other with such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as it may reasonably request in

information to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent may, as
it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.4(d) as "outside
counsel only" and, in such event, such material and the information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and

permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its
legal counsel.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take
any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate any impediments that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable
the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including,
without limitation, proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries as may be required in order to avoid the entry, or to effect the
dissolution, of any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing,
delaying or restricting the consummation of the Merger or any transactions
contemplated in this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent will not be required
to agree to any term, condition or restriction in order to obtain any such
authorizations, consents, orders or approvals if such term, condition or
restriction or amendment would (1) have or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(2) prevent Parent from consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the material terms set forth in this Agreement, or (3) that
would constitute a breach of or default under any credit agreement to which
Parent is a party in connection with its outstanding Indebtedness.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, if any Governmental Entity that has the
authority to enforce any antitrust Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to seek,
a preliminary injunction or restraining order to enjoin consummation of the
Merger, none of the parties hereto shall be required to take or agree to take
any action which such party reasonably believes would be prohibited or
restricted under such preliminary injunction or restraining order.



 

46 (g) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall form a wholly-owned Subsidiary and
shall assign or transfer to such Subsidiary, in such manner as shall be
approved by Parent, each Company Permit issued by the FCC in relation to any

pledged under any credit facility that is repaid in connection with the
Closing.

what terms and conditions, to apply for and/or accept available government

pending applications under the RUS Broadband Initiatives Program and the NTIA

6.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives of Parent (" _Parent Representatives_ "), in
order to evaluate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees,
accountants, consultants, representatives, plants, properties, contracts,
books and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) furnish or make available reasonably promptly to such
Parent Representatives all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested (including customer billing and other
data files for the purpose of planning for system integration and testing as
well as compensation and payroll data files for the purpose of planning for
payroll system integration and testing with respect to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries);  _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access
shall be conducted under the supervision of personnel of the Company and in a
manner that does not materially interfere with the normal operations of the
Company.

(b) The Company shall furnish to Parent (i) unaudited interim consolidated
statements of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared on a

following the end of each fiscal month, but in any event no later than thirty
(30) days following the end of such fiscal month and (ii) all statistical and
financial reports regularly provided to executive management in the ordinary
course of business (including in terms of level of information), promptly

47 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in
this Section 6.5 shall require the Company to disclose any information that,
in its sole and reasonable judgment, (i) it is not legally permitted to
disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or
binding order, (ii) the disclosure of which would jeopardize any attorney-
client or other legal privilege, or (iii) the disclosure of which would
conflict with, violate or cause a default under any existing agreement to
which it is a party.

 

(e) No information received pursuant to an investigation made under this
Section 6.5 shall be deemed to (i) qualify, modify, amend or otherwise affect

to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) amend or otherwise supplement the information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter, (iii) limit or restrict the remedies available to

conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions

(f) The Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 16, 2009 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between the Company and Parent shall
continue to apply with respect to information furnished by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Companys officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives hereunder.

(g) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall

any such public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except
(i) as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
agreement with any national securities exchange or automated quotation system,
in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such
public announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or
making any such public announcements; _provided_ , that no such consultation
shall be required to make any disclosure or otherwise take any action
expressly permitted by Section 6.2; _provided_ , _further_ , that each of
Parent and the Company may include disclosures relating to this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated herein in its periodic filings with
the SEC without seeking approval from, or consulting with, the other party so
long as such disclosures are substantially similar to the information
contained in previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the
other party), or (ii) each of Parent and the Company may make any public
statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors

48  statements are substantially similar to the information contained in
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly
by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other party).

6.7 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and payment or
reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, and all exculpations and limitations of
personal liability, related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
negotiation, execution or performance of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the persons listed on _Section 6.7(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter and the current or former directors or
officers, as the case may be (such persons, directors or officers
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation
or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification with respect to any claims asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such claim. For a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) maintain in effect
the current provisions regarding indemnification of the Indemnified Parties
contained in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or provisions no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties in comparable organizational
documents) of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including advances for reasonable fees and expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that such person
is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and, subject to
approval by the Surviving Corporation (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, suit or cause of action, whether civil,
criminal or administrative, to which such Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that such individual is
or was a director or officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer or employee of another person or (ii)
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time.

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies
of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries, or provide substitute
policies or purchase a "tail policy," in either case, of at least the
same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before 



 

49  the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to pay, with respect to such insurance policies, in respect of any
one policy year more than two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual
premium paid by the Company for such insurance under the current period ending
November 17, 2010 (as set forth on _Section 6.7(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable
to obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.7(b) it shall obtain as
much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.7, upon learning of any such claim, suit or cause of
action, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, suit or
cause of action, (arising after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties (which acceptance shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, or
between the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.7(c)
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ that the fewest
number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used,
(ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter
and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(d) This Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 6.7.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.



 

50 (f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
perform in accordance with their terms all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company, on the one hand,
and any director or officer of the Company, on the other hand, that are listed
in _Section 6.7(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

6.8 _Employee Matters_.

(a) (i) During the period commencing with the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
agree that each employee and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
is employed by the Company immediately before the Effective Time and who is
not employed pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall (A) receive a base salary
or base wage level (including commissions) and bonus opportunity, to the
extent applicable, not less favorable in the aggregate than that in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) be provided employee benefit
plans and arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to similarly situated Parent employees; _provided_ , that this
Section 6.8(a) shall not be deemed to be a guarantee of employment to any
employee or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or to impose any
obligation on the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to continue the
employment of any Person.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall establish, enter into or
honor such employment, compensation and related arrangements as described in
_Section 6.8(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent that
amounts under any such arrangement are not paid to the participants as of the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors shall
satisfy and honor each such arrangement and make such payment in accordance
with its terms as provided in Section 6.8(d).

(iii) During the period commencing with the Effective Time and ending on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
agree to provide Continuing Employees with severance as described in 
_Section 6.8(a)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(iv) The Company sponsors the Iowa Telecom Savings Plan and the Iowa Telecom
Hourly Savings Plan (the " _Qualified Plans_ "). Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all action necessary to fully
vest the account balances of all Employees under such Qualified Plans as of
the Effective Time. Additionally, the Company or Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their successors, shall take any and all actions necessary to
contribute the pro rata portion of the nonelective contribution to the
Qualified Plans. Consistent with past practice, all eligible employees will
receive a fixed profit sharing contribution equal to 3.0% of eligible
compensation (as such term is defined in the Qualified Plans) for the period
beginning with the first day of the calendar year in which Closing occurs
through the Closing Date.

(v) The Company sponsors the Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan (the "
_Deferred Compensation Plan_ "). Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
successors shall assume sponsorship of the Deferred Compensation Plan,
including, but not limited to, all liabilities, all payment obligations,
any "rabbi" trust and any administrative services agreements 



 

51  relating thereto, will not terminate or discontinue the Deferred
Compensation Plan without the express written consent of the participants, and
shall honor any and all elections made by participants under the Deferred
Compensation Plan, including, but not limited to, elections relating to the
timing of the distribution of benefits.

(vi) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time,
each Continuing Employee shall have the use of amounts, if any, in its
flexible spending account held by the Company in accordance with the terms of
such accounts and in accordance with the terms of the plan documents and
applicable governing laws.

(vii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall establish or enter into such
consulting arrangements as described in _Section 6.8(a)(vii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall recognize the service of Continuing
Employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time
as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with any qualified
retirement plan and welfare benefit plan or policy (including vacations and
severance policies) maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries that is
made available following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries for purposes of satisfying or determining any waiting period,
vesting, eligibility or benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals
thereunder); _provided_ , that nothing in this Section 6.8(b) shall create a
right for any employee or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
participate in or receive benefits under any of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries severance plans, practices and policies until Parents
obligation to honor the Companys severance and retention plans, practices and
policies pursuant to Section 6.8(a) has expired.

(c) With respect to any employee welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to use reasonable best efforts to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees and their dependents and beneficiaries
under such plan to the extent waived under the applicable corresponding
Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents and beneficiaries with
credit under such plan for any co-payments and deductibles paid under
corresponding Company Plans prior to the Effective Time in the calendar year
in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements (and any annual and lifetime
maximums).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its successors to satisfy and honor in accordance
with their terms as in effect on the date hereof, or as adopted subsequent to
the date hereof as expressly permitted by Sections 6.1 or 6.8 (including the
Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter relating thereto), each of the
employment agreements, executive termination agreements, bonus and awards
plans and programs, individual benefit arrangements and collective bargaining
agreements (the " _Employment Obligations_ ") listed on _Section 6.8(d)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as otherwise indicated in _Section
6.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor the 



 

52  Surviving Corporation or any of its successors shall modify, terminate or
otherwise change any such Employment Obligations without the express written
consent of the recipient or participant. Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and its successors shall pay when due any amount payable under such Employment
Obligations to the extent not paid by the Company prior to or as of the
Effective Time. Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger
constitutes a change in control or change of control, as the case may be, for
all purposes under the Company Benefit Plans and the Employment Obligations.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the
provisions of this Section 6.8 shall not operate to require Parent to
duplicate any payments or benefits payable pursuant to any compensation or
benefits plans, policies, programs, agreements or other arrangements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) except as set forth in Section 6.8(a) and
6.8(b), nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or otherwise
impair the Surviving Corporations ability to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan at any time without any obligation or liability; and (iii)
nothing contained in this Section 6.8, whether express or implied, shall
be deemed to create an obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
or otherwise issue equity awards to any employee or officer of the Company or
otherwise create a right for such individuals to receive equity awards from
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for Restricted Stock Merger
Consideration as expressly provided in Section 3.3(d).

(f) Following the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for all obligations under and shall comply with the provisions of
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN_ ") in
the event they effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as those terms
are defined in WARN), affecting in whole or in part any site of employment,
facility, operating unit or employee of the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof.

6.9 _Parent Board_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all actions
necessary to appoint Alan L. Wells to the Parent Board, effective as of the
Effective Time. If Alan L. Wells shall, prior to the Effective Time, be unable
or unwilling to hold such office beginning concurrently with the Effective
Time, a majority of the directors of the Company shall designate another
member of the Company Board to be appointed as a director in his or her place,
subject to the reasonable approval of the Parent Board.

6.10 _Dividend Matters_.

(a) If the Company has declared and set a record date for a regular quarterly
cash dividend payable to the Companys shareholders for the quarter ended
prior to the quarter in which the Effective Time occurs (the " _Final
Quarterly Dividend_ "), and the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment
date for the Final Quarterly Dividend, then Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will pay the Final Quarterly Dividend on behalf of the Company
following the Closing on the scheduled payment date for such dividend.

(b) Parent will promptly inform the Company if, prior to the Closing Date,
Parent changes or intends to change its practice of paying a dividend on a
calendar-quarter basis, declaring its quarterly dividend between forty-five
(45) and sixty (60) days prior to the end of the calendar quarter,
establishing the last trading day of the calendar quarter as the record date
for 



 

53  the quarterly dividend, paying the quarterly dividend on or about the 15th
day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter to which the
dividend relates, and/or paying a dividend of $0.25 per share each quarter.

(c) Throughout the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the Effective Time or the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms, the Company and Parent shall: (i) exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the record dates for their respective regular
quarterly cash dividends to correspond to the record dates for regular
quarterly cash dividends paid by the other, and (ii) exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the dates upon which their respective regular
quarterly cash dividends are paid to correspond to the days on which regular
quarterly cash dividends are payable by the other. Other than in accordance
with the preceding sentence, neither the Company nor Parent shall make any
change in the policies of the Company regarding the record date or payment
date for dividends.

6.11 _Termination of ESPP_.

(a) The Company shall not commence any new "Phases" (as defined in the ESPP)
under the ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement.

(b) As of the Effective Time, the ESPP shall terminate and all rights under
any provision of any other plan, program or arrangement of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the Capital Stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company shall be cancelled. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary in order to effectuate the provisions of
this Section 6.11(b).

6.12 _Tax Matters_. 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agree to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not
take any actions that to the Knowledge of Parent or the Knowledge of the
Company , as applicable, could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger
from qualifying, as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable efforts in
order for the Company to obtain the opinions of Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. and
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP described in Section 7.1(g). In
connection therewith, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall deliver
to Fredrikson and Byron, P.A. and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of such opinions,
containing customary factual statements, representations and covenants.

earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article VIII hereof, each of the Company and Parent shall file
in a timely manner all reports, schedules, forms and registration statements
with the SEC required to be filed by it pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder,
which filings (including all financial statements included therein) at the
time of such filing shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other
party in writing, by delivery of an updated Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, of: (i) the discovery by such
party of any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurred or existed
on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that caused or constitutes a
material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by such party in
this Agreement; (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that occurs,
arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause or
constitute a material inaccuracy in any representation or warranty made by
such party in this Agreement if: (A) such representation or warranty had been
made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event,
condition, fact or circumstance; or (B) such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement; (iii) any material breach of any covenant or obligation of such
party; and (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to make the timely satisfaction of any of the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof impossible or materially less
likely. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly advise the other party

transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
Company each shall bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement and
the Registration Statement. The fees and expenses related to any filing made
pursuant to the HSR Act or any competition, merger control, antitrust or

Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements, shall survive
beyond the earlier of (i) termination of this Agreement, or (ii) the Effective
Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and therein
that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after
the Effective Time and/or the provisions of this Article X, including without
limitation Section 6.7 and Section 6.8. Each party hereto agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub makes any other representations or
warranties, and each hereby disclaims any other representations and warranties
made by itself or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
financial and legal advisors or other representatives, with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the documents and the instruments
referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the other party or the
other partys representatives of any documentation or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing. The Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
termination of this Agreement, and the provisions of such Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to all information and material delivered by any party
hereunder.

10.3 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the applicable provisions of the
IBCA and the DGCL, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of the respective parties; _provided_ ,

Company, no amendment shall be made that changes the consideration payable in

hereunder, or which by Law requires further approval by the Companys
shareholders, without the approval of such shareholders.



 

69 10.4 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by

construed in accordance with the IBCA, this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

10.7  _Jurisdiction; Enforcement; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages,

agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County (the "
_Chancery Court_ ") or, if the Chancery Court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, in any court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Chancery Court
or, if the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
Chancery Court or, if the Chancery Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

(b) EACH OF THE COMPANY AND PARENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED
ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Agreement may not be assigned by any of the parties hereto by operation of law
or otherwise.



 

71 10.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than the
right to receive the consideration payable in the Merger pursuant to Article
III hereof, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights,
benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the provisions of Section 6.7
shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties
and (b) the Company shall have the right on behalf of its shareholders to
pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the transaction to the Companys shareholders) in the event of
Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement (whether or not the
Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Article VIII) which right is hereby
expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub. 

10.11 _Obligation of Parent_. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action and a guarantee
of the performance thereof.

10.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

10.13 _Certain Interpretations_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(a) Unless otherwise specified, all references in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed to refer to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement.

herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof.

(c) The words "include," includes" and "including," when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(d) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by legal
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.
