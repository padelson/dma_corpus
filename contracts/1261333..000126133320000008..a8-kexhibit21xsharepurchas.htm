SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as
of February 26, 2020 (the "Agreement Date"), by and among DocuSign
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"), Seal Software Group
Limited, a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (the
"Company"), DocuSign, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the parent company of
Purchaser (solely for purposes of Section 10.13) ("Parent") and Fortis
Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as the
shareholders' representative (the "Shareholders' Representative"). All
capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein shall have the
respective meanings ascribed thereto in Annex A.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Shareholders of the Company set forth on Exhibit A hereto (the
"Agreement Date Shareholders") and Apogee Noteholders set forth on Exhibit A
(the "Agreement Date Noteholders") hold Company Capital Shares and Company
Options representing approximately 80% of the share capital of the Company on
a fully diluted basis as at the Agreement Date. Concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, the Agreement Date Shareholders are each entering
into a joinder agreement with Purchaser in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
B (the "Joinder Agreement") and the Agreement Date Noteholders are each
entering into a Note Holder Joinder Agreement.

WHEREAS, Parent holds Company Capital Shares representing approximately 7% of
the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis as at the Agreement
Date. On or immediately prior to Closing, the Parent shall transfer such
Company Capital Shares to the Purchaser.

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Purchaser desires to acquire from each of the Company Shareholders,
excluding Purchaser (the "Selling Shareholders"), all of the Company Capital
Shares held by such Selling Shareholders immediately prior to the Closing (the
"Acquisition").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has
authorized the Company to enter into and perform this Agreement, the
Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Transactions").

WHEREAS, the Company has obtained all requisite corporate consents required to
effect the Acquisition, including where applicable the sufficient consent of a
majority of the Company Shareholders to effect the drag provisions in the
Articles.

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Purchaser has made the determinations that
are necessary under Delaware Law and Purchaser's organizational documents in
order for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and complete the Acquisition
and the Transactions.

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to purchase the entire issued share capital of the
Company not already owned by it or its Affiliates upon the Closing. The
Agreement Date Shareholders hold "drag along" rights under the Articles, which
permit such Agreement Date Shareholders to compel all Company Shareholders,
and all Company Option Holders following the exercise of their Company
Options, if applicable, to sell all of the Company Capital Shares held by them
to Purchaser upon the terms described in the Articles (the "Drag Along
Right"), and such Agreement Date Shareholders shall exercise the Drag Along
Right in connection with the Acquisition, to the extent required.

WHEREAS, in addition to the Agreement Date Shareholders who have executed and
delivered Joinder Agreements, the Selling Shareholders other than the
Agreement Date Shareholders (the "Other Selling Shareholders") will also sell
all of their Company Capital Shares to Purchaser, including as a result of the
exercise of the Drag Along Right, to the extent required.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
certain employees of the Company identified on Part 1 of Schedule B hereto
(the "Key Employees") have executed employee offer letters or employment
agreements with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser (each, a "Key Employee
Offer Letter") together with a Confidential Information, Invention Assignment
and Arbitration Agreement, if applicable, and in Purchaser's or an Affiliate
of Purchaser's standard form in the applicable jurisdiction, in each case to
become effective upon the Closing Date.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, each
Key Employee is entering into non-competition agreements with Purchaser (each,
a "Non-Competition Agreement and Non-Solicitation Agreements"), in each case
to become effective upon the Closing Date.

WHEREAS, the Company, Purchaser, the Agreement Date Shareholders and the
Selling Shareholders (excluding the Dragged Shareholders) desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
connection with the Acquisition as set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants,
representations and warranties and other premises set forth herein, the mutual
benefits to be gained by the performance thereof, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree as follows:

Article I 
SHARE PURCHASE

1.1 The Share Purchase.

(a) The Share Purchase. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and subject to the applicable provisions of applicable Law,
at the Closing, the Selling Shareholders shall sell to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase from the Selling Shareholders, the Company Capital
Shares held by the Selling Shareholders, free and clear from all Encumbrances,
and with the benefit of all rights of any nature attaching or accruing to such
Company Capital Shares, including rights to any unpaid dividends and
distributions, in consideration for the payment to the Selling Shareholders of
the applicable portion, in the aggregate, of the Total Selling Shareholders
Consideration. Purchaser shall be entitled to designate an Affiliate of
Purchaser as the purchaser of the Company Capital Shares and the Selling
Shareholders hereby expressly consent to such designation right; provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such designation shall relieve Purchaser
from its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Consideration. The consideration for the purchase by Purchaser of the
Company Securities (which shall include the cash cancellation of any Company
Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) (excluding the
Company Securities held by Purchaser) shall be the Total Acquisition
Consideration, payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

1.2 Effect on Company Securities. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of any Company
Security Holder:

(a) Company Capital Shares. At the Closing, subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 1.5, Purchaser shall procure payment to the Payment
Agent for onward payment to each Selling Shareholder who holds Company Capital
Shares an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the applicable Per Share
Consideration with respect to each Company Capital Share held by the Selling
Shareholder immediately prior to the Closing. The amount of cash each Selling
Shareholder is entitled to receive for the Company Capital Shares held by such
Selling Shareholder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after
aggregating cash amounts for all Company Capital Shares held by such Selling
Shareholder.

(b) Company Options.

(i) Vested Company Options. No Vested Company Options shall be assumed or
continued by the Company in connection with the Acquisition or the other
Transactions. As of immediately prior to the Closing, each Non-Continuing
Employee Accelerated Company Option and each Transition Employee DT Option
shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full. At the Closing, each
Vested Company Option that is then outstanding shall be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive, with respect to each share
subject thereto, and subject to the execution and delivery by such Company
Option Holder of an option cancellation agreement (which shall include a
customary release of claims against the Company and Purchaser) in a form to be
mutually agreed by the Company and Purchaser prior to the Closing Date (an
"Option Cancellation Agreement"), an amount in cash, without interest, equal
to the excess, if any, of the Per Ordinary Share Consideration for each
Company Ordinary Share issuable upon the exercise in full of such Vested
Company Option, over the per share exercise price of such Vested Company
Option (such excess amount being hereinafter referred to as the "Vested
Company Option Cash Out Amount"), payable in accordance with Section 2.3(b).
For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of consideration payable in
respect of each Vested Company Option pursuant to this Section 1.2(b)(i), (x)
all shares of Company Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of
the Vested Company Options held by each holder of Vested Company Options shall
be aggregated and (y) the amount of cash to be paid to each such holder of
Vested Company Options shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) Unvested Company Options. No Unvested Company Options shall be assumed or
continued by Purchaser and the Company in connection with the Acquisition or
the other Transactions. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Closing, by virtue of the Acquisition and without
any further action on the part of Purchaser, the Company, or the holders or
recipients of Unvested Company Options, each Unvested Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be cancelled and
extinguished for no consideration or shall lapse and shall cease to exist.

(iii) Necessary Actions. Prior to the Closing Date, and subject to the prior
review and approval of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to effect the transactions anticipated by this Section 1.2(b) under the Plans
and any Contract applicable to any Company Option (whether written or oral,
formal or informal), including delivering all required notices, obtaining all
necessary approvals and consents, and delivering evidence satisfactory to
Purchaser that all necessary determinations by the Company Board or applicable
committee of the Company Board to terminate all Company Options in accordance
with this Section 1.2(b) have been made. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to terminate the Plans prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Company Warrants.

(i) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or otherwise
replace a Company Warrant in connection with the Acquisition or the other
Transactions. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, by virtue of the Acquisition and the Warrant
Cancellation Agreements in respect of the Company Warrants and without any
action on the part of Purchaser, the Company, or the holders of Company
Warrants (each such holder as of immediately prior to the Closing, a "Company
Warrantholder"), each Company Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall be cancelled, extinguished and shall cease to exist. In
exchange for the cancellation and extinguishment of the Company Warrants
pursuant to this Section 1.2(c)(i), each person who, at the Closing Date, was
holding a Company Warrant shall receive an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to, in respect of each Company Ordinary Shares Warrant, the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Per Ordinary Share Consideration, without
interest, over the per share exercise price of such Company Ordinary Shares
Warrant and (y) the number of shares of Company Ordinary Shares into which
such Company Ordinary Shares Warrant is convertible pursuant to the terms of
its governing documents, in each case as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date ("Warrant Consideration"). Company Ordinary Shares Warrants with a per
share exercise price greater than or equal to the Per Ordinary Share
Consideration ("Out-of-the-Money Warrants") shall be cancelled without
consideration. Payment of Warrant Consideration to any holder of Company
Warrants entitled thereto shall be made at such time(s) provided in this
Agreement to the Payment Agent for onward payment to the Company
Warrantholders that would receive consideration under this Section 1.2(c). For
purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of consideration payable in
respect of a Company Warrant pursuant to this Section 1.2(c)(i), (x) all
shares of Company Capital Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of the
Company Warrants held by each holder of Company Warrants shall be aggregated
and (y) the amount of cash to be paid to each such holder of Company Warrants
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) The Company shall, promptly after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, take or cause to be taken all actions (including providing any
notices and obtaining Warrant Cancellation Agreements from each Company
Warrantholder in a form to be mutually agreed to by Purchaser and the Company)
that are required under any Company Warrant, or are otherwise reasonably
necessary or appropriate to cause the Company Warrants to be treated in
accordance with this Section 1.2(c)(ii), and shall ensure that any exercise of
a Company Warrant occur at least five Business Days prior to Closing.

1.3 Working Capital and Cash Adjustments.

(a) Pre-Closing Statements. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser (i) a statement prepared in
accordance with the Sample Working Capital Statement and that is reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser (the "Pre-Closing WC Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimate of (A) Closing Working
Capital and (B) Closing Working Capital Adjustment (including all components
thereof) (such estimate the "Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment")
and (ii) a written statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth
the Company's good faith estimate of (A) Closing Cash (such estimate, the
"Estimated Closing Cash"), (B) Closing Indebtedness (such estimate, the
"Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), and (C) Closing Third Party Expenses (such
estimate, the "Estimated Closing Third Party Expenses"), in each case,
accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up documentation for such calculations
upon receipt of written request to do so from the Purchaser (the Pre-Closing
WC Statement and together with the Estimated Closing Statement, the "Pre-
Closing Statements" and each a "Pre-Closing Statement"). The Company shall
prepare the Pre-Closing WC Statement in accordance with the Company Accounting
Principles. The Company shall make available to Purchaser and its
Representatives the work papers (subject to the execution of customary work
paper access letters, if requested) and other books and records used in
preparing the Pre-Closing WC Statement and Estimated Closing Statement and
reasonable access to employees of the Company as Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with its review of such statements, and will otherwise
cooperate in good faith with Purchaser's and its Representatives review of
such statements and shall take into consideration in good faith any comments
of Purchaser on the Pre-Closing WC Statement or the Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable (it being understood that Purchaser shall not have
any approval right in respect of the Pre-Closing Statements). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event will any of Purchaser's rights be considered
waived, impaired or otherwise limited as a result of Purchaser not making an
objection prior to the Closing or its making an objection that is not fully
implemented in a revised Pre-Closing WC Statement or Estimated Closing
Statement, as applicable.

(b) Post-Closing WC Statement; Post-Closing General Statement. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 60 calendar days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and
delivered, to the Shareholders' Representative (i), a statement (the "Post-
Closing WC Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Purchaser's
calculations of (ii) the Closing Working Capital (including all components
thereof), and (iii) a statement (the "Post-Closing General Statement" and
together with the Post-Closing WC Statement, the "Post-Closing Statements",
and each a "Post-Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail
Purchaser's calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing
Third Party Expenses, and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (as defined
below). Purchaser shall prepare such Post-Closing Statement in accordance with
the Company Accounting Principles.

(c) Review of Post-Closing Statements. The Shareholders' Representative shall
have 30 calendar days following its receipt of any Post-Closing Statements
(the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing Statements. During the Review
Period, the Resolutions Period and any additional period until all items in
the Dispute Statement are finally resolved as provided in Section 1.3(d),
Purchaser and the Company shall make available to the Shareholders'
Representative and its Representatives the work papers (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters, if requested) and other
books and records used in preparing each of the Post-Closing Statements and
reasonable access (on prior notice and during business hours) to employees of
the Company as the Shareholders' Representative (or its Representatives) may
reasonably request in connection with its review of such statements. On or
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Shareholders' Representative
shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement accepting or disputing each
item set forth on the Post-Closing Statements. In the event that the
Shareholders' Representative disputes an item on a Post-Closing Statement, the
Shareholders' Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (a
"Dispute Statement") that includes (i) a reasonably detailed itemization of
the Shareholders' Representative's objections and the reasons therefor,
together with supporting documentation, information and calculations and (ii)
the Shareholders' Representative's alternative calculation of each disputed
item. Any component of a Post-Closing Statement that is not disputed in a
Dispute Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and not
subject to appeal. If the Shareholders' Representative does not deliver a
Dispute Statement to Purchaser within the Review Period or delivers a
statement accepting all items detailed on one or both of the Post-Closing
Statements, such Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal.

(d) Dispute Resolution. If the Shareholders' Representative delivers a Dispute
Statement during the Review Period, Purchaser and the Shareholders'
Representative shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the 30 calendar days immediately following Purchaser's
receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Purchaser and the
Shareholders' Representative may mutually agree (the "Resolution Period"). Any
such disputed items that are resolved by Purchaser and the Shareholders'
Representative during the Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If Purchaser and the Shareholders'
Representative do not resolve all such disputed items by the end of the
Resolution Period, Purchaser and the Shareholders' Representative shall submit
all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute Statement to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other independent public accounting firm of
national standing mutually acceptable to the Shareholders' Representative and
Purchaser (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution. The Accounting
Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall
make all calculations in accordance with the Company Accounting Principles,
shall determine only those items remaining in dispute between Purchaser and
the Shareholders' Representative, and shall not be permitted or authorized to
assign a dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. Each of Purchaser and the Shareholders'
Representative shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the
opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material
to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective positions with respect
to such disputed items and to submit a written statement responding to the
other party's position with respect to such disputed items and (iii) subject
to customary confidentiality agreements, provide the Accounting Firm with
access to their respective books, records, personnel and representatives and
such other information as the Accounting Firm may require in order to render
its determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to deliver to
Purchaser and the Shareholders' Representative a written determination (such
determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Purchaser and the Shareholders'
Representative) of the disputed items within 30 calendar days of receipt of
the disputed items, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal, absent manifest error or fraud. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Purchaser, on the
one hand, and the Shareholders' Representative (first out of the Expense Fund,
and only after the Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the Company
Indemnitors directly), on the other hand, based on a percentage equal to (x)
the portion of the total amounts disputed not awarded to each such party
divided by (y) the total amounts disputed. For example, if the Shareholders'
Representative challenges the calculation of the Closing Working Capital by an
amount of $100,000, but the Accounting Firm determines that the Shareholders'
Representative has a valid claim for only $60,000, the Shareholders'
Representative will bear (first out of the Expense Fund, and only after the
Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the Company Indemnitors directly) forty
percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and Purchaser
will bear the other sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses. For
clarity, except with respect to claims of fraud, the process set forth in this
Section 1.3(d) shall be the exclusive remedy for disputes related to the
Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital Adjustment, and Closing Cash
set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statements, or the
Dispute Statement.

(e) Post-Closing Payments.

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.3) is negative (the absolute value of such negative amount, the
"Post-Closing Deficit"), then the Participating Sellers shall owe Purchaser

Closing Spreadsheet pursuant to Section 6.9(j), net of any withholding, and

Balance shall be satisfied by being deducted from any portion of the Closing
Acquisition Consideration otherwise due to such Company Employee under Section
1.2, and (b) if the Outstanding Balance is greater than the Company Employee's

Purchaser or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required

Company Share Certificates.

(h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Shares. The cash amounts
paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be

2.3, none of Purchaser, the Payment Agent, the Company, nor any other party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount paid to a public official

contrary in any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, except for
representations and warranties made expressly to Purchaser pursuant to this

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE WARRANTOR

Subject to the disclosures set forth in the disclosure letter of the Warrantor
dated as of the Agreement Date and delivered to Purchaser concurrently with
the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Letter") (each of which
disclosures shall clearly indicate the Section and, if applicable, the
Subsection of this Article III to which it relates (unless and only to the
extent the relevance to other representations and warranties is reasonably
apparent from the actual text of the disclosure on its face), and each of
which disclosures shall also be deemed to be representations and warranties
made by the Selling Shareholders to Purchaser under this Article III), the
Warrantor represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

3.1 Organization, Good Standing, Power and Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. The Company has
the corporate power to own, operate, distribute and lease its properties and
to conduct its business as now being conducted and as currently proposed by it
to be conducted and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified and in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate with any such other failures, would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation
("Certificate of Incorporation") or Articles or other governing documents.
Other than as set forth on Schedule 3.1(e)-1 of the Disclosure Letter, the
Company has no Subsidiaries, and has never had any Subsidiaries, nor does the
Company control, directly or indirectly, or have any direct or indirect equity
ownership of or participation in any other Person. The Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest
in, any Person.

jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has been in continuous
existence since its incorporation or formation, applicable. Each Subsidiary
has the requisite power to own its assets and properties and to carry on its
business as currently conducted. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing as a non-U.S. corporation in each
jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would be material to the Company. A true,
correct and complete copy of each Subsidiary's charter or formation documents
and bylaws, and all other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiary,
each as amended to date and in full force and effect on the Agreement Date,
has been made available to Purchaser. All of the outstanding shares of each
Subsidiary are owned of record and beneficially by the Company and are listed
on Schedule 3.1(e)-2 of the Disclosure Letter. All outstanding shares of each
Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable

Authorizations are in full force and effect, except for failures to obtain
licenses or maintain licenses in full force and effect that are, individually

granted so as to qualify as an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section
422 of the Code. Each Company Preferred Share is convertible on a one-share
for one-share basis into Company Ordinary Shares. All issued and outstanding

requirements set forth in the Charter Documents and any applicable Contracts
to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its assets

Company Option Holders are Persons that are not employees of the Company
(including non-employee directors, consultants, advisory board members,
vendors, service providers or other similar Persons), including a description
of the relationship between each such Person and the Company. True, correct
and complete copies of the Plans and each standard form award agreement and
instrument relating to or issued under each Plan have been provided to
Purchaser, together with details of the individuals who have been granted
Company Options on such standard forms (by reference to their jurisdiction of
residence and/or status as employee, non-employee director or independent
contractor), and such Plans and Contracts comply with, and have been operated
in compliance with, applicable Law, have not been amended, modified or
supplemented since being provided to Purchaser, and no Company Options differ

determined in accordance with Section 1.2(c) if such Company Warrant remains
outstanding as of the Closing and, upon payment of such consideration on the
Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the
delivery of the Warrant Cancellation Agreements, each outstanding Company
Warrant shall, by virtue of such payment and without any further action by any
Person not contemplated by this Agreement or the Company Warrant,
automatically terminate and be cancelled and shall thereafter be of no further
force and effect. Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have no further
Liability under or with respect to any such Company Warrant except for the
payment of the consideration contemplated by Section 1.2(c).

(d) As of the Agreement Date, there are no authorized, issued or outstanding
Equity Interests of the Company or any Subsidiary other than shares of Company
Capital Shares, Company Warrants and Company Options. Other than as set forth
on Schedule 3.5(a), Schedule 3.5(b)-1 and Schedule 3.5(c) of the Disclosure
Letter, as of the Agreement Date, no Person has any Equity Interests of the
Company or any Subsidiary, stock appreciation rights, stock units, share

obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate
the vesting and/or repurchase rights of, change the price of, or otherwise
amend or enter into any such Company Option, call, right or Contract.

(e) There is no Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary (i) granting its
holder the right to vote on any matters on which any Company Security Holder
may vote (or that is convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having
such right) or (ii) the value of which is in any way based upon or derived
from capital or voting stock of the Company, is issued or outstanding as of
the Agreement Date (collectively, "Company Voting Debt").

(f) There are no Contracts relating to voting, purchase, sale or transfer of
any Company Capital Shares (i) between or among the Company or any Subsidiary
and any Company Security Holder, other than written Contracts granting the
Company the right to purchase unvested shares upon termination of employment
or service, and (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company, between or among any of
the Company Security Holders. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(f) of the
Disclosure Letter, neither the Plans nor any Contract of any character to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or by which the
Company, any Subsidiary, or any assets of the Company or any Subsidiary is
bound relating to any Company Options requires or otherwise provides for any
accelerated vesting of any Company Options or the acceleration of any other
benefits thereunder, in each case in connection with the Transactions or upon
termination of employment or service with the Company, any Subsidiary, or
Purchaser, or any other event, whether before, upon or following the Closing
Date or otherwise.

(g) As of the Closing, (i) the number of shares of Company Capital Shares set
forth in the Closing Spreadsheet as being owned by a Person, or subject to
Company Options owned by such Person, will constitute the entire interest of
such Person in the issued and outstanding Company Capital Shares or any other
Equity Interests of the Company, (ii) no Person not disclosed in the Closing
Spreadsheet will have a right to acquire from the Company any shares of
Company Capital Shares, Company Options, Company Warrants, or any other Equity

will be free and clear of any Encumbrances.

3.6 Company Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of
Changes.

(a) The Company has delivered to Purchaser its unaudited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and its
audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (including, in each case, balance
sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows) (collectively,
the "Financial Statements"), which are included as Schedule 3.6(a) of the
Disclosure Letter. The Financial Statements for the years ended December 31,
2019 and December 31, 2018 (i) are derived from and in accordance with the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) complied as to
form with applicable accounting requirements with respect thereto as of their
respective dates as historically applied by the Company, (iii) fairly and
accurately present in all material respects the consolidated financial
condition of the Company at the dates therein indicated and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the periods therein
specified (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal
recurring year-end audit adjustments, none of which individually or in the
aggregate are or will be material in amount), and (iv) were prepared in
accordance with the Company Accounting Principles, except for the absence of
footnotes in the unaudited Financial Statements, applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated and consistent with each other.

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any Liabilities of any nature
other than (i) those set forth on or adequately provided for in the balance
sheet included in the Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019 (the
"Company Balance Sheet"), (ii) those incurred in the conduct of the Company's
business since December 31, 2019 (the "Company Balance Sheet Date") in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice that are of the type that
ordinarily recur, and do not result from any breach of Contract, warranty,
infringement, tort or violation of Law, (iii) those incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution of this Agreement and (iv)
those arising under Material Contracts (other than the payment of liquidated
damages or arising as a result of a default or breach thereof) in accordance
with their terms, which are readily apparent to Purchaser from the actual text
of the Material Contracts, and which are not required to be identified as
liabilities in a balance sheet prepared under U.K. GAAP. Except for
Liabilities reflected in the Financial Statements, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any off-balance sheet Liability of any nature to, or any
financial interest in, any third parties or entities, the purpose or effect of
which is to defer, postpone, reduce or otherwise avoid or adjust the recording
of expenses incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has ever guaranteed any debt or other obligation of any other
Person. All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance
Sheet have been established in accordance with U.K. GAAP as consistently
applied by the Company for pre-Closing periods and are adequate. For clarity,
the mere existence of a claim, complaint or notice from a third party
involving the Company and/or the Subsidiaries arising after the Agreement Date
shall not in itself constitute a breach of this Section 3.6(b) on the theory
that such claim (absent an underlying breach of another applicable
representation, warranty or covenant) constitutes an unknown, contingent,
unmatured or other debt, liability or obligation of the Company and/or the
Subsidiaries.

(c) Schedule 3.6(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the Agreement
Date a true, correct and complete list of all Company Indebtedness, including,
for each item of Company Indebtedness, the agreement governing the Company
Indebtedness, any assets securing such Company Indebtedness and any prepayment
or other penalties payable in connection with the repayment of such Company
Indebtedness at the Closing.

(d) Schedule 3.6(d) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the Agreement
Date the names and locations of all banks and other financial institutions at
which the Company or its Subsidiaries maintain accounts, indicating in each
case the account number and the names of all Persons authorized to make
withdrawals therefrom.

(e) The Company and each Subsidiary has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurances (i)
that transactions, receipts and expenditures of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are being executed and made only in accordance with appropriate
authorizations of management and the Company Board, (ii) that transactions are
recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.K. GAAP and (B) to maintain accountability for assets, (iii)
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of Company and (iv) the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been recorded in conformity with U.K. GAAP. None of the
Company, any Subsidiary, the Company's independent auditors nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any Company Employee or former employee, consultant,
advisor or director of the Company or any Subsidiary, has identified or been
made aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Company's
or such Subsidiary's management or other Company Employee or former employees,
consultants directors of the Company or such Subsidiary who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by the Company or such Subsidiary, or any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing. None of the Company, any Subsidiary nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any Representative of the Company or any
Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, in each
case, regarding deficient accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary or its internal
accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the Company's financial
statements. There are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in
the design or operation of the Company's internal controls. There has been no
material change in the Company's accounting policies since January 1, 2016,
except as described in the Financial Statements.

(f) Except for the transactions specifically contemplated in this Agreement,
since the Company Balance Sheet Date, (i) the Company and each Subsidiary has
conducted its business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (ii) there has not occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary and (iii) none of the Company
nor any Subsidiary has done, caused or permitted any actions that would
violate Section 5.2 (other than clauses (f), (r) and (s) and grants of Company
Options) if taken after the Agreement Date.

(g) The accounts receivable as reflected on the Company Balance Sheet arose in
the ordinary course of business and represented bona fide claims against
debtors for sales and other charges. Allowances for doubtful accounts have
been prepared in accordance with U.K. GAAP as consistently applied by the
Company for pre-Closing periods and in accordance with the Company's past
practice. The accounts receivable of the Company arising after the Company
Balance Sheet Date and before the Closing Date arose or shall arise in the
ordinary course of business and represented or shall represent bona fide
claims against debtors for sales and other charges. None of the accounts
receivable of the Company is subject to any claim of offset, recoupment,
setoff or counter-claim, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
specific facts or circumstances (whether asserted or unasserted) that could
give rise to any such claim. No amount of accounts receivable is contingent
upon the performance by the Company of any obligation or Contract other than
normal warranty repair and replacement. No Person has any Encumbrance on any
of such accounts receivable and no agreement for deduction or discount has
been made with respect to any of such accounts receivable.

3.7 Tax Matters.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly completed and timely
filed, or caused to be properly completed and timely filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by it and has timely paid all Taxes required to be paid
by it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return). All such Tax Returns were
complete and accurate in all material respects when filed and were prepared in
compliance with Law. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries maintain, in all
material respects, complete and accurate records, invoices and other
information in relation to Tax, that meet all legal requirements and enable
the Company to calculate any Tax liability or Relief and to deliver Tax
Returns which are correct and complete in all material respects. The Company
and each of its Subsidiaries are not, and have not at any time with the last
six years been, liable to pay any interest, penalty or surcharge in respect of
any unpaid Tax or as a result of a default in respect of any Tax matter or are
otherwise subject to the operation of any penal provision under any enactment
relating to Tax. There is no claim for Taxes that has resulted in an
Encumbrance against any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability for any Taxes pursuant to Section 965 of the Code.

(b) The Company has delivered to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies
of all income, sales and use, VAT, and other material Tax Returns for the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods remaining open
under the applicable statute of limitations, and all examination reports and
statements of deficiencies, adjustments and proposed deficiencies and
adjustments in respect of Taxes of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
which remain outstanding. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are not and
will not be required to file a Tax Return following the Closing with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period other than in their respective jurisdictions of
incorporation. No written claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity
in a jurisdiction where the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) does not file
Tax Returns that the Company (or such Subsidiary) is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received nor requested any private letter ruling from the IRS (or any
comparable Tax ruling from any other Governmental Entity). No power of
attorney with respect to Taxes has been granted with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than authorizations to contact Tax Return
preparers that were included in Tax Returns filed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) that will remain in effect after the Closing.

(c) The unpaid Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of the
Company Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Liability for Taxes (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Company Balance
Sheet and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. Since the Company
Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses,
as that term is used in GAAP, outside the ordinary course of business
consistent with past custom and practice. No accounting period of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for corporation tax purposes has ended, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any distribution, since the
Company Balance Sheet Date. The Company and its Subsidiaries have identified
all uncertain tax positions contained in all Tax Returns filed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries and has established adequate reserves and made any
appropriate disclosures in the Financials in accordance with the requirements
of ASC 740-10 and ASC 450-20 or U.K. GAAP equivalent.

(d) There is no ongoing, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Action associated with, any Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that is being conducted by a Tax Authority and no
Action associated with any Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been conducted by a Tax Authority within the four year period
ending on the Agreement Date. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received from any Tax Authority (including jurisdictions where the Company
has not filed Tax Returns) any (i) written (or, to the Company's Knowledge,
oral) notice indicating an intent to open an audit, enquiry or other review,
(ii) written request for information related to Tax matters, or (iii) notice
of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted,
or assessed by any Tax Authority against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There is no waiver or extension of any statute of limitations on
the assessment of any Taxes granted with respect to any Tax Return of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently in effect, and no agreement to
any extension of time for filing any Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding, for clarity, routine extensions available by statute)
that has not been filed.

(e) The Company's US Subsidiary has disclosed on its Tax Returns any Tax
reporting position taken in any Tax Return that could result in the imposition
of penalties under Section 6662 of the Code or any comparable provisions of
U.S. state or local applicable Law. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has consummated or participated in, or is currently participating
in, any transaction that was or is a "tax shelter" transaction as defined in
Sections 6662 or 6111 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated
in, or is currently participating in, a "listed transaction" or a "reportable
transaction" within the meaning of Section 6707A(c) of the Code or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

(a) Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been involved in or a
party to any scheme, arrangement, transaction or series of transactions either
(i) the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of which was or might be
held to have been the avoidance, deferral or reduction of Tax on the part of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) that produced a loss for Tax
purposes with no corresponding commercial loss, or (iii) containing one or
more steps which have no commercial purpose other than avoiding, deferring or
saving Tax or obtaining a Tax advantage on the part of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has at any
time entered into or been party to any transactions, schemes or arrangements
which either were notifiable arrangements for the purposes of Part 7 Finance
Act 2004 or was a notifiable scheme for the purposes of Schedule 11A VATA
1994.

(b) None of the Company, any of its predecessors or any of its Subsidiaries
has (i) ever been a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
group of which the Company or any predecessor of the Company was not the
ultimate parent corporation, (ii) ever been a party to or bound by any Tax
sharing, Tax indemnity, Tax allocation or similar agreement with any third
party relating to allocating, indemnification or sharing the payment of, or
Liability for, Taxes (other than an agreement entered into in the ordinary
course of business, no principal purpose of which is the sharing,
indemnification or allocation of Taxes), (iii) or is likely to have any
Liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) including under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or
any similar provision of U.S. state or local, or non-US Law, or under any
arrangement for group or consortium relief or similar arrangement) as a
transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise (other than by an agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of business, no principal purpose of which
is the sharing, indemnification or allocation of Taxes), or (iv) ever been a
party to any joint venture, partnership or other Contract or arrangement that
could reasonably expected to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes.

(c) Seal Software Inc is and always has been a corporation taxable under
subchapter C of the Code for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, and Apogee
Legal LLC has, since the date of its acquisition by the Company, been
classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and
each of the foregoing entities has had comparable status under the Laws of any
other jurisdiction in which it has filed any Tax Return at the time it was
required to file such Tax Return. Schedule 3.7(h) of the Disclosure Letter
lists any entity classification elections made under Section 7701 of the Code
with respect to any of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries use the accrual method of accounting for income Tax
purposes.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, will be required to include any adjustment in
Taxable income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) pursuant to Section 481
or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under U.S. state or local, or
non-US Tax Laws as a result of transactions, events or accounting methods
employed prior to the Acquisition.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been or will be
required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material
item of deduction from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any (i) change in method
of accounting made on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement"
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of U.S. state or local, or non-US Tax Law) executed on or prior to
the Closing Date, (iii) intercompany transactions (including any intercompany
transaction subject to Section 367 or 482 of the Code) or any excess loss

any corresponding or similar provision of U.S. state or local, or non-US Tax
Law) with respect to a transaction occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
(iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, (v) election under Section 108(i) of the Code made on or prior

Section 965(h) of the Code made on or prior to the Closing Date.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever (i) been a
"United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, (ii) made an election pursuant to Section
897(i) of the Code to be taxed as a U.S. corporation, or (iii) constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for Tax-free treatment under Section
355 or Section 361 of the Code.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is (or has, in the six
year period ending on the Agreement Date, been) resident for Tax purposes in
any jurisdiction other than its country of incorporation or subject to Tax in
any jurisdiction other than its country of incorporation, including by virtue
of having employees, a permanent establishment or any other fixed place of
business in such other jurisdiction. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have in their possession official government receipts for any Taxes paid by
them to any Tax Authorities for which receipts have been provided. The Company
has provided to Purchaser all documentation relating to any applicable Tax
holidays or incentives that is not generally available to Persons without
specific application therefor that have current applicability to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are
currently in compliance with the requirements for any such applicable Tax
holidays or incentives and have been in compliance since such holiday or
incentive was originally claimed by the Company or such Subsidiary, in each
case, in all material respects.

(h) No Tax Authority has agreed to operate any special arrangement which has
current applicability (being an arrangement not based on a strict and detailed
application of the relevant legislation) in relation to the affairs of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action which would or might alter, prejudice or in
any way disturb any such special arrangement or agreement which it has
negotiated with any Tax Authority nor will any transaction carried out
pursuant to this Agreement have such an effect. All clearances and consents
obtained by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries from any Tax Authority
within the period of four years preceding the Agreement Date have been fully
disclosed in the Disclosure Letter and were based on full and accurate
disclosure of all the facts and circumstances material to the decision of the
Tax Authority. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all
respects with any conditions to which any such consents or clearances are
subject and have not taken any action which would reasonably be expected to
alter, prejudice or in any way disturb any such consent or clearance.

(i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have (i) complied in all material
respects with all Laws relating to the payment, reporting and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446, 1471, 1472 and 3406 of the Code or similar provisions under any non-U.S.
Law), and (ii) collected or withheld (within the time and in the manner
prescribed by Law) from any amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent

Contribution Act, Medicare, Federal Unemployment Tax Act, relevant state
income and employment Tax withholding Laws.

(j) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable transfer pricing Laws and regulations, including
the execution and maintenance of contemporaneous documentation substantiating
the transfer pricing practices and methodology of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (as required under Section 482 of the Code and any other
applicable federal, state, local or U.K. Laws and regulations). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a qualified cost sharing
arrangement within the meaning of Section 1.482-7 of the Treasury Regulations
or any other arrangement to share research and development costs and jointly
own or exploit rights to any developed Intellectual Property.

(k) To the extent required by applicable Law, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports and have created and/or retained
all records required under Sections 6038, 6038A, 6038B, 6038C, 6046 and 6046A
of the Code (and any comparable provisions of any non-U.S. Tax Law). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred intangible property in
a transfer which was subject to the rules of Section 367(d) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any gain

has delivered or made available to Purchaser true, correct and complete copies
of all election statements under Section 83(b) of the Code, together with
evidence of timely filing of such election statements with the appropriate IRS
Center with respect to any Company Restricted Stock, in each case that are in
the Company's possession. In relation to all employment-related securities (as
defined in Section 421B(8) ITEPA) in relation to which the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries is, has been or will be the employer (as defined in Section
421B(8) ITEPA), each relevant employee or officer who is or may be subject to
Tax in the United Kingdom has entered into an election pursuant to Section
431(1) ITEPA in the form approved by HMRC no later than 14 days after the
acquisition of the employment-related securities (by him or any other person)
and in relation to all securities options (as defined for the purposes of
Chapter 5 Part 7 ITEPA), such an election is required to be entered into by
the relevant employee or officer as a condition of exercise of the option
where the relevant employee or officer is or may be subject to Tax in the
United Kingdom.

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been, a party
to any Contract, arrangement or plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) that has
not been at all times in documentary and operational compliance with Section
409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder in all
material respects. No additional Tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code
has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by a participant in any such
Company Employee Plan or other Contract, plan, program, agreement, or
arrangement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise obligated under, any Contract that provides for the gross-up of
Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. No event has occurred that
would be treated by Section 409A(b) as a transfer of property for purposes of
Section 83 of the Code.

(n) The exercise price of all Company Options held by Company Option Holders
who are subject to taxation in the U.S. is at least equal to the fair market
value of the Company Ordinary Shares on the date such Company Options were
granted or repriced, and neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
Purchaser has incurred or will incur any Liability or obligation to withhold
Taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting of any Company Options.
All Company Options held by Company Option Holders who are subject to taxation
in the U.S. constitute options to purchase "service recipient stock" (as
defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)) with respect to the
grantor thereof.

(o) No person has acquired a right to acquire shares or securities, or has
acquired any shares or securities, which in either case may give rise to a
liability in respect of income tax or National Insurance contributions (or
other payroll or social security Taxes) on the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries upon the exercise or disposal of that right or upon the
acquisition or disposal of those shares or securities.

(p) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries or any employee benefit
trust or other third party has made, or agreed to make, any payment to, or
provided or agreed to provide any benefit for, any director or former
director, officer or employee (or associate of any of the foregoing) of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries within the period of six years preceding
the Agreement Date. The Disclosure Letter contains details of any payments or
loans made to, any assets made available or transferred to, or any assets
earmarked, however informally, for the benefit of, any employee or former
employee (or anyone linked with such employee or former employee) of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries by an employee benefit trust or another
third party, falling within the provisions of Part 7A of ITEPA and details of
any trust or arrangement capable of conferring such a benefit (other than for
the avoidance of doubt the RSU Awards and PSU Awards).

(q) No part of the consideration for the Company Securities will be treated as
employment income, whether as employment income of any Company Shareholder or
any other person (other than the Employee Company Options). There is no
arrangement, formal or informal between the Company Shareholders to
redistribute (or which has the effect of redistributing) the consideration
payable under the Agreement, or for any payment to be made to, or for any
benefit to be received by, any current, former or prospective employee or
office holder of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions.

(r) The Disclosure Letter sets out full details of all RandD Claims by the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries made within the period of six years
preceding the Agreement Date. All such claims have been duly made on a proper
basis within applicable time limits, and HMRC have not disputed or challenged
and, so far as the Company Indemnitors are aware, are not likely to dispute or
challenge the Company or relevant Subsidiary's entitlement to make any such
claim and/or the amount of any such claim. Any expenditure by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which has been included in such RandD Claim or to which
such RandD Claim relates qualifies for relief under one or more of Chapters 2 to
4 of Part 13 CTA 2009.

(s) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a close
investment-holding company as defined in section 34 of the CTA 2010. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been treated as making a
distribution within Section 1064 CTA 2010 (payments, etc. to participators and
associates) within the period of six years preceding the Agreement Date. No
loan or advance or debt within Sections 455, 459 or 460 CTA 2010 has been (or
treated as having been) incurred, made or agreed to be made by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries within the period of six years preceding the Agreement
Date, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has since the
Company Balance Sheet Date released, written off or agreed to release or write
off the whole or part of any such loan or advance. No arrangements are or have
been within the period of six years preceding the Agreement Date in place that
give rise or, to the Company's Knowledge, could give rise to a charge to tax
under Section 464A CTA 2010.

(t) No distribution or deemed distribution, within the meaning of Section 1000
or Sections 1022-1027 CTA 2010, has been made (or will be deemed to have been
made) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the period of six years
preceding the Agreement Date, except dividends shown in its audited accounts,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound or liable to make
any such distribution. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has not,
within the period of seven years preceding the Agreement Date, been engaged
in, or been a party to, any of the transactions set out in Chapter 5 of Part
23 CTA 2010 (demergers).

(u) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances in existence as a result
of which any of them may become liable, to be assessed to inheritance tax or
any other Taxation as donor or donee of any gift, or transferor or transferee
of value and there are no other circumstances by reason of which any liability
in respect of inheritance tax has arisen or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
could arise for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any charge in
relation to unpaid inheritance tax has arisen or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, could arise, in respect of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company Capital Shares.

(v) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a large company within the
meaning of regulation 3 of the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payment)
Regulations 1998, the Disclosure Letter gives details of instalments of
corporation tax paid in respect of the current accounting period and preceding
accounting period and instalments expected to be payable in respect of the
current accounting period of the Company or relevant Subsidiaries (ignoring
the effect of the Company being acquired under the terms of this Agreement).

(w) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have duly submitted all claims,
disclaimers and elections the making of which has been assumed for the
purposes of the Pre-Closing WC Statement.

(x) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are not and have never been a
member of a group of companies for any Tax purposes other than with each
other. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has within the period
of six years preceding the Agreement Date entered into, or agreed to enter
into, an election pursuant to Sections 171A of TCGA 1992, paragraph 16 of
Schedule 26 to the Finance Act 2008, or Section 792 of CTA 2009 (or paragraph
66 of Schedule 29 to the Finance Act 2002). Neither the signing of this
Agreement nor the sale, transfer cancellation or any other action taken (or
deemed to be taken for Tax purposes) in respect to the Company Securities nor
any other event since the Company Balance Sheet Date will result in any profit
or gain being deemed to accrue to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
Tax purposes and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
asset in respect of which any such liability may arise in the future. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been party to any
arrangements pursuant to section 59F of Tax Management Act 1970 (group payment
arrangements). Neither the signing of this Agreement nor the sale of the
Company Securities to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement will result in
any profit or gain being deemed to accrue to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for Tax purposes, whether pursuant to section 179 TCGA, section
780 CTA 2009 or otherwise.

(y) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
current or former employee or other service provider of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to which the Company or such Subsidiary is a party or by
which the Company, such Subsidiary or any of their assets is bound that,
considered individually or collectively with any other such agreements, plans,
arrangements or other Contracts, will, or would reasonably be expected to, as
a result of the Transactions (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events), give rise directly or indirectly to the
payment of any amount that would be characterized as a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of U.S. state or local, or non-U.S. Tax Law). No securities
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Security Holder is
readily tradable on an established securities market or otherwise (within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder) such that the Company is ineligible to seek shareholder approval
in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code.

(z) All documents in the possession of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or to the production of which such entity is entitled, and which attract stamp
or transfer duty or taxes, have been properly stamped. Neither entering into
this Agreement nor Closing will result in the withdrawal of any stamp duty,
stamp duty land tax, transfer or registration tax relief granted on or before
Closing which will affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(aa) No member of the Company Group has made any applications to defer payment
of any stamp duty land tax (or any corresponding or similar stamp or transfer
duty or tax) and no circumstance exists where any consideration paid is
contingent, uncertain or unascertained within the meaning of Section 51 of the
U.K. Finance Act 2003 in circumstances which could result in any member of the
Company Group becoming liable to stamp duty land tax (or further stamp duty
land tax) in the future. No assignment of any lease owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will be treated as being the grant of lease under
paragraph 11 of Schedule 17A of the Finance Act 2003.

(bb) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have in place (and have had in
place at all times since September 30, 2017) such prevention procedures (as
defined in sections 45(3) and 46(4) of CFA 2017) as are proportionate to their
business risk and are in line with any guidance published from time to time
pursuant to Section 47 of CFA 2017.

(cc) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or any person acting in
the capacity of a person associated with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, is or has been the subject of any investigation, inquiry or
enforcement proceedings regarding any offence or alleged offence under Part 3
of the CFA 2017, and no such investigation, inquiry or enforcement proceedings
have been threatened or are pending and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no circumstances likely to give rise to any such investigation,
inquiry or proceedings.

(dd) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in or
cooperated with, or has agreed to participate in or cooperate with, an
international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code.

(ee) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have collected, remitted and
reported to the appropriate Tax Authority all sales, use and value added Taxes
required to be so collected, remitted or reported pursuant to all applicable
Tax Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all
respects with all applicable Laws relating to record retention (including to
the extent necessary to claim any exemption from sales or value added Tax
collection and maintaining adequate and current resale certificates to support
any such claimed exemption), except for such non-compliance that is,
individually or in the aggregate, de minimis.

(ff) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are, where they ought to have
been so registered, a duly registered taxable person for the purposes of VAT,
and are not, nor have they in the last three years been, wholly or partly
exempt for such purposes.

(gg) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
arrangements which are subject to counteraction under Part 6A of the Taxation
(International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 (including any arrangements
which might be subject to counteraction thereunder if no counteraction applies
under the law of a territory outside the U.K.).

(hh) As of the Closing, the Company will be a "controlled foreign corporation"
as defined in Section 957(a) of the Code. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.7(mm) of the Disclosure Letter, each of the Company's other Subsidiary that
is not organized in the United States is classified as a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is a "surrogate foreign corporation" as defined in Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of
the Code. Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any of the
Company's direct or indirect shareholders) has ever been required to include
any amount as income under Section 951 or 951A of the Code, or will be
required to include any amount as income under Section 1293, Section 951 or
Section 951A of the Code were the applicable taxable year deemed to close on
the Closing Date and no such amounts have accrued or been incurred by the
Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company is not making any representation or warranty as to the amount or
availability of any net operating loss, tax credit or other tax attribute of
the Company or any Subsidiary for any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

3.8 Title to, Condition and Sufficiency of Assets.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid
leasehold interest in all of its respective properties, and interests in
properties and assets, real and personal, reflected on the Company Balance
Sheet or acquired after the Company Balance Sheet Date (except properties and
assets, or interests in properties and assets, sold or otherwise disposed of
since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), or, with respect to leased properties and
assets, valid leasehold interests in such properties and assets that afford
the Company or Subsidiary, as applicable, valid leasehold possession of the
properties and assets that are the subject of such leases, in each case, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted Encumbrances. Schedule 3.8(a)
of the Disclosure Letter identifies each parcel of real property leased by the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries. The Company has provided to Purchaser
true, correct and complete copies of all leases, subleases and other
agreements under which the Company and each Subsidiary, as applicable, uses or
occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any real
property or facility, including all modifications, amendments and supplements
thereto. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real property or has
ever owned any real property.

(b) The assets and properties owned, leased and licensed by the Company or any
Subsidiary (i) constitute all of the assets and properties that are necessary
for the Company and each Subsidiary to operate its business as currently
conducted, and to sell and otherwise enjoy full rights to exploitation of its
assets, properties and all products and services that are provided in
connection with its assets and properties and (ii) constitute all of the
assets and properties that are used in the conduct of the business of the
Company or any Subsidiary as they are currently conducted; provided that the
foregoing will not be treated as a representation of non-infringement with
respect to any Intellectual Property of any third party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.8, this Section
3.8 shall not constitute any representation or warranty with respect to
Intellectual Property.

distribution, provision or use of any Company Product or Company-Owned
Intellectual Property and (ii) the Company's use of any product, device,

the Company after the Company Balance Sheet Date). There has been no amendment
to, interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or

Plans that are "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of ERISA, including

such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide
Purchaser with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been

such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review and approval by
Purchaser. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such Company Employee Plan(s) as Purchaser may reasonably require.
In the event that termination of the Company's 401(k) Plan would reasonably be
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees
then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Purchaser.

6.12 Corporate Matters. The Company shall retain at its registered office, and
make available to Purchaser, all original minute books containing the records
of all proceedings, consents, actions and meetings of the board of directors,
committees of the boards of directors and the shareholders of the Company and

and transfers.

6.13 Tax Matters.

(a) Cooperation. Each of Purchaser, the Shareholders' Representative and the
Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any of the others, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns and any Action with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon request therefor) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to any such Action and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Purchaser, the Company, and
the Shareholders' Representative agree to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the statute of
limitations of the respective taxable periods plus 90 days, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Company Security
Holder to further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including with respect to the Transactions).

(b) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare and timely file or cause
to be prepared and timely filed (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all Tax Returns of the Company first due after the Closing Date that
include any Pre-Closing Tax Period (such Tax Returns, the "Purchaser Prepared
Returns"). Purchaser shall prepare Purchaser Prepared Returns for any taxable
period that ends on or before the Closing Date in a manner consistent with the
past practice of the Company, to the extent consistent with applicable Law,
and shall timely pay any Taxes shown thereon (subject to its indemnification
rights pursuant to this Agreement). At least 20 calendar days prior to the due
date for any Purchaser Prepared Return, taking into account any extension,
Purchaser shall provide the Shareholders' Representative with a draft copy of
such Tax Return for review and comments; provided, that no delay or failure on
the part of Purchaser in delivering any such Purchaser Prepared Return shall
cause any Indemnified Party to forfeit any indemnification rights under
Article VIII. Purchaser shall, in good faith, consider any reasonable changes
to any Purchaser Prepared Return suggested by the Shareholders' Representative
that are received by the Purchaser at least 10 calendar days prior to the
relevant due date for such Purchaser Prepared Return, taking into account any
extension.

(c) Transfer Taxes. Subject to the remainder of this Section 6.13(c) all
transfer, sales, use, conveyance, real property transfer, recording,
registration, documentary, filing and other similar non-income Taxes and
administrative fees (including notary fees) arising in connection with this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions ("Transfer Taxes") shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by the Company Security Holders and fifty percent
(50%) by Purchaser; provided that any stamp duty payable in respect of the
Transactions shall be borne solely by Purchaser. If the Agreement is
terminated on or after the Agreement Date and prior to Closing: (A) by the
Purchaser in accordance with Section 7.1(c) the Company Security Holders shall
bear the full cost of any Transfer Taxes that have arisen in connection with
entering into the Agreement; or (B) by the Company in accordance with Section
7.1(d), the Purchaser shall bear the full cost of any Transfer Taxes that have
arisen in connection with entering into the Agreement. The party responsible
by applicable law for filing any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall
be responsible for filing such Tax Return and the other party shall cooperate
with the filing party in the filing of any such Tax Returns with respect to
Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession
that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Return, and the parties
shall indemnify each other for their share of any Transfer Taxes to ensure
such Transfer Taxes are borne as specified in accordance with this Section
6.13(c).

(d) Tax Elections. Purchaser shall not make any election with respect to the
Acquisition under Section 338(g) of the Code or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law.

6.14 Parachute Payment Waivers. The Company shall obtain and deliver to
Purchaser prior to the initiation of the requisite shareholder approval
procedure under Section 6.15, a Parachute Payment Waiver from each Person who
the Company reasonably believes could be, with respect to the Company and/or
any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as
determined immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite shareholder
approval procedure under Section 6.15, and who might otherwise have, receive
or have the right or entitlement to receive a Section 280G Payment (as defined
below) to the extent the value thereof exceeds three times such Person's "base
amount" determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the Section 280G Approval (as
defined below) is obtained pursuant to Section 6.15.

6.15 280G Stockholder Solicitation. At least three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall submit to the Company Shareholders, for
approval by such Company Shareholders holding the number of shares of stock
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, a written consent
in favor of a proposal to render the parachute payment provisions of Section
280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder inapplicable to all Section
280G Payments. "Section 280G Payments" means any payments and/or benefits
provided pursuant to Company Employee Plans or other plans, programs,
arrangements or Contracts that might reasonably be expected to result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the
provision of any benefit that causes the payments and/or benefits to not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G or that would be subject to an excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code. Such shareholder approval and consent
materials shall be subject to prior reasonable review by Purchaser. Any such
shareholder approval shall be sought by the Company in a manner which
satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such
Treasury Regulations. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser written notification and documentation satisfactory to Purchaser
that (i) a vote of the holders of Company Capital Shares was solicited in
conformance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite shareholder approval was obtained with respect to
any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the shareholder vote (the
"Section 280G Approval") or (ii) that the Section 280G Approval was not
obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall not be
made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute
Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the Parachute Payment Waivers that were
executed by the affected individuals prior to the solicitation of the vote of
the holders of Company Capital Shares pursuant to this Section 6.15.

6.16 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, at the Company
Shareholders' expense, an extended reporting period endorsement (the "Company
DandO Tail Policy") under the Company's existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance coverage for the Company's directors and officers on terms
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser that shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for six years following the Closing Date and that
provides at least the same coverage in scope and amount as the existing
coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable in the aggregate
to the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage presently maintained by the Company. The cost of any Company DandO Tail
Policy shall be considered a Third Party Expense for purposes of this
Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable
efforts to provide a copy of the Company DandO Tail Policy to Purchaser and
shall provide written confirmation (provided that such written confirmation
may be in the form an e-mail) from the insurance provider that the Company DandO
Tail Policy will be bound at Closing.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, and until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company to fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company to Persons who on or prior to the
Closing Date are or were directors and/or officers of the Company (the
"Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the Charter Documents and pursuant to any indemnification agreements
between the Company and such Company Indemnified Parties that are listed on
Schedule 6.16(a) of the Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that (i) the
foregoing obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable
Laws, and (ii) no Company Indemnified Party shall have any right of
contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from Purchaser, Company,
or their respective successors with respect to any Losses claimed by any of
the Indemnified Parties against such Company Indemnified Party in his or her
capacity as a Company Indemnitor pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) If the Company (or any of its successors or assigns) (a) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (b) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person (including
by dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of creditors or
similar action), then, and in each such case, Purchaser will use commercially
reasonable efforts, which for the avoidance of doubt shall not include any
cost or expense, to cause proper provision to be made so that such other
Person fully assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.16.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.16 shall survive the Closing. This
Section 6.16 shall be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Company Indemnified Parties and his or her respective heirs,
executors, administrators, estates, successors and assigns, and each such
Person shall be an express intended third-party beneficiary of this Agreement
for such purposes.

6.17 Employee Matters.

(a) For the period of 12 months from the Closing Date, and in each case to the
extent required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall provide or shall cause to
be provided to (i) each Continuing Employee and Key Employee located outside
the United States an annual base salary (or wage level, as applicable) no less
favorable than that provided by the Company as of the Agreement Date and (ii)
to each Continuing Employee and Key Employee an annual base salary (or wage
level, as applicable) and annual cash incentive opportunity that, in the
aggregate, are at least as favorable as those provided by the Company as of
the Agreement Date.

(b) For the period of 12 months from the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees to use
reasonable efforts to ensure that all Continuing Employees shall either (i) be
eligible to continue to participate in the Company's health and welfare
benefit plans (to the same extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate under the Company's health and welfare benefit plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date) or (ii) if Purchaser or the Company terminates any
such Company health or welfare benefit plan, be eligible to participate in
Purchaser's or the Company's or a subsidiary's health and welfare benefit
plans, to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Purchaser. If
Purchaser or the Company terminates any Company health or welfare plan,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide COBRA continuation
benefits to the extent required by applicable Law to each individual who
participates in any such plan as of immediately prior to the Closing who does
not become eligible to participate in Purchaser's or the Company's or a
subsidiary's health and welfare benefit plans (whether or not such participant
is a Continuing Employee). To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility to participate in, but not for purpose of benefit accrual under,
any health or welfare benefit plan of Purchaser and/or the Company, then
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to waive all
limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would not apply under a similar Company Employee Plan in which
such employees participated prior to the Closing Date. All Continuing
Employees shall be given credit for all service with the Company or the
Subsidiary (including with a predecessor) performed at any time prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility to participate (but not vesting or
benefits accrual) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements and employment policies maintained by Purchaser in which they
become participants to the extent such service was taken into account under
the analogous Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that no such prior service shall be taken into account to the extent
it would result in the duplication of benefits to any Continuing Employee or
in violation of ERISA. Purchaser agrees to honor and maintain the Company
Employee Plan adopted by the Company pursuant to Schedule 5.2(f) of the
Disclosure Letter in accordance with its terms.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.17 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.17 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or have the
right to enforce the provisions hereof. Nothing in this Section 6.17 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee to employment with Purchaser, the Company or any other Affiliate of
the Company and the employment of each Continuing Employee who is based within
the United States shall be "at will" employment. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit the right of Purchaser to change or modify the terms
and conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee, or to amend or
terminate any employee benefit plan of Purchaser at any time.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall enter into a transition agreement
with each Transition Employee which, except as Purchaser and each such
Transition Employee may mutually agree, shall include the terms set forth on
Schedule F (each, a "Transition Agreement"). Purchaser shall deliver to each
such Transition Employee a draft of his or her Transition Agreement within 15
Business Days after the Agreement Date.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser executed settlement agreements in a
form agreed between the Company and the Purchaser from each Non-Continuing
Employee who is not a Transition Employee (it being understood that obtaining
such settlement agreements shall not be a condition to Closing).

6.18 Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units. Promptly and in any
event no later than the earlier of (i) 45 days following the Closing and (ii)
the 3-month anniversary of the Determination Date (as defined below),
Purchaser shall grant performance-vested restricted stock units covering
Parent Common Stock (each a "PSU Award") and restricted stock units covering
Parent Common Stock (each a "RSU Award") with an aggregate grant date value of
$22,000,000 (measured in reference to the Parent Stock Price) (together the
"RSU Incentive Pool" and the "PSU Incentive Pool") to certain Continuing
Employees in accordance with allocations mutually determined in writing by
Purchaser and the Company prior to the Closing (the date on which such mutual
determination is made, the "Determination Date"); provided that, in respect of
any proposed recipient of an RSU Award or a PSU Award who is subject to PAYE
in the UK, such allocation shall fall within the provisions of section 554J of
Part 7A to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. The PSU Awards and
the RSU Awards will be granted under Purchaser's 2018 Equity Incentive Plan
and pursuant to Purchaser's standard form of restricted stock unit award
agreement; provided that the PSUs Awards shall in all cases have a vesting
date which is less than 10 years from the date of grant. If an individual to
receive PSU Awards and/ or RSU Awards pursuant to the mutually agreed upon
allocations described in the foregoing sentence does not become a Continuing
Employee, or becomes a Continuing Employee and subsequently terminates
employment with Purchaser or the applicable subsidiary of Purchaser, the
portion of the PSU Incentive Pool and/ or RSU Incentive Pool allocated to such
individual will be forfeited (other than to the extent set forth in a Key
Employee Offer Letter)and Purchaser shall have no obligation to reallocate
such amount to any other Continuing Employee.

6.19 RandW Policy. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and
bind the RandW Policy at the Closing, and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in connection with such efforts.

6.20 Confirmatory Deed of Assignments of Intellectual Property: The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser on the
Closing Date, in forms agreed between the Purchaser and the Company (but which
may be based, for purposes of employees resident in the United States, on the
Company's standard form agreement): (i) an amendment to Company's Employee
Invention Assignment, Confidentiality and Non-Competition Agreement with Simon
Deng, specifying the Excluded Inventions claimed by Deng thereunder; and (ii)
executed invention assignment agreements between Company and Tim Seth.

terminated and the Acquisition abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
only:

(b) by Purchaser or the Company if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by
August 25, 2020 (the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Acquisition to occur on or before such date and
such action or failure to act constitutes breach of this Agreement;

such that the conditions set forth in Sections 2.2(b)(i) and 2.2(b)(ii) would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or inaccuracy and such breach
or inaccuracy has not been cured within 30 calendar days after written notice
thereof to the Company; provided, however, that no cure period shall be
required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy which by its nature cannot be cured or
(ii) if any of the conditions to Closing in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) for the
benefit of Purchaser are incapable of being satisfied on or before the End
Date; or

(d) by the Company or the Shareholders' Representative if it is not in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and there has been a
breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Purchaser contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Sections 2.2(c)(i) and 2.2(c)(ii) would not be satisfied as of the time of
such breach or inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured
within 30 calendar days after written notice thereof to Purchaser; provided,
however, that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy
which by its nature cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the conditions to
Closing in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(c) for the benefit of the Company are
incapable of being satisfied on or before the End Date.

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Purchaser or the Company,
or their respective officers, directors or stockholders, if applicable;
provided, however, that each party hereto and each Person shall remain liable
for any willful and intentional breaches of this Agreement, the Related
Agreements or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to
this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further, however, that,
the provisions of Sections 6.4 (Confidentiality; Public Disclosure), 6.10
(Expenses), 6.13(c) (Transfer Taxes), Article X (General Provisions) and this
Section 7.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Article VII.

ARTICLE VIII 
POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Other Indemnity Matters.

(a) Company Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in the Officer's Certificate
shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the date that is 18 months
following the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the event of fraud with
respect to a representation or warranty, such representation or warranty shall
survive indefinitely; provided, further, that (i) the Fundamental
Representations and Joinder Representations shall survive the Closing and
continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to the subject matter of such representations or
warranties and not general breach of contracts claims, and (ii) the Tax
Representations shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect until the date that is seven years following the Closing Date. The date
on which a representation or warranty expires is referred to as the
"Expiration Date," and no new claim, except for fraud (as provided above), for
a breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement may be
made after such date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival periods and termination
dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations that would otherwise
apply to such representations and warranties under applicable Law. The
expiration of any representation and warranty of the Company shall not affect
any indemnification claim for breaches of representations or warranties of the
Company with respect to the matters set forth in a corresponding written
Indemnification Claim Notice if a written Indemnification Claim Notice with
respect to such indemnification claim is delivered in accordance with Section
8.4 below prior to the Expiration Date of such representation and warranty.

(b) Purchaser Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall terminate at the
Closing Date.

(c) Covenants. The covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement (i)
that contemplate performance on or before the Closing will continue in full
force and effect after the Closing until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the date
that is 18 months following the Closing Date and (ii) that contemplate
performance after the Closing will continue in full force and effect after the
Closing in accordance with their terms until fully performed (the applicable
date of expiration of any covenant in this Agreement being a "Covenant
Termination Date"). No new claim for a breach of any covenant contained in
this Agreement may be made after the expiration of the Covenant Termination
Date of such covenant.

(d) Survival of Special Indemnities. Except for fraud, no claim for or related
to the Closing Working Capital, Closing Working Capital Adjustment, Closing
Cash or, to the extent already resolved in connection with the process set
forth in Section 1.3, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Third Party Expenses
pursuant to clause (v) of Section 8.2(a) may be made after the resolution of
the matters as set forth in Section 1.3. No claim pursuant to clauses (iv) or
(ix) of Section 8.2(a) may be made after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to such matters. No claim pursuant to
clause (viii) of Section 8.2(a) may be made after 30 calendar days after the
expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of
such matters and not general breach of contract claims (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the statute of limitations applicable to a Tax Authority
in respect of any enquiry, assessment, audit or other Action in respect of a
Pre-Closing Tax Period). No claim pursuant to clause (x) of Section 8.2(a) may
be made after the date that is seven years following the Closing Date. The
expiration of any claim period set forth in this Section 8.1(d) shall not
affect any indemnification claim with respect to the matters set forth in a
corresponding written Indemnification Claim Notice if a written
Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to such indemnification claim is
delivered in accordance with Section 8.3(h) below prior to any such expiration
date.

8.2 Indemnification.

(a) From and after and by virtue of the Acquisition, the Company Indemnitors
shall severally, and not jointly, in accordance with each Company Indemnitor's
Indemnity Pro Rata Portion, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from and
against, and covenant to pay Purchaser an amount equal to, all Losses paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained by the Purchaser and its directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents and other representatives (the "Indemnified
Parties"), or any of them (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to
any third party claims), resulting from or arising out of any of the
following:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, or failure to be true, as of the Agreement
Date or as of the Closing Date as if made as of the Closing Date (except in
the case of representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as
of a specific date or dates, in which case such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct on and as of such specified date or dates), a
representation or warranty of the Company (other than the Fundamental
Representations, the Joinder Representations or Tax Representations) contained
in this Agreement or the Related Agreements;

(ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in, or failure to be true, as of the
Agreement Date or as of the Closing Date as if made as of the Closing Date
(except in the case of representations and warranties which by their terms
speak only as of a specific date or dates, in which case such representations
and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such specified date or
dates), any Fundamental Representation, Joinder Representations or Tax
Representation;

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Related Agreements;

(iv) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Letter, (A) any inaccuracy in any information, or breach of any representation
or warranty, set forth in the Closing Spreadsheet or (B) any claim by or on
behalf of any Person that such Person is entitled to receive, in respect of
such Company Securities, any amounts in excess of the amounts indicated on the
Closing Spreadsheet in connection with the Transaction;

(v) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Letter, any Closing Third Party Expenses or Closing Indebtedness, in each
case, to the extent not included in the calculation of Total Acquisition
Consideration;

(vi) any Post-Closing Deficit owed pursuant to Section 1.3(e);

(vii) any fraud on the part of the Company or any of its Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the Related Agreements;

(viii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Letter, any Pre-Closing Taxes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such
Losses which result from or arise in connection with or in consequence of any
Tax Claim or Tax Demand in respect of such Pre-Closing Taxes) but excluding
any Losses which are attributable to Taxes which were included in the Post-
Closing Statement and actually reduced the Total Acquisition Consideration;

(ix) any claim by any current of former Company Shareholder or purported
Company Shareholder seeking the recovery of damages or other monetary relief
in connection with the Acquisition; and

(x) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Letter, the Specified Matters.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of Sections
8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(ii), the amount (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the
existence of a breach, inaccuracy or failure to be true of a representation or
warranty) of indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without regard to any
qualification based on materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or similar
qualifier contained in such representation or warranty; provided, however,
that, in no event shall (A) "Material Contract" be read to mean "Contract" or
(B) the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" be read out of Section
3.6(f)(ii). The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Other than with
respect to any claim for fraud, no Indemnified Party shall be required to show
reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in
order for such Indemnified Party to be entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under this Article VIII. Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the right of Purchaser or any other Indemnified Party to
pursue remedies under any Related Agreement (other than certificates) against
the parties thereto.

(c) This Article VIII and Section 1.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of the Indemnified Parties (as defined below) from and after the Closing Date
for recovery of Losses from a Company Indemnitor pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however, that (i) this
Section 8.2(c) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of a Company Indemnitor (and this Article VIII shall
not be the sole and exclusive remedy for such Indemnified Party) in connection
with a claim based on fraud in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions
committed by such Company Indemnitor.

8.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not recover any Losses pursuant
to an indemnification claim under Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and until the
Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained at least $1,500,000 in Losses in the aggregate (the "Deductible
Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
only those Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount that are paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties as a group.

(b) Subject to Section 8.3(e), (i) the Company Indemnitors' indemnity
obligations for Losses under Sections 8.2(a)(i), (iii)-(vi) and (ix) will be
limited, in the aggregate, to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount, plus any
interest earned thereon, less any amounts previously paid out of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund to satisfy the Losses claimed under Sections 8.2(a)(i), (iii)-(vi)
and (ix) (and for a particular Company Indemnitor, to its Indemnity Pro Rata
Portion thereof) (the "Cap"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Cap shall apply
even after the expiration of the Escrow Period.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.3, the Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive sources of recovery for indemnification claims
under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against (i) first, the RandW Policy
(if obtained), it being agreed that, if the subject matter of such
indemnification claim is expressly excluded from coverage pursuant to and as
set forth in the RandW Policy, or is a Specified Matter, the Indemnified Parties
shall have no obligation to first look to the RandW Policy for recovery of
Losses and (ii) second, if and only to the extent the Indemnified Parties are
unable to recover all or any portion of such Losses from and against the RandW
Policy or the RandW Policy is not obtained, the cash held in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund.

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8.3, the Indemnified
Parties shall be permitted to recover Losses directly from the Company
Indemnitors for indemnification claims pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(ii) through
8.2(a)(x), but only if and to the extent that such claim has not been
satisfied: (i) first, from the RandW Policy (if obtained), it being agreed that,
if the subject matter of such indemnification claim is expressly excluded from
coverage pursuant to and as set forth in the RandW Policy or is a Specified
Matter, the Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to first look to the
RandW Policy for recovery of Losses; (ii) second, if and only to the extent the
Indemnified Parties are unable to recover all or any portion of such Losses
from and against the RandW Policy or the RandW policy is not obtained, from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund; provided, however, for any Losses arising pursuant to a
breach of a Joinder Representation by a Company Indemnitor pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(ii), the Indemnified Parties may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Fund
solely up to such Company Indemnitor's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund and (iii) third, if and only to the extent the Indemnity
Escrow Fund is exhausted, directly from the Company Indemnitors; provided,
however, for any Losses arising pursuant to a breach of a Joinder
Representation by a Company Indemnitor pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(ii), the
Indemnified Parties may recover may recover Losses under this clause (iii)
solely from such Company Indemnitor. In no event shall the liability of any
Company Indemnitor for any indemnification claim under Section 8.2(a) exceed
the portion of the Acquisition Consideration actually received by such Company
Indemnitor (including any funds from the Indemnity Escrow Fund), unless such
indemnity claim is being made in respect of fraud in respect of this Agreement
and the Transactions and such Company Indemnitor committed such fraud (in
which event there shall be no limitation on the liability of such Company
Indemnitor hereunder or under applicable Law except to the extent imposed
under applicable Law). For the avoidance of doubt, but without limiting the
right of the Indemnified Parties to recover Losses from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, a
Company Indemnitor shall have no indemnity obligations for a breach of a
Joinder Representation by any other Company Indemnitor.

(e) Any amount of Losses will be calculated: (i) without regard to any
punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, or consequential damages unless (x)
any such punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, or consequential damages
are actually awarded by a court to a third party (provided that all such
anticipated Losses may be preliminarily included by an Indemnified Party in an
Indemnification Claim Notice), and (y) in the case of special, incidental or
consequential damages only, any such special or consequential damages would
have been reasonably foreseeable; (ii) such that costs and expenses incurred
in investigating, defending or resolving any applicable claim under this
Article VIII shall constitute Losses if and solely to the extent that such
underlying claim is indemnifiable hereunder; (iii) with respect to Losses
incurred in respect of any representation in Section 3.7, only to the extent
such Losses were not included in the Post-Closing Statement; and (iv) in a
manner that takes into account Purchaser's Proportion, such that the Company
Indemnitors shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Party in respect
of any Loss for which Purchaser would otherwise have been responsible
hereunder if it were a Company Indemnitor on the basis of the Purchaser's
Proportion.

(f) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments or reimbursements actually received by the
Indemnified Parties from third parties (other than the Company Indemnitors) in
respect of such Losses (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such insurance (other than the RandW Policy), indemnification or reimbursement,
including any increases in insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments
resulting from such recovery). In the event that an insurance recovery is
received by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which any
such Person has been indemnified and which Losses such Person had received
from the Company Indemnitors hereunder, then a refund equal to the lesser of
the amount received from the Company Indemnitors in respect of such Losses and
the aggregate amount of the recovery (except in the case of the RandW Policy,
net of costs and expenses incurred in recovering such amounts, Taxes payable
by any Indemnified Party in respect of such amounts, and any resulting
insurance premiums with respect to insurance policies) payable in respect of
(i) Employee Company Options shall be paid to the Company for further payment
to such holders of Employee Company Options through the Company's payroll
processing system net of applicable Tax withholding and deductions (including,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, secondary class 1 (employer's)
National Insurance contributions and any equivalent Tax in any other
jurisdiction) and (ii) Non-Employee Company Options, Company Capital Shares
and Company Warrants shall be made to the Payment Agent for distribution to
the applicable Company Indemnitors, in each case, in accordance with each such
Company Indemnitor's respective Indemnity Pro Rata Portion. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require Purchaser or any Indemnified Party to seek recovery of
Losses under an insurance policy, except with respect to the RandW Policy (if
obtained) as set forth in this Section 8.3.

(g) Any Losses for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, or being indemnifiable pursuant to more than one clause of Section
8.2(a).

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company
Indemnitors shall not be liable for a Tax Liability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of a Tax Claim (other than a Tax Liability within
limbs (ix), (x)or (xi) of the definition of Pre-Closing Taxes) to the extent
that:

(i) it results from any Tax election made with respect to the Acquisition or
made by the Purchaser after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period;

(ii) it results directly from a voluntary act of the Company or the Subsidiary
after Closing outside the ordinary course of the business of the Company or
the Subsidiary, as the case may be, as carried on immediately prior to Closing
and which act the Company or the Subsidiary (as applicable) was aware, or
ought reasonably have been aware, would give rise to such Tax Liability save
where such act is:

(A) pursuant to a legally binding obligation of the Company or the Subsidiary
entered into prior to Closing;

(B) in fulfilment of a legally binding obligation contemplated by this
Agreement;

(C) at the written request of any of the Company Indemnitors;

(D) pursuant to an obligation imposed on the Company, the Subsidiary or any
member of the Purchaser's Tax Group by any law, regulation or directive or the
published practice of any Tax Authority; or

(E) necessary to comply with any decision of any court or tribunal;

provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any voluntary disclosure to or
filing or other communication with any Tax Authority shall not be a
transaction or voluntary act to which this Section 8.3(h)(ii) applies where
such disclosure or filing (1) is required by applicable Law or published Tax
Authority guidance or (2) in the reasonable opinion of the Purchaser after
having taken advice from an external tax advisor, is necessary in order to
prevent the imposition of penalties on the Company (or reduce an amount of
penalties imposed);

(iii) it arises or is increased as a result of any change in the date to which
the Company or any Subsidiary makes up its accounts, or any change in the
bases, methods or policies of accounting of the Company or any Subsidiary in
each case where the change was made on or after Closing, other than to comply
with generally accepted accounting practice at or prior to the Closing Date;

(iv) it arises or is increased by reason of any change in Tax legislation
(including the imposition of Tax) or of an increase in the rates of Tax as a
consequence of any change in law, regulation, published interpretation or
published practice of a Tax Authority or the withdrawal of any previously
published interpretation, practice or concession of a Tax Authority, in each
case announced and implemented after Closing with retrospective effect, and
other than a change introduced to target Tax avoidance;

(v) the Purchaser has been compensated for the Tax Liability in question at no
Loss to the Company, the Subsidiaries or any member of the Purchaser's Tax
Group;

(vi) it would not have arisen but for a failure or omission of the Company or
any Subsidiary to make any proper claim, election, surrender or disclaimer or
to give any notice or consent or do any other thing after Closing the making,
giving or doing of which was taken into account in computing the provision for
Tax in the Post-Closing Statement and the details of which the Purchaser was
aware or ought reasonably to have been aware;

(vii) any Relief (other than a Purchaser's Relief) is available to the Company
or any Subsidiary to set against or otherwise mitigate the Tax Liability;

(viii) it would not have arisen but for the cessation of trade or the winding
up of the Company or any Subsidiary, or a major change in the nature or
conduct of the trade of the Company or any Subsidiary, which, in any such
case, occurs after Closing;

(ix) it is a liability to interest or penalties: (A) arising as a result of
the failure to duly prepare and timely submit the Purchaser Prepared Returns
after Closing, unless, in the case of a failure to submit on a proper basis,
such failure arises as a result of any default by the Selling Shareholders,
the Company or any Subsidiary prior to Closing, or a failure of the
Shareholders' Representative to comply with its obligations under Section
6.13(a); or (B) which would not have arisen but for the failure by the Company
or any Subsidiary to make payment to the relevant Tax Authority of an amount
of Tax equal to the payment made by the Company Indemnitors in respect of such
Tax under this Agreement by the due date for payment where the payment from
the Company Indemnity was received by the Purchaser at least five Business
Days prior to the due date for payment of such Tax.

8.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VIII,
including for a Third Party Claim (as defined below) such Indemnified Party
shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") to the
Shareholders' Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow
Period has not expired) (or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue
such indemnification claim directly against an Company Indemnitor, to such
Company Indemnitor directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay,
incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) describing (A) the amount of claimed
Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent known and reasonably quantifiable
by Purchaser), and (B) the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if
applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. Purchaser may update an
Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in
circumstances following the date thereof.

(b) If the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnitors
(or the Company Indemnitor in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Company Indemnitor) shall not object in writing
within the thirty day period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice
by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a reasonably detailed
description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to the
applicable indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
the Shareholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnitors (or the
applicable Company Indemnitor) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the
full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim
Notice. In such event, Purchaser and the Shareholders' Representative shall
promptly (but in any event within three Business Days of the resolution of
such Indemnification Claim Notice) deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to immediately release to Purchaser from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

(c) In the event that the Shareholders' Representative shall timely deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (or
in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Company Indemnitor, if such Company Indemnitor shall object to any claim or
claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover claims directly
from such Company Indemnitor within thirty days after delivery of such
Indemnification Claim Notice), the Shareholders' Representative (or such
objecting Company Indemnitor) and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Shareholders' Representative (or such objecting Company
Indemnitor) and Purchaser should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof. In such event, the
Escrow Agent shall promptly release to Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the amount held in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount to be paid to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum, then, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VIII, each Company Indemnitor shall,
within 20 Business Days following the date of such memorandum, pay to the
Indemnified Party, such Company Indemnitor's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of
such shortfall in cash.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to 30 calendar days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, Purchaser or the Shareholders' Representative (or the applicable
Company Indemnitor) may pursue binding arbitration administered by the
American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration
Rules with the venue of such arbitration being in San Francisco, and judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.

8.5 Third Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware
of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Indemnified Party
reasonably believes may result in a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Shareholders' Representative
of such claim with an Indemnification Claim Notice (a "Third Party Notice"),
and shall provide a copy of such Third Party Notice to the Escrow Agent, if
the Escrow Period has not expired and funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund, and the Third Party Notice shall be accompanied by copies of any
documentation submitted by the third party making such Third Party Claim, if
any; provided, that no delay or failure on the part of Purchaser in delivering
a Third Party Notice shall cause any Indemnified Party to forfeit any
indemnification rights under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Company Indemnitors are actually and materially prejudiced by such delay or
failure. Upon receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Shareholders'
Representative shall be entitled (on behalf of the Company Indemnitors and at
their expense), or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
from fewer than all the Company Indemnitors, the applicable Company
Indemnitors shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate in (but not to
control, determine or conduct) the defense of such Third Party Claim.
Purchaser shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense
of, and to settle, any such claim and the Shareholders' Representative (or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder from fewer than all the
Company Indemnitors, such applicable Company Indemnitor) shall not be entitled
to control any negotiation of settlement, adjustment or compromise with
respect to any such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that except with the
consent of the Shareholders' Representative, no settlement of any such Third
Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of the existence
or amount of Losses relating to such matter; provided further, however, that
the consent of the Shareholders' Representative with respect to any settlement
of any such Third Party Claim shall be deemed to have been given unless the
Shareholders' Representative shall have objected within 20 days after a
written request for such consent by Purchaser. In the event that the
Shareholders' Representative has consented to any such settlement, adjustment
or compromise, the Company Indemnitors or the consenting Company Indemnitors,
as applicable, shall have no power or authority to object under any provision
of this Article VIII to the amount of such settlement, adjustment or
compromise.

8.6 Overprovisions.

(a) If any provision for Tax (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any
provision for deferred tax) in the Post-Closing Statement proves to be an over
provision, then an amount equal to such overprovision ("Relevant Amount")
shall be dealt with in accordance with Section 8.6(b), provided that no
account shall be taken of any overprovision or understatement to the extent
that it arises as a result of an Event including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the utilization of a Purchaser's Relief, or a voluntary act or omission of the
Purchaser) or change of law or accounting practice occurring after Closing or
otherwise to the extent that such amount reduces an amount claimed or
claimable under the RandW Policy.

(b) Where it is provided under Section 8.6(a) that a Relevant Amount is to be
dealt with in accordance with this Section 8.6(b):

(i) the Relevant Amount shall first be set off against any payment then due
from the Company Indemnitors under this Agreement; and

(ii) to the extent there is any excess after the application of Section
8.6(b)(i), such excess shall be carried forward and set off against any future
payment or payments which become due from the Company Indemnitors under this
Agreement.

(c) The Company Indemnitors may at their own expense require the auditors for
the time being of the Company to certify the existence and quantum of any
Relevant Amount and, in the absence of manifest error, their decision shall be
final and binding.

ARTICLE IX 
SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

9.1 Appointment and Authority of Shareholders' Representative.

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or a Joinder
Agreement, as applicable, each of the Participating Sellers shall be deemed to
have agreed to appoint Fortis Advisors LLC as his, her or its exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact, as the Shareholders' Representative under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and the Shareholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement for and on behalf of the Participating Sellers to give
and receive notices and communications in respect of indemnification claims
under this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any of the transactions and
other matters contemplated hereby and thereby, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Party from the Working Capital Escrow Fund or Indemnity Escrow
Fund in satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder by any
Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with
orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any such
indemnification claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any such indemnification claim by any
Indemnified Party hereunder against any Participating Seller or Company
Indemnitor or by any such Participating Seller or Company Indemnitor against
any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any such Indemnified Party and
any such Participating Seller or Company Indemnitor, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders'
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and the
Shareholders' Representative Engagement Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Shareholders' Representative shall have no obligation to act on
behalf of the Participating Sellers or Company Indemnitors, except as
expressly provided herein, in the Escrow Agreements and in the Shareholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of the Shareholders' Representative in any ancillary agreement,
schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Letter. The Shareholders' Representative
may resign at any time and such agency may be changed by the Participating
Sellers from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to
Purchaser; provided, however, that in no case shall the Shareholders'
Representative be a Key Employee or any other current or former Employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, and provided further that the Shareholders'
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority in interest of
the Indemnity Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive
the resignation or removal of the Shareholders' Representative or any member
of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the
position of Shareholders' Representative may be filled by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required
of the Shareholders' Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Participating Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event may the
Shareholders' Representative take any action which would increase the
liabilities or obligations of any Participating Sellers beyond what is
contemplated by this Agreement or any Related Agreement, without the prior
written consent of such Participating Sellers.

(b) Exculpation and Indemnification of Company Shareholders' Representative.
Certain Participating Sellers and Company Indemnitors have entered into an
engagement agreement (the "Shareholders' Representative Engagement Agreement")
with the Shareholders' Representative to provide direction to the
Shareholders' Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and the Shareholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement (such Participating Sellers and Company Indemnitors,
including their individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred
to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the Shareholders' Representative nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Shareholders'
Representative Group"), shall be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder,
under the Escrow Agreements or under the Shareholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement as Shareholders' Representative while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Participating Sellers
and Company Indemnitors on whose behalf the Escrow Amounts were contributed to
the Escrow Funds shall jointly and severally indemnify and defend the
Shareholders' Representative Group and hold the Shareholders' Representative
Group harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damage, fee, cost,
judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders' Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Shareholders' Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel or other skilled professionals retained by
the Shareholders' Representative and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers (collectively the "Shareholders' Representative Expenses"). The
Shareholders' Representative shall have the right to recover Shareholders'
Representative Expenses first, from the Expense Cash, second, from the funds
then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, if any, prior to any distribution
to the Company Indemnitors, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Shareholders'
Representative Expenses actually incurred, and third, directly from the
Participating Sellers and Company Indemnitors. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders' Representative, including an amendment,
extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section
10.4, shall constitute a decision of the Company Indemnitors and shall be
final, conclusive and binding upon the Company Indemnitors and their
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by the Company
Indemnitors, and all defenses which may be available to any Company Indemnitor
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Shareholders' Representative
taken in good faith under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreements or the
Shareholders' Representative Engagement Agreement are waived. The Escrow Agent
and Purchaser may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Shareholders' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Company Indemnitors. The Escrow Agent and Purchaser are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders' Representative.

(c) Expense Cash.The Expense Cash shall be deposited with the Shareholders'
Representative, to constitute an expense fund (the "Expense Fund") and to be
governed by the provisions set forth herein. The Expense Cash shall be used
(i) to reimburse the Shareholders' Representative for any Shareholders'
Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred by the Shareholders'
Representative, or to satisfy any claims against the Working Capital Escrow or
Company Indemnitors hereunder if the Shareholders' Representative shall
determine there are sufficient funds for such purpose, or (ii) as otherwise
directed by the Advisory Group, and shall be released to the Participating
Sellers and the Shareholders' Representative, as the case may be, pursuant to
the terms of this Section 9.1. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Shareholders' Representative that the Expense Cash is no longer required to be
withheld, the Shareholders' Representative shall deposit the remaining balance
of the Expense Cash (if any) with the Payment Agent for further distribution
to the Participating Sellers in proportion to their respective Working Capital
Pro Rata Portions; provided, that, if there are any pending but unresolved
indemnification claims of any Indemnified Parties, then all amounts shall
remain in escrow and remain available for release to the Shareholders'
Representative until all indemnification claims have been finally resolved and
the Shareholders' Representative has been reimbursed in full for all
Shareholders' Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred and
thereafter any remaining Expense Cash shall be released to the respective
Participating Sellers (by the Company or the Payment Agent, as applicable) in
proportion to their respective Working Capital Pro Rata Portions. In the event
such Shareholders' Representative Expenses exceed the remaining amount of
Expense Cash, the Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to recover
such expenses following the expiration of each Escrow Period from the Escrow
Amounts otherwise distributable to or for the benefit of the Participating
Sellers or Company Indemnitors, as applicable, only at the time of
distribution of such amounts (and not distributed or distributable to an
Indemnified Party or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an
Indemnified Party) pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow Agreement,
or directly from the Participating Sellers and Company Indemnitors if the
Escrow Amounts are insufficient to reimburse the Shareholders' Representative
for such Shareholders' Representative Expenses, and such recovery will be made
from the Participating Sellers or Company Indemnitors, applicable, according
to their respective Pro Rata Portions. No provision of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement shall require the Shareholders' Representative to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise
or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreements, the Shareholders' Representative Engagement
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Shareholders' Representative shall not be required to take any action unless
the Shareholders' Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Shareholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Shareholders' Representative in performing such
actions. For clarity, no Indemnified Party shall have any liability with
respect to the Expense Cash, including with respect to the distribution,
investment, holding and disposition thereof.

(i) The Shareholders' Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Cash other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Shareholders'
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity
in connection with the Expense Cash, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Participating Sellers will not receive any
interest on the Expense Cash and assign to the Shareholders' Representative
any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Shareholders'
Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Cash from any consideration
otherwise distributable to the Participating Sellers.

(ii) For income Tax purposes, the Expense Cash shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Participating Sellers on the Closing
Date, and any Tax withholding required with respect to a Participating
Seller's deemed receipt of its Working Capital Pro Rata Portion of the Expense
Cash on the Closing Date shall be satisfied from such Participating Seller's
share of Total Acquisition Consideration received at Closing pursuant to
Section 2.3(b)(i).

(d) The Shareholders' Representative shall be entitled to the reasonable
assistance of the Company's former officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder; provided, that, the
Shareholders' Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or
about the Company to anyone (except to the Participating Sellers' or the
Shareholders' Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors or authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case
who agree to treat such information confidentially); provided, however, that
neither Purchaser nor the Company shall be obligated to provide such access or
information if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege. The Shareholders'
Representative shall enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement
prior to being provided access to such information if requested by Purchaser.

(e) The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Shareholders' Representative hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Participating Seller and shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Participating Seller (so entitled) of the whole or any fraction of his, her or
its interest in the Escrow Funds. The Shareholders' Representative shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Closing Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable
Participating Seller or other party.

(f) Each Participating Seller (so entitled), by acceptance of consideration
under this Agreement and/or completion and execution of a Letter of
Transmittal, acknowledges and accepts the terms and conditions set forth in
that certain engagement letter dated as of the Agreement Date, by and among
certain Participating Sellers (constituting in excess of a majority of the
Company Capital Shares) named therein and the Shareholders' Representative.

ultimately liable for all of Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

10.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as

threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Company
Shareholder or the Shareholders' Representative of any covenant, obligation or
other agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled,

this Agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at Law or in
equity against a Person based on such Person's fraud in respect of this
Agreement or the Transactions, nor will any such provisions limit, or be
deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such
claim for fraud in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) the
time period during which a claim for fraud in respect of this Agreement or the
Transactions may be brought or (iii) the recourse which any such party may

hereto, the Disclosure Letter, the Related Agreements, and the documents and
instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein
constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the

understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, and are not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

10.11 Privilege. Purchaser and the Company hereby agree that all privileged
communications prior to the Closing between the Company's securityholders, the
Shareholders' Representative, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, managers, officers, employees or representatives, on
the one hand, and Fenwick and West LLP ("Fenwick"), on the other hand, made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing
under this Agreement or any agreement entered into pursuant to this Agreement,
or otherwise relating to the foregoing or any potential sale of the Company,
shall be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications of the
Company Security Holders and the Shareholders' Representative, and the control
of the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto shall be retained by
the Company Security Holders and the Shareholders' Representative and all
other communications prior to the Closing between such Persons, any third
parties and Fenwick shall be deemed to be the confidential communications of
the Company Security Holders and the Shareholders' Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a Person other than a party to this Agreement or its Affiliates, on the
other hand, after the Closing, Purchaser, the Company and any of their
respective Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such third-party of such privileged communications; provided
that none of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Shareholders'
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

10.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in
DocuSign and/or .PDF format shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

10.13 Parent Guaranty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent
undertakes to cause Purchaser to timely meet, and guarantees the performance
of, all of Purchaser's obligations herein and in each Related Agreement and to
the extent Purchaser does not timely meet any obligation herein or in any such
Related Agreement (including any payment obligations) Parent shall directly
perform such obligation on behalf of Purchaser. This guaranty shall be a
guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, and Parent hereby
agrees that its obligation hereunder shall be primary and unconditional (and
not as a surety), subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. To the extent Parent is called upon to perform any such obligation
on behalf of Purchaser, Parent shall have all of the rights that Purchaser
would have had Purchaser performed such obligation directly.

local Law with respect to income of the Company or any Subsidiaries, incurred
on or prior to the Closing; 

and for this purpose, in the case of Taxes based on income, sales, proceeds,
profits, receipts, wages, compensation or similar items and all other Taxes
that are not imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of such Taxes that have

end of the day on the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the books
(and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the ownership by the Company of
any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough" entity or
