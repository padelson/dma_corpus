 Section 2.05 _. Assignment of Contracts and Rights._ (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such assignment, with or without the consent, approval or waiver of, or notice to, a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of such Purchased Asset or violation of any Applicable Law or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer (or its designated Affiliate(s)) or Seller (or an Affiliate of Seller) thereunder unless and until any required consent, approval or waiver is obtained. Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts (including the dedication of resources thereto, but without any obligation to expend money, commence litigation or offer or grant any financial or other accommodation to any third party) to obtain the consent, approval or waiver of, or provide the required notice to, such third parties to or of the assignment to Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)) of any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or otherwise transfer the rights and benefits of any Non-assignable Asset (as defined below) to Buyer or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate, including, in the case of any non-transferable Permits, to cause the applicable Governmental Authority to issue a new Permit to Buyer or its Affiliate in place of such non-transferable Permit and with respect to prime Government Contracts, to obtain all necessary approval and consent of the applicable U.S. federal Governmental Authority to novate such prime Government Contracts in accordance with FAR Subpart 42.12. If such consent, approval or waiver is not obtained, or such notice is not made, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates thereunder so that Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)) would not in fact receive all such rights, or if such asset is not transferable under Applicable Law with or without such consent, approval, waiver or notice (any assets so described, the "Non-assignable Assets"), Seller and Buyer will use their commercially reasonable efforts (but without any obligation to expend money, commence litigation or offer or grant any financial or other accommodation to any third party) to enter into a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would assume the obligations and Seller would provide to Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)) the benefits of any Non-assignable Asset, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)), and with respect to the prime Government Contracts, entering into and taking commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required approvals or consents of any U.S. federal Governmental Authority to the Subcontract prior to the Closing Date), or under which Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)), with Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate(s)) assuming Sellers (or such Affiliates) obligations under such Non-assignable Asset, any and all rights of Seller or such Affiliate against a third party thereto. In connection with any such arrangement, Buyer shall reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the performance of any mutually 

   ##### 

  

    

agreeable arrangement or that otherwise would have been incurred by Buyer or
its Affiliates had such Non-assignable Asset been assigned, transferred or
conveyed as contemplated by this Agreement, including any Liability arising
out of Buyers failure to perform thereunder (such costs and expenses, the
"Alternative Arrangement Costs"). Prior to the amount of the
deductible described in clause (B) of Section 11.02(a) being exceeded
(whether pursuant to reimbursement under this sentence or pursuant to any
other provision of this Agreement or a combination of the foregoing), Buyer
will promptly reimburse Seller for all out-of pocket costs and expenses
actually incurred by Seller or its Affiliates (other than Alternative
Arrangement Costs) relating to or arising from the failure to obtain a
consent, approval or waiver for any Non-assignable Assets (such costs and
expenses, the "Other Consent Costs") and any such reimbursement shall be
applied toward such deductible. After the amount of such deductible has been
exceeded, Buyer will promptly reimburse Seller for 50% of Other Consent
Costs. Seller will promptly pay to Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its
designated Affiliate(s)) when received all monies received by Seller or
an Affiliate of Seller under any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an
Excluded Asset. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including anything in the foregoing Section 2.05(a)), with respect to the Transferred Software set forth on Schedule 1.01(a)(v), (i) if requested by Buyer in writing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek the Consent of any third party required to transfer such Transferred Software to Buyer; _provided_ that in no event shall Seller be required to (w) expend money, (x) commence any litigation, (y) offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in order to obtain such Consent or (z) diminish any rights of the Seller or its Affiliates in the Transferred Software (other than a reduction in the number of seat or user licenses); and (ii) if Seller is unable to obtain any Consent in accordance with clause (i) required to transfer any Transferred Software, Seller shall have no further obligation to Buyer under the Agreement or otherwise with respect to the transfer of such Transferred Software, except as contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement. In the event the Transferred Software is transferred to Buyer, Buyer shall be responsible for any obligations with respect to such Transferred Software after the date of such transfer. 

  

 Section 2.06 _. Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price._ (a) The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the "Purchase Price") is equal to $675,000,000 in cash. The Purchase Price shall be paid as provided in Section 2.07 and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.08. Seller shall be treated as receiving a portion of the Purchase Price as agent for any of its Affiliates actually selling, transferring or conveying the Purchased Assets, consistent with the allocation of the Purchase Price pursuant to the Allocation Statement, and Buyers payment of the Purchase Price to Seller shall constitute payment by Buyer to any of Sellers Affiliates actually selling, transferring or conveying the Purchased Assets hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Within 60 days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation Statement") allocating the Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities and transaction costs, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. If, within five Business Days after delivery of the Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days. In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within 20 days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain KPMG LLP (the "Accounting Referee") to resolve the disputed items in the manner described in Section 8.10. 

  

 (c) Each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 2.06(e), (ii) act in accordance with, and cause its Affiliates to act in accordance with, the Allocation Statement in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax Return (including filing IRS Form 8594 with its federal Income Tax Return for the taxable year that includes the Closing) and (iii) take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the allocation reflected on the Allocation Statement on any Tax Return, in any Contest or otherwise, unless required by a Final Determination.

   ##### 

  

    

waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article 10 (other than those conditions
that by their nature may only be satisfied at the Closing and will in fact be
satisfied at the Closing), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller
may agree; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Closing may be delayed by Seller
(x) for up to one month if the Tax Opinion has not been finalized by such

applicable fiscal month. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to delay the Closing under either (x) or (y)
of the immediately preceding sentence if Seller would otherwise be obligated
to complete the Closing between June 26, 2009 and July 3, 2009 (inclusive). If
Seller exercises its right to delay the Closing as set forth in the second
immediately preceding sentence, Seller shall deliver 5 Business Days notice
to Buyer of Sellers intent to close. The Closing shall be deemed to be
effective for accounting and other computational purposes, and the
parties will treat the Closing as if it had occurred, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern
Time on the Closing Date. All proceedings to be taken, and all documents to
be executed and delivered by all parties at the Closing, shall be deemed to
have been taken and executed simultaneously, and no proceedings shall be
deemed to have been taken and no documents shall be deemed to have been
executed or delivered until all have been taken, executed and delivered. At
the Closing: 

  

 (a) Buyer shall deliver (or, subject to Section 13.05, cause one or more of its designated Affiliates to deliver) to Seller the Purchase Price in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller with a bank in New York City designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 (b) Seller shall deliver or cause its Affiliates to deliver, as applicable, to Buyer such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, assignments, duly endorsed certificates, stock powers and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as reasonably necessary or appropriate to vest in Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate) all right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets other than the Irish Purchased Assets. 

  

 (c) Seller shall deliver or cause its Affiliates to deliver, as applicable, to Buyer such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, assignments, duly endorsed certificates, stock powers and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as reasonably necessary or appropriate to vest in Buyer (or, subject to Section 13.05, its designated Affiliate) all right, title and interest in, to and under the Irish Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 2.10. 

  

 (d) Seller and Buyer shall enter into or cause their respective Affiliates, as applicable, to enter into the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement), and Seller and Buyer shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each other their respective duly executed counterparts of each of the Transaction 

   #####

 Section 2.08 _. Closing Balance Sheet; Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer for its review a statement (the "Closing Statement") of the Closing Working Capital and the Closing Cash as of the close of business on the Closing Date. "Closing Working Capital" means, as of the Closing, the current assets of the Business (excluding Closing Cash, State of Florida deferred costs phases 3,4,5 (recorded in SAP account number 1308015) and deferred Income Tax assets but including the long-term portion of any unbilled revenues or unbilled receivables) less the current liabilities of the Business (excluding all State of Florida deferred revenue liabilities (including SAP account numbers 2308010, 2308015 and 2308025), P7200 rework and related liabilities, deferred Income Tax liabilities and, for the avoidance of doubt, accrued Income Tax liabilities), in each case included in the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities or owned or owing by the Subsidiary, taken as a whole. Closing Working Capital and Closing Cash will be determined in a manner consistent with the policies, principles, practices and methodologies set forth on _Exhibit D_ (the "Agreed Principles"). The calculation of the target closing working capital is set forth in _Exhibit E_. Buyer shall give Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to the premises, books and records, and appropriate personnel of the Business as necessary for purposes of the preparation of the Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.08(a) (and during the periods contemplated by Section 2.08(b)). Buyer shall instruct its employees (including the Transferred Employees) and Representatives to cooperate with, and promptly and completely respond to all reasonable requests and inquiries of, Seller and its Representatives, and, upon execution of a customary access letter if required by Buyers outside accountants, Seller and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Buyer or its Representatives (including its outside accountants) to the extent such materials have been prepared by Buyer and its Representatives and relate to the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash and are reasonably required by Seller or its Representatives in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Cash. At the Businesss facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia, Cork, Ireland, and additional locations which would reasonably be deemed necessary to achieve at 

   ##### 

  

    

least 75% coverage of total inventory of the Business, whether raw materials,
work-in-process or finished product (the "Inventory"), Seller will determine
the quantities of Inventory located at such facilities as of the Closing Date
for purposes of the Closing Working Capital calculation by taking a physical
count or measurement of the Inventory located at such facilities commencing
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date. During such
physical count or measurement, Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that incoming shipments of materials from suppliers and
shipments to customers do not affect such physical counts or measurements.
Seller will conduct such physical counts or measurements of the Inventory
using Business Employees and/or contractors. For finished product Inventory
in transit to customers on the Closing Date, the physical count or
measurement will exclude the invoiced quantities in transit to customers
as supported by shipping records. Buyer will have the right to have its
Representatives observe and check such physical inventory count or
measurement. 

  

 (b) Buyer and its Representatives may make reasonable inquiries of Seller and/or its Representatives regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of Buyers review. Seller shall give Buyer reasonable access to the premises, books and records, and its Representatives for purposes of reviewing the Closing Statement in accordance with this Section 2.08(b). Seller shall instruct its employees and Representatives and cause its Affiliates to instruct their respective employees and Representatives to cooperate with, and promptly and completely respond to all reasonable requests and inquiries of, Buyer and its Representatives, and, upon execution of a customary access letter if required by Sellers outside accountants, Buyer and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by Seller or its Representatives (including its outside accountants) to the extent such materials relate to the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash and are reasonably required by Buyer or its Representatives in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Cash. Buyer shall complete its review of the Closing Statement within forty-five (45) days after the delivery thereof to Buyer. Promptly following completion of its review (but in no event later than the conclusion of the forty-five (45) day period), Buyer may submit to Seller a letter regarding its concurrence or disagreement with the accuracy of the Closing Statement; _provided_ that any such letter must specify (i) the items of the Closing Statement with which Buyer disagrees, (ii) the adjustments that Buyer proposes to be made to the Closing Statement and (iii) the specific amount of such disagreement and reasonable supporting documentation and calculations and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Buyer may only disagree with the Closing Statement if Buyers proposed calculation will result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price. If Buyer does not deliver a letter disagreeing with the accuracy of the Closing Statement before the conclusion of such forty-five (45) day period, the Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Closing Statement. If Buyer does deliver such a letter, following such delivery, 

   ##### 

  

    

Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve promptly any
disagreement as to the computation of any item in the Closing Statement. Any
items to which there is no disagreement shall be deemed agreed. If a
resolution of such disagreement has not been effected within fifteen (15)
days (or longer, as mutually agreed by the parties) after delivery of such
letter, notwithstanding the parties good faith efforts to resolve the
disagreement, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly engage the Accounting
Referee to resolve on a basis consistent with the Agreed Principles such
disagreement regarding the Closing Statement (a "Disputed Item"). Each party
shall cooperate with and make available to the other party and the Accounting
Referee all information, records, data and working papers as may be
reasonably requested by the Accounting Referee in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Closing Statement and the resolution of
any disagreements relating thereto and shall cause the Accounting Referee to
render its determination with respect to any Disputed Item within thirty (30)
days of submission of such Disputed Item to the Accounting Referee. The
Accounting Referee shall adopt a position within the range of positions
submitted by Seller and Buyer with respect to any Disputed Item. The
Accounting Referees determination regarding any Disputed Item shall be based
solely on whether Seller included such Disputed Item in or excluded such
Disputed Item from the Closing Statement or calculated such Disputed Item, as
the case may be, in a manner consistent with the Agreed Principles. All
determinations made by the Accounting Referee shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties hereto, and neither of the parties hereto, nor any
of their respective Affiliates, shall seek recourse in the courts or other
tribunals, other than to enforce the Accounting Referees determination.
Subject to Section 13.07, judgment may be entered to enforce such
determination in any court of competent jurisdiction. Closing Working Capital
as finally determined in accordance herewith shall be referred to as the
"Final Closing Working Capital." The Closing Cash as finally determined in
accordance herewith shall be referred to as the "Closing Cash Amount." The
fees, costs, and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be shared as
follows: 

   

 (i) if the Accounting Referee resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Buyers position (the Final Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may be, so determined is referred to herein as the "Low Value"), then Seller shall be obligated to pay for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee; 

   

 (ii) if the Accounting Referee resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Sellers position (the Final Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Cash Amount, as the case may be, so determined is referred to herein as the "High Value"), then Buyer shall be obligated to pay for all of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee; and 

   

 (iii) if the Accounting Referee neither resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Buyers position nor resolves all of the Disputed Items in favor of Sellers position (the Final Closing Working 

   ##### 

  

    

Capital and/or the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may be, so determined is
referred to herein as the "Actual Value"), Seller shall be responsible for
such fraction of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee for the
Final Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may
be, equal to (x) the difference between the High Value and the Actual Value
over (y) the difference between the High Value and the Low Value, for the
Final Closing Working Capital and/or the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may
be, and Buyer shall be responsible for the remainder of the fees and expenses
of the Accounting Referee. 

  

 (c) If the Final Closing Working Capital: 

   

 (i) is equal to or greater than an amount three percent (3%) below the target closing working capital set forth on _Exhibit E_ (the "Lower Working Capital Limit") and is equal to or less than an amount three percent (3%) above the target closing working capital set forth on _Exhibit E_ (the "Upper Working Capital Limit"), then no adjustments will be made to the Purchase Price in respect of the Final Closing Working Capital; 

   

 (ii) exceeds the Upper Working Capital Limit, then Buyer shall be obligated to pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Closing Working Capital exceeds the Upper Working Capital Limit; or 

   

 (iii) is less than the Lower Working Capital Limit, then Seller shall be obligated to repay to Buyer the amount by which the Lower Working Capital Limit exceeds the Final Closing Working Capital. 

  

 (d) Buyer shall be obligated to pay to Seller the Closing Cash Amount, if any. 

  

 (e) Any payments to be made pursuant to Sections 2.08(c) and 2.08(d) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing Working Capital and the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, if either of the Final Closing Working Capital or the Closing Cash Amount, as the case may be, is determined before the other, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall pay the other party any amount owed pursuant to Section 2.08(c) or 2.08(d) in respect of such determination within five (5) Business Days after such determination (notwithstanding that the other has not yet been determined). Any payment made pursuant to Section 2.08(c) or 2.08(d) shall be made with interest (such interest to be calculated on the actual number of days elapsed) on such amount from (i) the date of the delivery of a letter of disagreement, if there is a disagreement or (ii) 35 days from the Closing if there is no such letter of 

   ##### 

  

    

disagreement (or if the Closing Statement has not yet been delivered by
Seller), to the date of such payment at a rate equal to six percent (6%) per
annum. 

  

 Section 2.09. _GST and QST Elections_. At the Closing, Seller and Buyer (or their respective Affiliates) shall jointly execute an election under section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and an election under section 75 of an Act respecting the Quebec sales tax (Quebec) in the prescribed form, such that no GST or QST shall be payable in connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer shall file the joint elections with the returns required to be filed by Buyer under the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and an Act respecting the Quebec sales tax (Quebec) for the Buyers reporting periods in which the sale was made, in compliance with the requirements of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and an Act respecting the Quebec sales tax (Quebec). 

  

 Section 2.10. _Irish Purchased Assets._ Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not convey title to any of the Irish Purchased Assets. Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, in relation to the Irish Purchased Assets, appropriate documentation is entered into on the Closing Date to convey title to the Irish Purchased Assets so as to mitigate Irish Stamp Duty.

 (ii) through the acquisition of an interest in any Person (whether by merger, stock purchase, investment or otherwise) or through the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of any Person (each, an "Acquisition Transaction"), in each case after the date hereof, which Person immediately prior to the time of such Acquisition Transaction derives 5% or less of its annual revenue from the Restricted Business; and

 (d) Seller hereby acknowledges that the covenants in this Section 5.04 are adequately supported by consideration from Buyer given pursuant to this Agreement and other Transaction Documents.

In the case of any Specified Policy that is a "claims made basis" policy, from the Closing Date until the policy expiration date (including any renewal thereof) of such policy, and in the case of any Specified Policy that is an "occurrence basis" policy, after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to assert claims for any loss, liability or damage suffered with respect to any Purchased Assets after the Closing with respect to any incident or event to the extent occurring, existing or arising prior to the Closing, but only to the extent such loss, liability or damage is covered by the terms of such Specified Policy; _provided_ that Seller shall not be required to pay any amount to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.06 unless and until it has received payment associated with claims under such Specified Policies (net of any applicable deductibles or other out-of-pocket costs and expenses directly related to such claims). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in connection with making such claim and shall provide the other with all reasonably requested information necessary to make such claim. Nothing contained in this Section 5.06 shall require Buyer or its Affiliates to pursue their rights under this Section 5.06 in lieu of their rights under any other provision of this Agreement and nothing contained in this Section 5.06 shall affect the rights of Buyer and its Affiliates under any other provision of this Agreement, except that any amounts received by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for a loss under this Section 5.06 may offset recovery for the same loss under Article 11 to the extent of the amount paid and received by Buyer.

contrary in this Section 6.03, Buyer will only be obligated to cause any

Section 6.03 if and for so long as Buyer is capable of directing the actions
of such person. Seller shall bear any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective employees or
Representatives as a result of complying with this Section 6.03. With respect
to the SONY Litigation, Seller agrees to act in a commercially reasonable
manner and not to take any action with the intent of harming the
reputation of the Business, Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Seller and its
Affiliates hereby agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the
SONY Litigation in such a manner, without compromising Sellers position, to
minimize disruption to the Business, including by providing, to the extent it
is reasonably practicable, reasonable advance notice to Buyer and its
Affiliates of the need to use the Transferred Employees as provided for in
this Section 6.03, and scheduling events, to the extent it is reasonably
practicable, to accommodate the schedules and reasonable requests of the
Transferred Employees and Buyer and its Affiliates. The parties hereto
hereby agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the SONY Litigation shall be an Excluded Liability retained by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement, and that nothing in this Section shall in any way
affect the treatment of the SONY Litigation under this Agreement as an
Excluded Liability. 

  

 Section 6.04 _. Post-Closing Obligations for Leases._ Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of Seller, exercise any right with regard to, or enter into, any amendment, renewal, modification or waiver of any Real Property Lease that extends the term thereof beyond its then-current term with respect to any Real Property Lease as to which Seller or one of its Affiliates remains the leasing party or a guarantor, or is otherwise secondarily liable for the obligations of the lessee, under such lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Real Property Lease that involves a month-to-month tenancy and with respect to which Seller or one of its Affiliates remains the leasing party or a guarantor or is otherwise secondarily liable, Buyer may extend such Real Property Lease (or otherwise continue or renew such month-to-month tenancy) so long as it is not later than the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent Buyer from seeking a novation of, or entering into a new lease for the real property relating to, any Real Property Lease as to which Seller remains the leasing party or a guarantor, or is otherwise secondarily liable for the obligations of the lessee under such lease, so long as such novation or new lease contains a full release of all obligations of Seller and/or its Affiliate, as the case may be, under such Real Property Lease with respect to periods after such novation or new lease. 

  

 Section 6.05 _. Replacement of Certain Obligations._ (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to, effective as of the Closing Date, (i) cause to be terminated each of the Parent Guarantees, (ii) replace the Seller Surety Bonds, and (iii) replace the Parent LofCs and terminate any reimbursement obligations or other Contracts between and 

   ##### 

  

    

among Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Subsidiary), on the one hand,
and the beneficiary of any such Parent Guarantee or the provider of any such
Seller Surety Bond or any such Parent LofC, on the other hand, in each case
that relates to any such Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond or Parent LofC
(each, a "Related Obligation or Contract"). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, for purposes of this Section 6.05, commercially reasonable
efforts will not require Buyer or Seller to institute escrow arrangements or
make any cash payments (other than to incur ordinary and reasonable costs and
expenses to have issued new surety bonds and letters of credit to replace the
Seller Surety Bonds and Parent LofCs) to any beneficiary to terminate
or replace any such Parent Guarantees, Seller Surety Bonds or Parent LofCs. 

  

 (b) To the extent that any Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract remains outstanding as of the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall have a continuing obligation after the Closing to use their commercially reasonable efforts to have any such Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract terminated or replaced after the Closing as contemplated by Section 6.05(a). To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates has performance obligations under any such Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract, Buyer and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to perform such obligations on behalf of such party or otherwise take such action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such party in the same position as if Buyer (or its Affiliates), and not such party, had performed or were performing such obligations. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall have any obligation to extend the term, or otherwise agree to any amendment or waiver, of any Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or any Related Obligation or Contract that remains outstanding after the Closing other than "change orders" entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with a value of less than 25% of the original value of the relevant Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract. 

  

 (c) If the termination or replacement of a particular Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract would in and of itself (with or without notice or lapse of time) violate, conflict with, result in a breach or default of, or otherwise give any Person additional rights or compensation under, or the right to terminate or accelerate, any Contract of the Business, such Parent Guarantee, Seller Surety Bond, Parent LofC or Related Obligation or Contract shall not be required to be terminated or replaced pursuant to this Section 6.05. Nothing in this Section 6.05(c) shall excuse either Buyer or Seller from any of its other obligations under this Section 6.05. 

  

 (d) Nothing in Section 6.05(b) affects Buyers right to seek indemnification under Section 11.02. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.06. _Targeted Technology Obligation_. Buyer agrees to comply with its obligations set forth on Schedule 6.06 at the times, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such Schedule.

affix the Excluded Marks (other than the M/A-COM Mark) (in the same manner
that such Excluded Marks were prior to the Closing so used, reproduced or

and its Affiliates prior to the date that is 90 days after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller hereby grants to Buyer and
its Affiliates (A) a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid and royalty free

Business is conducted, or proposed to be conducted, as of the Closing Date,
in each case of (i) or (ii), subject to the obligations set forth in Section

connection with a sale or transfer of a Divested Business (and will, for
the avoidance of doubt, continue to be effective with respect to the
purchaser or transferee of such Divested Business and its Affiliates and
their respective customers and suppliers), but only with respect to (x) the
activities contemplated in clauses (i) and/or (ii) above and (y) only to

understood that in no event shall the Buyer Covenant Not To Sue extend to any
other business, products or operations of the purchaser or transferee of a
Divested Business that are not the business, products or operations of the
Divested Business regardless of whether such business, products or operations
are similar or identical to the business, products or operations of such
Divested Business).

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Seller Covenant Not To Sue may be assigned or transferred in whole or part, in connection with a sale or transfer of a Divested Business (and will, for the avoidance of doubt, continue to be effective with respect to the purchaser or transferee of such Divested Business and its Affiliates and their respective customers and suppliers), but only with respect to (x) the activities contemplated in clauses (i) and/or (ii) above and (y) only to the extent that such activities relate to such Divested Business (it being understood that in no event shall the Seller Covenant Not To Sue extend to any other business, products or operations of the purchaser or transferee of a Divested Business that are not the business, products or operations of the Divested Business regardless of whether such business, products or operations are similar or identical to the business, products or operations of such Divested Business). For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Covenant Not To Sue shall not apply to the

performance, display or distribution of any Seller Product or any product or
service which is a substitute therefor.

Buyer shall also cause its Affiliates not to file any such Tax Returns or claims for refund of Taxes. 

  

 Section 8.05 _. Tax Contests._ (a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall provide notice to the other of any claim or potential claim for Taxes for which it may seek indemnification pursuant to Section 8.06. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted Tax claim in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice and other documents received from the Taxing Authority in respect of such Taxes.

If the party seeking indemnification fails to give the other party notice within such period, then (x) if the indemnifying party is precluded from 

   ##### 

  

  

contesting the asserted Tax Liability in any forum as a result of such
failure, the indemnifying party shall have no obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party for any Taxes arising out of such asserted Tax Liability,
and (y) if the indemnifying party is not precluded from contesting such
asserted Tax Liability in any forum, but such failure results in a monetary
detriment to the indemnifying party, then any amount that the indemnifying
party is otherwise required to pay the indemnified party pursuant to Section
8.06 hereof shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment. 

  

 (b) Seller or its designee shall have the right, upon written notice to Buyer within 30 days after delivery by Buyer to Seller of the notice described in Section 8.05(a), to control the conduct, including settlement or other disposition thereof, of any Contest relating to a Tax matter to the extent such Contest is in connection with any Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 8.01 hereof and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense in such Contest. Buyer shall have the right, at Buyers own expense, to consult with Seller regarding any Contest that might affect a taxable period that begins after the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period that begins after the Closing Date). 

  

 (c) Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of any Contest not described in Section 8.05(b). Seller shall have the right, at Sellers own expense, to consult with Buyer regarding any Contest that might affect a taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on the Closing Date). Buyer may settle or otherwise dispose of any such Contest only with the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

  

 Section 8.06 _. Indemnification._ (a) The indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 8.06 are the exclusive remedy for obligations of the parties arising under this Agreement that relate to Taxes, and Article 11 of this Agreement shall not apply to such obligations, except (i) that Article 11 of this Agreement shall apply to breaches of Section 3.15 and (ii) as specifically set forth in Section 11.04.

 (ii) for Sellers Taxes. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) Buyer shall be liable for, and covenants and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any and all Liabilities incurred by any of Seller or its Affiliates: 

   

 (i) by reason of a breach by Buyer of any covenant contained in this Article 8; or 

   

 (ii) for Buyers Taxes. 

  

 (d) If a party (the "Tax Indemnified Party") determines that it or any of its Affiliates is entitled to indemnification by another party (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") under Section 8.06(b) or Section 8.06(c) hereof, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party a written notice and demand therefor (the "Tax Notice") specifying the basis for indemnification and the amount for which the Tax Indemnified Party requests indemnification (a "Tax Claim"), together with any supporting documentation (including, if applicable, any relevant notice from any Taxing Authority). The Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying Party no later than 60 days before the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Tax Indemnified Party does not receive notice from the applicable Taxing Authority ("Taxing Authority Notice") that an item exists that could give rise to a Tax Claim more than 30 days before the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations, then the Tax Notice must be received by the Tax Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the Taxing Authority Notice (but in no event more than five Business Days after the Tax Indemnified Party receives the Taxing Authority Notice). If the Tax Indemnifying Party objects to the Tax Claim in the manner set forth in Section 8.06(e) hereof or if either the Tax Indemnifying Party or the Tax Indemnified Party exercises Contest rights as contemplated by Section 8.05, then the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to make an indemnification payment to the Tax Indemnified Party until there is a determination by the Accounting Referee or a Final Determination regarding the Tax Claim, as the case may be. In all other cases, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay the Tax Indemnified Party the amount set forth in the Tax Notice within 30 days after receipt of the Tax Notice. 

  

 (e) The Tax Indemnifying Party may object to any Tax Claim by giving the Tax Indemnified Party, within 30 days following receipt of the related Tax Notice, written notice setting forth the Tax Indemnifying Partys grounds for so objecting (the "Tax Objection Notice"). If the Tax Indemnifying Party does not give the Tax Indemnified Party the Tax Objection Notice within such 30-day period, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall be treated as having agreed to all elements of the Tax Claim and shall satisfy it in the manner provided in Section 8.06(d). 

  

 (f) If the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Indemnifying Party are unable to settle a dispute regarding a Tax Claim within 30 days after receipt of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Tax Objection Notice, the Tax Indemnified Party and the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall jointly request that the Accounting Referee to resolve the
dispute in the manner provided in Section 8.06. 

  

 (g) Failure by the Tax Indemnified Party to promptly deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party a Tax Notice in accordance with Section 8.06(d) hereof shall not relieve the Tax Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement except to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure.

Buyer shall return the amount of such refund (and any interest received thereon) or credit within five Business Days of written demand by Seller if Seller is required to return the refund to the Taxing Authority. 

  

 (c) Upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall file, or cause an Affiliate to file, claims for Sellers Refunds, in such form as Seller may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of any such claim will not result, in Buyers reasonable determination, in any prejudice to Buyer or its Affiliates. Seller shall have the sole right to prosecute any claims for Sellers Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Sellers expense and with counsel of Sellers choice. 

  

 (d) Upon the request of Buyer, Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to file, claims for Buyers Refunds, in such form as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the filing of any such claim will not result, in Sellers reasonable determination, in any prejudice to Seller or its Affiliates. Buyer shall have the sole right to prosecute any claims for Buyers Refunds (by suit or otherwise) at Buyers expense and with counsel of Buyers choice.

specified in Section 8.01(f). 

  

ARTICLE 9 
 Employee Benefits 

   

 Section 9.01 _. U.S. Business Employees and Employee Benefits._ (a) _Transfer and Terms and Conditions of Employment_. Within a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall offer employment to each U.S. Business Employee, commencing as of the Closing Date (or, with respect to any U.S. Business Employee not actively at work as of the Closing Date, as of the date that such U.S. Business Employee returns to active employment; _provided_ that such U.S. Business Employee returns to active employment within six months following the Closing Date), in the same job or position, at the same location (or within 50 miles of such location) and at the same (or a higher) rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation, in each case as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. For clarity, (i) "rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation" for this purpose and for the purposes of Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Section 9.04 shall exclude commissions, variable pay, target bonus, incentive compensation (including equity incentives), premium pay, overtime, shift differentials, perquisites, retirement, welfare or other benefits, retention amounts, change in control amounts and any similar payments and (ii) Buyer shall have no obligation to employ a U.S. Business Employee who is not actively at work as of the Closing Date and who does not return to active employment within six months following the Closing Date. Buyer, at the time such employment offers are so extended, shall provide to Seller appropriate information regarding employment terms and conditions offered to the U.S. Business Employees, which shall conform in all respects to the provisions of this Section 9.01. Buyer shall communicate with Seller prior to the extension of employment offers with respect to communicating the offers to the U.S. Business Employees. Each U.S. Business Employee who accepts such offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer is referred to as a "Transferred U.S. Employee," and all such employees collectively are referred to as the "Transferred U.S. Employees." For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing Date, Buyer covenants and agrees to (or to cause its Affiliates to) maintain compensation and benefits for the benefit of the Transferred U.S. Employees that are, in the aggregate, not substantially less favorable, as reasonably determined in good faith by Buyer, than the Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing Date, Buyer covenants and agrees that each Transferred U.S. Employees rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be reduced; _provided that_ this provision shall not preclude Buyers implementation of any reduced hours arrangement, furlough program or similar arrangements to 

   ##### 

  

    

the extent Transferred U.S. Employees are treated no less favorably than
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. Subject to
the Transfer Regulations (to the extent relevant), no provision in this
Agreement shall (i) give any Transferred U.S. Employee any right to continued
employment with Buyer or impair in any way the right of Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer to terminate or change the terms of the employment (other than the
rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation as provided above) of
any employee, including any Transferred U.S. Employee, after the Closing Date
or (ii) preclude Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer from altering, amending or
terminating any of its employee benefit plans (including any Assumed Plan),
or the participation of any of its employees in such plans, at any time.
Effective as of the Closing, Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall
terminate the employment of all U.S. Business Employees actively at work as
of immediately prior to the Closing. 

  

 (b) _COBRA_. Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, or similar state statutes ("COBRA"), including the provision of continuation coverage, with respect to all Former Employees and all Business Employees who do not become Transferred U.S. Employees, and, in each case, their spouses and dependents, and with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees, and their spouses and dependents, for whom a qualifying event occurs on or prior to the date they become Transferred U.S. Employees. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for compliance with the requirements of COBRA with respect to qualifying events with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees, and their spouses and dependents, that occur after the date such employees become Transferred U.S. Employees. For purposes of this Section 9.01(b), the terms "continuation coverage" and "qualifying event" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in COBRA. 

  

 (c) _Severance_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect for at least 12 months following the Closing Date severance plans, practices and policies applicable to each Transferred U.S. Employee that are not less favorable in the aggregate, as reasonably determined by Buyer in good faith, than such plans, practices and policies in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Transferred U.S. Employee as identified on Schedule 9.01(c). For the avoidance of doubt, Seller will be liable for (i) any retention, change in control, bonus or other amount described in Section 2.04(f) (including the employer portion of any payroll, social security, unemployment or similar Taxes) and (ii) any severance Liabilities with respect to Former Employees. 

  

 (d) _Assumed Compensation and Benefits_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assume, honor and be solely responsible for paying, providing and satisfying when due all Assumed Compensation and Benefits for the benefit of Transferred U.S. Employees. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Tax-Qualified Plans_. Each Transferred U.S. Employee who is a participant in the Tyco Electronics Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (the "Tyco Electronics Savings Plan") shall cease to be an active participant under such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have, or shall cause its Affiliates to have, in effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer Savings Plan") in which Transferred U.S. Employees who meet the eligibility criteria thereof shall be eligible to participate. Effective as of the Closing Date, each Transferred U.S. Employee shall become fully vested in his or her account balance in the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan. Buyer agrees to cause the Buyer Savings Plan to accept rollovers by Transferred U.S. Employees from the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan, including promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans. Buyer agrees that it will be solely responsible for amounts charged by the third-party administrator of the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan and paid by Seller in connection with rollovers by Transferred U.S. Employees from the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan to the Buyer Savings Plan that exceed the amounts that would have been charged by the third-party administrator of the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan and paid by Seller had the accounts of Transferred U.S. Employees in the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan been transferred to the Buyer Savings Plan in a mandatory trust-to-trust transfer. Seller agrees that it will use good faith efforts to avoid or mitigate charges by the third-party administrator of the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan in connection with the rollovers contemplated by this Section 9.01(e), including consulting with Buyer prior to authorizing such charges and permitting Buyer or the third-party administrator of the Buyer Savings Plan to assume responsibility for actions for which the third-party administrator of the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan would asses charges, including drafting and sending participant communications regarding the availability of such rollovers (which communications shall be mutually acceptable in form and substance to both Seller and Buyer). Buyer agrees that it will cause the third-party administrator of the Buyer Savings Plan to accept any rollover contemplated pursuant to this Section 9.01(e) no later than sixty days following the latest date that Buyer receives the documentation from the Transferred U.S. Employee and the third-party administrator of the Tyco Electronics Savings Plan necessary for the third-party administrator of the Buyer Savings Plan to process such rollover. 

  

 (f) _Certain Welfare Plan Matters_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain or cause its Affiliates to maintain a group health plan in which Transferred U.S. Employees, and their respective spouses and dependents, who meet the eligibility criteria thereof may participate. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall use, or shall cause its Affiliates to use, its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work exclusions are applicable to any Transferred U.S. Employees covered by a welfare benefit plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, or their dependents or beneficiaries, under 

   ##### 

  

    

any similar welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates in
which such Transferred U.S. Employees may be eligible to participate
(except to the extent that such a waiting period, exclusion or limitation was
in effect and had not been satisfied under the Benefit Plan in which such
employee, dependent or beneficiary was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and without regard to any such waiting
period, exclusion or limitation that applies solely to employees who do not
elect welfare benefit plan coverage upon initial eligibility for the plan)
and (ii) to provide that any costs or expenses incurred by the Transferred
U.S. Employees (and their respective dependents and beneficiaries) under the
Benefit Plans with respect to the plan year that includes the Closing Date, up
to (and including) the Closing Date, shall be specifically applied for
purposes of satisfying any similar deductible, co-payment, coinsurance,
maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on
coverage under any such welfare benefit plans. Except as provided in
Section 9.01(b), Section 9.01(h) or Section 9.01(j), Buyer shall be
responsible under the employee welfare benefit plans of Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer for all amounts payable by reason of claims incurred by Transferred
U.S. Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries after the date
they become Transferred U.S. Employees.

Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall cause the balance of each Transferred U.S. Employees accounts under the Tyco Electronics Cafeteria Plan as of the Closing Date to be credited to the Transferred U.S. Employees corresponding accounts under the Buyer Cafeteria Plan in which such employees participate following the Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims for reimbursement by Transferred U.S. Employees, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of the Buyer Cafeteria Plan, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any and all claims by or with respect to Transferred U.S. Employees for reimbursement under the Tyco Electronics Cafeteria Plan that have not been paid in full as of the Closing Date.

Buyer shall be solely responsible for supplemental life and disability (whether long-term or short-term) coverage of all Transferred U.S. Employees after the date that such employees commence employment with Buyer and its Affiliates, even if the incident or circumstance giving rise to such coverage occurred prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any Liabilities (calculated in the manner set forth on Schedule 9.01(h)) with respect to short-term disability coverage provided to any Transferred U.S. Employee on and after the Closing Date but prior to his or her active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; _provided_ that such Transferred U.S. Employee returns to active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer within six months following the Closing Date.

   ##### 

  

    

wages or other base compensation, and under reasonably comparable employee
benefits in the aggregate as are made available to such Quebec Business
Employee immediately before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in respect of any Canadian Business Employee who is on short-term disability,
pregnancy or parental leave, or other authorized leave of absence on the
Closing Date, other than a Quebec Business Employee, the terms of the offer
made to any such Canadian Business Employee by Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall specify that the offer is conditional upon the Canadian Business
Employees return to active employment, and the date on which such Canadian
Business Employee returns to active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer shall be the effective date of employment for the Canadian
Business Employee. Until such Canadian Business Employee accepts Buyers or
its Affiliates offer of employment, as applicable, and reports to active
employment (the date that such Canadian Business Employee reports to active
employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer being the "Canadian Deferred
Hire Date"), he or she shall remain in Sellers or its Affiliates employ and
continue to participate in Sellers or its Affiliates Benefit Plans and
Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall retain all Liabilities in
respect of such Canadian Business Employee until the Canadian Deferred Hired
Date. Each Canadian Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment made
pursuant to this Section 9.02 and commences employment with Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer, or continues employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer is referred to as a "Transferred Canadian Employee." For a period of at
least 12 months following the Closing Date, Buyer covenants and agrees that
each Transferred Canadian Employees rate of base salary, wages or other
base compensation as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall
not be reduced; _provided_ that this provision shall not preclude Buyers
implementation of any reduced hours arrangement, furlough program or similar
arrangements in accordance with Applicable Law to the extent
Transferred Canadian Employees are treated no less favorably than similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. No provision in this
Agreement shall (i) give any Transferred Canadian Employee any right to
continued employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or impair in any way
the right of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to terminate or change the terms
of the employment (other than the rate of base salary, wages or other base
compensation as provided above) of any employee, including any Transferred
Canadian Employee, after the Closing Date in accordance with Applicable Law or
(ii) preclude Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer from altering, amending or
terminating any of its employee benefit plans (including any Assumed Plan),
or the participation of any of its employees in such plans, at any time.

The parties hereto accept for the purposes of this Agreement that the Transfer Regulations apply in Ireland. With respect to any Irish Business Employee, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall take over each Irish Business Employee on terms and conditions not less favorable on an individual basis in the aggregate than the terms and conditions provided immediately prior to the Closing Date, except as otherwise 

   #####

Regulations). For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing Date,

extent relevant, Buyer covenants and agrees that each Irish Business
Employees rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be reduced; _provided_ that,
subject to Applicable Law (including the Transfer Regulations), this
provision shall not preclude Buyers implementation of any reduced
hours arrangement, furlough program or similar arrangements to the extent
Irish Business Employees are treated no less favorably then similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. Subject to Applicable Law
(including the Transfer Regulations), no provision in this Agreement
shall (i) give any Irish Business Employee any right to continued employment
with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or impair in any way the right of Buyer
or an Affiliate of Buyer to terminate or change the terms of the employment
(other than the rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation as
provided above) of any employee, including any Irish Business Employee, after
the Closing Date or (ii) preclude Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer from
altering, amending or terminating any of its employee benefit plans
(including any Assumed Plan), or the participation of any of its employees in
such plans, at any time. 

  

 Section 9.04 _. Other Business Employees. Transfer and Terms and Conditions of Employment_. With respect to any Business Employee who is not a U.S. Business Employee, a Canadian Business Employee or an Irish Business Employee (an "Other Business Employee"), effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall offer employment to or otherwise accept into employment each Other Business Employee at the same rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation, and under reasonably comparable employee benefits in the aggregate as are made available to such individual immediately before the applicable Closing Date, save as otherwise required or sufficient to comply with Applicable Law (including the Transfer Regulations). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Applicable Law (including the Transfer Regulations), in respect of any Other Business Employee who is on a short-term disability, pregnancy, parental or other authorized leave of absence on the Closing Date, the effective date of employment shall not be the Closing Date but rather the terms of an offer made to any such Other Business Employee shall specify that the offer is conditional upon the Other Business Employee returning to active employment and the date on which such employee returns to active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall be the effective date of employment. Until such Other Business Employee accepts Buyer or its Affiliates offer of employment, as applicable, and reports to active employment (the date that such Other Business Employee reports to active employment being the "Deferred Hire Date"), he or she shall remain in Sellers or its Affiliates employ and continue to participate in Sellers or its Affiliates Benefit Plans and Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, shall retain all Liabilities in respect of such Other Business Employee until the Deferred Hire Date. Each Other Business Employee who accepts such offer of employment and commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or 

   ##### 

  

    

transfers under the Transfer Regulations is referred to as a "Transferred
Other Employee." For a period of at least 12 months following the Closing
Date, and subject to Applicable Law (including the Transfer Regulations)
to the extent relevant, Buyer covenants and agrees that each Transferred
Other Employees rate of base salary, wages or other base compensation as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be reduced; provided
that this provision shall not preclude Buyers implementation of any reduced
hours arrangement, furlough program or similar arrangements to the extent
Transferred Other Employees are treated no less favorably then similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. No provision in this
Agreement shall (i) give any Other Business Employee any right to continued
employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer or impair in any way the right
of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to terminate or change the terms of the
employment (other than the rate of base salary, wages or other base
compensation as provided above) of any employee, including any Transferred
Other Employee, after the Closing Date or (ii) preclude Buyer or an Affiliate
of Buyer from altering, amending or terminating any of its employee benefit
plans (including any Assumed Plan), or the participation of any of its
employees in such plans, at any time. To the extent not prohibited by

applicable Affiliate shall terminate the employment of all Other Business
Employees actively at work as of immediately prior to the Closing.

Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for the waiver of any waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work restrictions under any of its or any Buyer Affiliates health and welfare plans in which Transferred Canadian Employees or the Irish Business Employees (or each of their dependents or beneficiaries) are or will be enrolled (except to the extent that such a waiting period, exclusion or limitation was in 

   ##### 

  

    

effect and was not satisfied under the Benefit Plan in which such employee,
dependent or beneficiary was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing Date). Buyer agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide that any costs or expenses incurred by the Transferred Canadian
Employees and the Irish Business Employees (and each of their respective
dependents and beneficiaries) under the health and welfare benefit plans in
which the Transferred Canadian Employees and the Irish Business Employees are
enrolled with respect to the plan year that includes the Closing Date, up to
(and including) the Closing Date, shall be specifically applied for purposes
of satisfying any similar deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-
of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under

hereby agree that on or before, or as soon as reasonably practicable

after receipt of notice by the Indemnified Party of the assertion of such
claim by a third party or the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding;
_provided_  that any failure or delay on the party of the Indemnified Party
to give such notice to the Indemnifying Party will not affect the Indemnified
Partys right to recover on or under any such Legal Proceeding unless and to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure or
delay. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, any Legal Proceeding brought by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"); _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party will only be entitled to assume and conduct the defense of any Third Party Claim to the extent that (i) the Third Party Claim does not primarily seek non-monetary relief and (ii) prior to the commencement of such Third Party Claim, the applicable cap on recovery by the Indemnified Party has not been exceeded . If the Indemnifying Party elects to conduct and control any Third-Party Claim, it shall, within 30 days of receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to conduct and control any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may conduct and control any Third-Party Claim and keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in, but not control, the defense of any such Legal Proceeding which the Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to control or conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall nevertheless keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to participate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and, at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.05(b) to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim unless the settlement or compromise involves only the payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.05(b) to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim. 

  

 (c) The parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the retention and the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim and (ii) the making available of employees on a mutually convenient 

   ##### 

  

    

basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. 

  

 Section 11.06. _Calculation of Damages._ Except with respect to Damages payable to a third party in connection with a Third-Party Claim, in no event shall any party or its Affiliates be liable under this Article 11 for any indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages or damages for lost profits arising out of its performance or non-performance of any provision of this Agreement regardless of the nature of the claim or whether such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

  

 Section 11.07. _Environmental Indemnity for Transferred New York Tower Sites._ Seller agrees that if any Buyer Indemnitee incurs or suffers Damages relating to the Transferred New York Tower Sites ("Buyer Environmental Damages") for which Seller is reasonably likely to have a claim for indemnification pursuant to the terms of Section 9.6 of the Com-Net Agreement (the "Com-Net Indemnity"), upon receipt of written request of Buyer, Seller shall seek to assign to such Buyer Indemnitee its rights to such Com-Net Indemnity with respect to such Buyer Environmental Damages. If Seller is able to assign such rights, Seller shall have no further obligations with respect to such Buyer Environmental Damages, except with respect to any such Buyer Environmental Damages otherwise subject to indemnification under Section 11.02 or as provided in the last sentence of this Section 11.07. If Seller is not able to procure such assignment, Seller agrees to directly pursue the Com-Net Indemnity with respect to such Buyer Environmental Damages and Seller shall indemnify Buyer Indemnitee for such Buyer Environmental Damages to the extent it received payment therefor under the Com-Net Indemnity. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Buyers or Sellers claim, as applicable, under the Com-Net Indemnity is not successful with regard to any Buyer Environmental Damages, then each of Buyer and Seller shall continue to have whatever rights and obligations relating to such Buyer Environmental Damages it would otherwise have pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 11.08. _Environmental Procedures._ With respect to any claims involving the investigation, remediation, removal, corrective action, containment, monitoring or other response action relating to the existence of environmental contamination, including claims made under Section 11.02(a)(i) with respect to Section 3.19, under Section 11.02(a)(v) with respect to any Excluded Environmental Liability, under Section 11.03(c) or (d) with respect to environmental matters or under Section 11.07 (collectively, "Environmental Claims"), Buyer, Seller and their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, shall act in a Commercially Reasonable Manner. Seller shall have no obligation for any Damages arising out of any Environmental Claim to the extent such Damages result from or are the consequence, in whole or in part, of any intrusive sampling, testing or monitoring of soil or groundwater performed by or on behalf of Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, unless (and only to the extent) such action is (a) required by an Environmental Law, order, injunction, decree or ruling of 

   ##### 

  

    

any Governmental Authority or a Permit in effect at the time such action is
taken; (b) subject to Section 11.05, reasonably necessary in connection with
the defense or resolution of a Third-Party Claim; (c) reasonably necessary
to investigate conditions that indicate an imminent and substantial
endangerment to human health as reasonably determined by Buyer; (d) required
pursuant to any applicable Real Property Lease as in effect as of the Closing
Date or, if less restrictive, as amended thereafter; (e) reasonably necessary
to obtain financing or a mortgage, or in connection with a potential sale of
any Real Property or the Business; (f) conducted in connection with
construction or maintenance projects at any Real Property provided that such
projects serve a legitimate business purpose unrelated to conducting
intrusive sampling, testing or monitoring of the Environment for purposes of
seeking indemnification hereunder; or (g) conducted in connection with
properly maintaining any production or drinking water wells that are the
responsibility of Buyer and that exist at any Real Property on the Closing
Date. Buyer and Seller agree that, with respect to any Environmental Claim
arising out of a Release of any Hazardous Substance, the issuance of a no
further action letter or the equivalent indicia of completion issued by any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Releases or remediation ("NFA
Letter") shall fully resolve any investigation, remediation,
removal, corrective action, containment, monitoring or other response
obligation of Seller with respect to such Environmental Claim and such
Release; _provided_ , that this sentence shall not apply to the extent any
Environmental Claim arising out of a claim brought by any third party is not
settled as a result of the receipt of an NFA Letter; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Seller may not invoke the receipt of the NFA Letter as a reason to avoid
fulfilling any remaining obligations with respect to such Environmental Claim
in the event (x) the NFA Letter contains re-openers or other provisions
that reserve the right of the issuing Governmental Authority to require
additional investigation, remediation, removal, corrective action,
containment, monitoring or other response action with respect to Hazardous
Substances ("Re-Opener"), (y) the Re-Opener is not triggered through
any action or omission of Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives (other than any action described in clauses (a) through (g)
of this Section 11.08) and (z) in the case of any Environmental Claim made
under Section 11.02(a)(i), the Re-Opener is triggered before the
fifth anniversary of the NFA Letter. In no event shall Seller be obligated to
pay any Damages arising out of any Environmental Claim to the extent such
Damages arise due to a change in the use of the relevant Real Property to any
use other than commercial or industrial use after the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 11.09 _. Parent Guarantee._ Immediately prior to the occurrence of a Guarantee Trigger Event, Seller Parent, on behalf of itself and its permitted successors and assigns, shall enter into a guarantee in favor of Buyer and each Buyer Indemnitee in respect of each and every covenant, agreement and other obligation in effect at such time of Seller and/or any of its Affiliates and permitted assigns under this Agreement and each other Transaction Document in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit G_ hereto. For purposes of this Section 11.09, a "Guarantee Trigger Event" means (a) Seller ceasing to hold, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the ownership interests in all of the material 

   ##### 

  

    

operating subsidiaries that are material to Seller Parents consolidated
financial results taken as a whole and held, directly or indirectly, by Seller
Parent, as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "Operating Subsidiaries")
or (b) the taking of any action by Seller Parent that results in Seller
Parent owning, directly or indirectly, any Operating Subsidiaries other than
through its ownership of its equity interest of Seller (or in other words if
Seller will cease to own directly or indirectly all of the Operating
Subsidiaries owned indirectly or directly by Seller Parent). 

  

 Section 11.10 _. Exclusive Remedy/Waiver._ The parties acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing, Article 8 and this Article 11 shall provide the exclusive remedy for any party for any type of claim for which such party is indemnified pursuant to Article 8 or this Article 11. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereby waive, effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance) for breach of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the foregoing shall not apply to any deliberate breach of this Agreement by Buyer or Seller or to claims for specific performance or injunctive relief or claims based on fraud. 

  

ARTICLE 12 
 Termination 

   

 Section 12.01 _. Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

 (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the nine-month anniversary of the date hereof (unless the failure to consummate the Closing by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement); 

  

 (c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction; 

  

 (d) by Buyer if any of the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement are inaccurate or untrue to the extent that any such inaccuracy or untruth would cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 10.02(a)(ii) or if Seller has failed to discharge and fulfill any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent that any such failure would 

   ##### 

  

    

cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 10.02(a)(i), and, if
such inaccuracy or failure is capable of being cured, such inaccuracy or
failure has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of such
failure, inaccuracy or untruth has been given to Seller; or 

  

 (e) by Seller if any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement are inaccurate or untrue to the extent that any such inaccuracy or untruth would cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 10.03(a)(ii) or if Buyer has failed to discharge and fulfill any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent that any such failure would cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 10.03(a)(i), and, if such inaccuracy or failure is capable of being cured, such inaccuracy or failure has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of such failure, inaccuracy or untruth has been given to Buyer. 

  

 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 12.01(b)  (e) shall give notice of such termination to the other party. 

  

 Section 12.02 _. Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of either party (or any stockholder or Representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result from the (i) willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) willful breach by either party hereto of any representation or warranty contained herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 6.01, 13.04, 13.06, 13.07, 13.08, 13.09, 13.10, 13.12, 13.13, 13.14, and this Section 12.02 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.

 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. 

  

 Section 13.03 _. Disclosure Schedule References. _The parties hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. 

  

 Section 13.04 _. Expenses._ Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense. 

  

 Section 13.05 _. Successors and Assigns._ The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;  _provided_ that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign its right to receive all or any portion of the Purchased Assets or delegate its obligation to pay all or any portion of the Purchase Price to any of Buyers Affiliates; _provided_ that such delegation will not relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 13.06 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state. 

  

 Section 13.07 _. Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that, except as set forth in Article 2 or Article 8, any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware State court 

   ##### 

  

    

sitting in Delaware, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Legal Proceeding, and that any cause of action arising
out of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of
business in the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to jurisdiction or the laying of the venue of any such Legal Proceeding
in any such court and any objection that it may now or hereafter have that
any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Seller and its Affiliates agree that final judgment, including
any appeals, in any such Legal Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent that Seller or its
Affiliates have or hereafter may acquire any immunity from the jurisdiction
of any court or from any legal process (whether through service or notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, or otherwise)
with respect to Seller or its Affiliates or their property, Seller and its
Affiliates hereby irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of their
obligations under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each
party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
13.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall affect either partys right to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 13.08 _. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

  

 Section 13.09 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Except as provided for in Article 11, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 13.10 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

  

 Section 13.11 _. Bulk Sales Laws._ Buyer and Seller each hereby waive compliance by Seller with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or similar laws of any state. 

  

 Section 13.12 _. No Strict Construction._ The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by all parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 13.13 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 13.14 _. Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware State court sitting in Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 13.15 _. Payment in U.S. Dollars._ All amounts to be paid to under this Agreement, or any order, judgment, assessment, award, ruling, charge, decree or writ entered by any Governmental Authority in any Legal Proceeding brought under, arising out of or with respect to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be paid in the United States in U.S. Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds. To the extent payment is not legally possible in U.S. Dollars and payment is required to be paid in any other currency, Seller shall make sufficient payment in such other currency such that Buyer shall receive after conversion of such funds into U.S. Dollars the amount of U.S. Dollars required to 

   ##### 

  

    

be paid and received under this Agreement plus any costs incurred by Buyer in
converting such foreign currency into U.S. Dollars. To the extent Seller is
required to deduct, withhold or retain any amounts under any Applicable Law
with respect to any payments under this Agreement because payments are being
made from outside of the United States, Seller shall be required to pay such
additional amounts to Buyer such that after any such deduction, withholding
or retention required by Applicable Law, Buyer receives the amounts in U.S.
Dollars specified in this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.
