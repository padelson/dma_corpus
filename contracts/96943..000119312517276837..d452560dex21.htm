Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Milestone 2 Payment shall be subject to
offset and reduction as provided for in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_.

30 consecutive calendar days which is caused by a corporate warning letter
issued by the FDA to Parent or its Affiliates or a consent decree (or other
Order) from a Governmental Entity against Parent or its Affiliates;
_provided_ that a Milestone Delay Event shall be deemed to have not occurred
if such corporate warning letter, consent decree or other Order resulted from
the Products or operation of the Company Business.

 

The " _Milestone Delay Factor_ " shall be a number equal to (x) the number of
aggregate days for all Milestone Delay Event(s), _divided by_ (y) 365 days.
In the event that the Milestone Delay Factor is greater than one, then the
Milestone Delay Factor will be deemed to be one for the first annual period,
and an additional Milestone Delay Payment will be due for the immediately
following annual period (or more annual periods as necessary), with this
clause (g) to be applied mutatis mutandis, with the Milestone Delay Factor for
any such year to be the lesser of (A) one and (B) the Milestone Delay Factor
(determined without regard for this sentence) minus any previous Milestone
Delay Factors used in prior years.

 

(iii) If there is a Milestone Delay Payment pursuant to _Section_ __ _

Companys payroll (or by check for any holder who is not a current employee of
the Company), the funds received pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6(e)_ to
the former holders of Company Options, in each case in accordance with this
_Article II_.

 



16 (iv) The " _Milestone Delay Per Share Payment_ " means an amount equal to the
quotient of (A) the Milestone Delay Payment _minus_ the Advisor Fees _divided
by_ (B) the then-applicable Fully Diluted Share Number.

 

(f) _Calculation of Milestone Payments_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable and in any event within 45 days after the end
of the period for determining Net Sales applicable to, as the case may be,
the 2018 Initial Milestone Payment, the Milestone 1 Payment, the Milestone 2
Payment, the Milestone 3 Payment and Milestone Delay Payment, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the "
_Milestone Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation,
as applicable, of the 2018 Initial Milestone Payment, the Milestone 1 Payment,
the Milestone 2 Payment, the Milestone 3 Payment and Milestone Delay Payment,
as well as the information required in an Update Report pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.6(g)(i)_ below.

 

(ii) After delivery of the applicable Milestone Statement, Buyer shall give
the Stockholder Representative reasonable access to review the work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Representatives in connection with
the preparation of the applicable Milestone Statement and Buyer and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause their Representatives to reasonably
cooperate with and respond to such inquiries and otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Stockholder Representative in the review of such Milestone
Statement, including by providing reasonable access to the books and records
of the Surviving Corporation in connection therewith.

(iii) Within 45 days after delivery of the applicable Milestone Statement to
the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will advise
Buyer in writing whether it agrees with the Net Sales for the applicable
period set forth such Milestone Statement or whether the Stockholder
Representative objects to such Net Sales. If the Stockholder Representative
disputes the Net Sales included on such Milestone Statement, it shall deliver
to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto, setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, the dollar amounts involved and
the Stockholder Representatives calculation of such Net Sales and Milestone
Statement, within 45 days of Buyers delivery of such Milestone Statement to
the Stockholder Representative (such written notice of objection, the "
_Milestone Objection Statement_ "). If such Milestone Objection Statement is
not delivered to Buyer within 45 days after delivery of such
Milestone Statement to the Stockholder Representative, such Milestone
Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto.
The Stockholder Representative and Parent shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any objections made by the Stockholder Representative, but if they do
not reach a final resolution within 45 days after the delivery of such
Milestone Objection Statement, either the Stockholder Representative or Buyer
may submit the Net Sales in dispute for final resolution to the Arbitrator.
Each Party agrees to execute, if requested by the Arbitrator, a reasonable and
customary engagement letter, including customary indemnities. The Arbitrator
shall consider only those Net Sales which Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any item of dispute, the

 



17  Arbitrator may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such Net Sales item claimed by the Stockholder Representative or
less than the smallest value for such Net Sales item claimed by Buyer. Buyer
and the Stockholder Representative shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Arbitrator to resolve all disagreements as soon as
practicable and in any event within thirty days after the submission of any
dispute to the Arbitrator. The resolution of the dispute by the Arbitrator
shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto, absent
manifest error. The costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by
Buyer and the Stockholder Representative based on the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to such Party bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party, as finally determined by the Arbitrator.
The Arbitrator shall not resolve any other disputes relating to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_ other than the calculation of the Net Sales. For
avoidance of doubt, acceptance by either party of the methodology for
calculating any Milestone Payment shall not be deemed to bind or prejudice
such party with respect to the methodology of calculating any other Milestone
Payment.

 

(g) _Update Reports and Meetings_.

 

(i) Parent shall, within 10 Business Days after the date Parent files its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K for any fiscal
quarter or end of fiscal year, as applicable, send to the Stockholder
Representative a reasonably detailed report regarding the status of efforts
to achieve the Milestone Payments and Parents calculation of Net Sales for
such fiscal period (each such report, an " _Update Report_ "), along with
reasonable supporting detail (to the same extent that such information is
provided to the management of the Company prior to the date of this Agreement)
by quarter of: (A) Net Sales by geographical region, including by region
within the United States, (B) number of accounts purchasing Products in the
United States, (C) number of units of Product sold in the United States, (D)
average price per unit of Product in the United States, (E) units revenue per
Sales Employee in the United States, (F) average orders Net Sales by account

days prior notice), Representatives of Parent shall meet (in person at the
Companys headquarters, unless otherwise agreed) with the Stockholder
Representative and/or its designees, to discuss the Update Report and/or any
other matters relating to the Milestone Payments (each such meeting, an "
_Update Meeting_ "). Parent shall make available for each such Update
Meeting, a Representative of Parent with direct, overall managerial
responsibility for the Product and such other of its employees and
Representatives of Parent and/or its Affiliates as Parent may reasonably
deem appropriate and designate in writing from time to time or that the
Stockholders Representative and/or its designees may reasonably request, who
will respond to reasonable written inquiries of the Stockholder Representative
and/or its designees regarding the applicable Update Report.

 



18 (iii) Parent shall make available to the Stockholder Representative and/or
its designees information concerning the Products and the Milestone Payments
as the Stockholder Representative may reasonably request in relation to the
Update Report or to the Update Meeting; _provided_ that Parent shall not be
required to provide such access or furnish such information if Parent in good
faith reasonably believes that doing so would reasonably be expected to (i)
breach or violate any applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
(ii) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product
privilege or (iii) violate any confidentiality obligation with respect to such
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties agree to collaborate in
good faith to make alternative arrangements to allow for such access or
disclosure in a manner that does not result in the events set out in clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) above.

 

(h) _Parent Obligations_.

 

(i) Parent, Buyer and the Company shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
achieve the maximum amount of the Milestone Payments. None of Parent, Buyer
and the Company shall take any action with the primary intent of avoiding or
reducing any of the Milestone Payments.

Employee that is a Continuing Employee, the same sales incentive compensation
for achievement of target amount, incentives for over-achievement of target

Disclosure Letter; 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent,

     | (C) | until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent,
and its Affiliates shall not acquire or operate any business that develops,
produces, markets or sells a Competing Product, _provided_ , that Parent or
its Affiliates may acquire such a business solely if the Competing Product of
such business is still under development and will not be initially
commercialized until the second anniversary of the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



19 (iii) Parent shall have the right, from time to time, to request from
the Stockholder Representative waivers or consents to the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.6(h)_. In connection with such requests, Parent shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative
in connection with evaluating such request, and, upon request by the
Stockholder Representative, shall make available a Representative of Parent
with direct, overall managerial responsibility for the Product to discuss such
request. The Stockholder Representative shall consider each such request in
good faith and its approval with respect thereto shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned to the extent that the likelihood of
achieving any Milestone Payment would not reasonably be expected to be
reduced as a result thereof, as determined in the Stockholder Representatives
reasonable discretion.

(i)  _Acceleration_. In the event of the occurrence of any of the following
events, any Milestone Payments that have not been paid shall be immediately
due and payable in full: (1) Parent or the Surviving Corporation commences any

other relief under state or federal bankruptcy laws; (2) any such proceeding
is commenced against Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or a receiver or

its commencement; (3) Parent or the Surviving Corporation makes an assignment

appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for all or substantially all
of its assets or has a receiver, custodian or trustee appointed for all or
substantially all of its assets; or (4) a Change of Control is consummated.

 

(j) _Advisor Fees_. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of any
Advisor Fees relating to any Milestone Payments to the applicable advisor of
the Company.

(k) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Milestone 1 Payment _plus_ the Milestone 2
Payment _plus_ the Milestone 3 Payment _plus_ any Milestone Delay Payments(s)
be in excess of $300,000,000.

 

(l) Certain payments shall be made on behalf of the holders of Company Capital
Stock to the specified individuals on the terms set forth on Section 2.6(k)

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer and the Stockholder Representative

") and used to satisfy the payments required to be made to the former holders
of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants in accordance with this
_Article II_. If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund shall be
insufficient (including

 



20  because of investment loss) to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made pursuant to this _Article II_ , Buyer shall promptly deposit into
the Payment Fund the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations. Except as provided for in this Agreement, the Payment

Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants as described in the Paying Agent

such customary provisions as the Paying Agent, Buyer and the Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of shares of Company Capital Stock and Company
Warrants in exchange for the payments contemplated by this _Article II_. If
the Paying Agent receives a duly completed letter of transmittal from a holder
of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Paying Agent shall, on the Closing Date, make

2.3(b)_ to such holder of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants and
otherwise, the Paying Agent shall as promptly as practicable after receipt of

Capital Stock or Company Warrants has been lost, stolen or destroyed shall

certificate or Company Warrants if such Person (a) provides an
affidavit (reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) that such certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, (b) posts a bond (in such reasonable
amount as the Paying Agent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such certificate and (c) has otherwise complied with this _Section_

by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section_ __ _ 262_") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the payments contemplated by this _Article II_ , and instead,
such Appraisal Shares shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and the holders of such Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto except such rights as may be granted to such holders
pursuant to Section 262; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or

 



21  otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262, then such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, the payments contemplated by this _Article II_. The Company shall
provide prompt notice to Buyer of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time

Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours to its and the Company
Subsidiaries properties, books and records, and to its and the
Company Subsidiaries officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
Representatives and the Company shall make available to Parent all information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided_  that the Company shall not be required to provide such
access or furnish such information if the Company in good faith reasonably
believes that doing so would reasonably be expected to (i) breach or violate
any applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, (ii) result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege or
(iii) violate any confidentiality obligation with respect to such information;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties agree to collaborate in good faith
to make alternative arrangements to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in the events set out in clauses (i), (ii) or
(iii) above. No investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall
constitute a waiver of or otherwise affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the Company set forth herein. Any access to any
Company properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security
measures and the applicable requirements of the Leases and shall not include
the right to perform any "invasive" testing or soil, air or groundwater

environmental assessments.

(b) All information furnished by a Party or any of its Representatives to
another Party or its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement (including

(a) The Company and Parent agree to make (or cause to be made) an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act on the date
of this Agreement or within one Business Day following the date hereof
(pursuant to which Parent and the Company shall request early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act).

 



44 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in
any event prior to the Outside Date); (ii) prepare as promptly as practicable
all necessary applications, notices, filings, requests and other documents to
be made or filed by such Party (and cooperate with the other Parties with
respect to any applications, notices, filings, requests and other documents to
be made or filed by the other Parties) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) obtain as promptly as practicable
all consents, approvals, clearances, permits, authorizations, registrations,
filings or notices from any Governmental Entity (or other Person) which is
required to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its Subsidiaries and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required (and without
the prior consent of Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not), take
any action with respect to any order or any applicable Law or in order to
obtain any approval, consent or clearance which is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger.

 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including those set
forth elsewhere in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party in writing
of any substantive communication (oral and written) received by such party
from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity with respect to any
applications, notices, filings or requests made (or any consents, approvals or
clearances sought to be obtained) in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other
Parties apprised, on a current basis of the status thereof); (ii) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party in writing
of any substantive communication (oral and written) received by such Party
from, or given by such Party to, any Person that is not a Governmental Entity
in connection with any Proceeding (or threatened Proceeding) by such Person
regarding or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (iii) consult with the other Parties (subject to applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information) in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to any
applications, notices, filings or requests made (or any consents, approvals or
clearances sought to be obtained) in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) use reasonable best efforts to furnish
to the other Party and, upon request, to any Governmental Entities such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and using reasonable best
efforts to comply fully with any request for additional information or
documents under any applicable Law; and (v) not independently participate in
any meeting (including telephonic meetings) with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the foregoing without giving the other Party sufficient prior
notice of the meeting (including telephonic meetings) and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting (including telephonic meetings). Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ to the contrary, materials provided by
or on behalf of Parent or Buyer to the Company or its counsel or the Company
to Parent or its counsel may be redacted to the extent necessary (a) to remove
references concerning Parents, Buyers or the Companys valuation analyses
with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (b) as necessary to
comply with Contracts in effect on the date hereof, (c) to address reasonable
concerns regarding attorney-client privilege or (d) to remove personal,
proprietary and other confidential business information.

 



45 (d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 5.3_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
consents or approvals from any Persons (other than Governmental Entities) that
are necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any such
third-party consent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, and
shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent and Buyer,
to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
resulting, or which would reasonably be expected to result, after the
Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any
such approval or consent with respect to any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (i) none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required
to, or, without the prior written consent of Parent, shall, pay or commit to
pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such person and (ii) none of Parent, Buyer, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such
person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

 

Section 5.4. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice to the other Party, if to such Partys
Knowledge, (a) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to
expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of
being satisfied by the Outside Date or (b) it fails to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ that (i) nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall be deemed to affect, modify or condition the
obligations of each party to effect the Closing and (ii) any breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall be deemed excluded for purposes of determining
whether the conditions set forth in either _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ have been satisfied, for purposes of termination under
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, and for purposes of any indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

Section 5.5. _Publicity_. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the text of which shall be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company. Following the issuance of such
joint press release, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or public statement with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of the other Party; _provided_ that a Party may, without
obtaining the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation,
to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or
make such public statement as may upon the advice of outside counsel be
required by applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate to develop all public
announcement materials and make appropriate management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
reasonably requested by the other Party, and the Company shall consult with
Parent regarding communications with customers, stockholders and employees
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



46 Section 5.6. _Director_ __ _ and Officer Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Buyer will cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the same
extent required by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted under applicable
Law, all past and present directors and officers of the Company and any
Company Subsidiary (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, a " _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any liabilities,
damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with any Proceeding (whether asserted before
or after the Effective Time) arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time in connection with such Company Indemnified Party
having served as a director or officer of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
or having served at the request of the Company as a director, officer or
employee of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other business, and, to the
same extent that such Company Indemnified Parties have the right to
advancement of expenses from the Company as of the date of this Agreement, to
provide advancement of expenses to any such Company Indemnified Party,
subject to receipt of an undertaking from such Company Indemnified Party to
repay such advanced amounts if it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final judgment that such Company Indemnified Party was not
entitled to indemnification. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or
any successor) to include and maintain in effect, for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, the provisions regarding indemnification and
elimination of liability of directors that are in the Companys Constituent
Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all indemnification agreements with any
Company Indemnified Party in effect as of the date of this Agreement only to
the extent such indemnification agreements are set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.6(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) The Company shall, at or prior to the Closing, at the direction of the
Buyer, purchase tail coverage under the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance policy for the benefit of each Company
Indemnified Party, which provides coverage for period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time with terms and conditions which are not less advantageous
to such Company Indemnified Parties than the terms and conditions of the
existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company.
The expense of such tail coverage shall be a Transaction Expense hereunder.

(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, in each such case to
the extent so required, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
such successor or assign of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.6_.

 



47 (d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties
following the Closing and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification, advancement or contribution that any such
Person may have by Law, Contract or otherwise.

Section 5.7. _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide, to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), until
December 31, 2018, (i) base salary and bonus opportunities (excluding equity
or equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable than those provided
by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those made
available pursuant to employee benefit plans of Parent that are applicable to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its affiliates, while such
Continuing Employees remain employed by the Surviving Corporation or Parent.
Parent will adopt and maintain a retention plan for Continuing Employees on
the terms set forth on _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Parent (x) will give, or cause the Surviving Corporation to give, each
Continuing Employee credit for the Continuing Employees service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to amount of vacation, sick
leave and severance benefits (but not benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan), to the same extent such service was recognized under a
similar Company Benefit Plan, including with respect to providing matching
contributions based on years of service under any 401(k) plan maintained by
the Parent, except in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in
duplicative benefits and (y) will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow
such Continuing Employees to participate in each plan providing
welfare benefits, including medical, life insurance, long-term disability
insurance and long-term care insurance, without regard to preexisting-
condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other
exclusions or limitations not imposed on the Continuing Employee by the
corresponding Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time
and will provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements
under any such plans that may apply after the Closing Date for the calendar
year in which the Continuing Employee begins participation in such plans of
the Parent. All vacation accrued by Continuing Employees under the vacation
policies of the Company or its subsidiaries or predecessors shall be carried
over by Parent at Closing and, after Closing, shall be governed by Parents
applicable vacation policies.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby
expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Continuing
Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except
to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any affiliate of Parent and
the Continuing Employee or any severance, benefit or other applicable plan or
program covering such Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in
this

 



48  Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall (i) be
deemed or construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent, Buyer, or Merger Sub, (ii)
create any third party rights in any Person or (iii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them.

 

(c) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the annual cash
incentive awards applicable to such Continuing Employee for calendar year
2017. The Surviving Corporation will pay to Continuing Employees such 2017
bonus in the ordinary course (and at the time ordinarily paid) based on actual
results for the 2017 fiscal year, _provided_ , that if any Continuing Employee
is involuntarily terminated by the Surviving Corporation without cause prior
to the bonus payment date, a prorated portion of such bonus shall be paid to
such terminated Continuing Employee.

 

(d) The Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions and take such corporate action as is reasonably necessary to
terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), effective as of
the day prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such resolutions and any
documents prepared in connection with such corporate actions prior to the
adoption of such resolutions or taking of such actions. Following the
Effective Time and as soon as practicable following the termination of the
Company 401(k) Plans, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall permit the Continuing
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code), including loans, in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the
full account balance (including loans) distributed to such Continuing
Employees from the Company 401(k) Plans to Parents or the Surviving
Corporations applicable 401(k) plan.

(e) The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
if such communications relate to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, to the extent practicable, shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such communications prior to
distribution.

 

Section 5.8. _280G Stockholder Vote_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall:
(i) use commercially reasonable efforts to secure from each of the Persons
who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
and has received or would reasonably be expected to receive any payments,
rights or benefits which, in the absence of approval by the shareholders in a
manner that complies with Section 280G(5)(B) of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1 (the " _280G Shareholder Approval_ "), would be
deemed to constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code (the
" _Potential 280G Benefits_ "), a waiver of such Persons rights to some or
all of such Potential 280G Benefits (the " _Waived Benefits_ ") so that all
remaining Potential 280G Benefits applicable to such Person shall not be
deemed to be "parachute payments" that would be non-deductible under Section
280G of

  



49  the Code; (ii) solicit the 280G Shareholder Approval of any Waived Benefits;
(iii) prior to seeking any waiver or the 280G Shareholder Approval deliver to
Buyer drafts of such 280G Shareholder Approval related-documents and provide
Buyer a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all calculations,
waivers, consents, disclosures and other documents prepared in connection with
the actions described in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ (the Companys acceptance
of Buyers reasonable comments shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (iv)
not pay the Waived Benefits for which the 280G Shareholder Approval was not
obtained.

 

Section 5.9. _Payoff of Credit_ _Facilities_. The Company shall arrange for
customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge to be delivered at
Closing providing for the payoff, discharge and termination on the Closing
Date of all then-outstanding indebtedness of, and commitments under, the
Credit Facilities, and shall deliver prepayment and termination notices in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Facilities ( _provided_ that such
prepayment and termination notices may be conditional on the occurrence of the
Closing).

 

Section 5.10. _Stockholder Consents_. Following the date that a written
consent evidencing the Company Stockholder Approval is delivered to Parent,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (and deliver to
Parent) consents from each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who did
not execute such written consent evidencing the Company Stockholder Approval,
evidencing such holders waiver of all appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL and such holders approval of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.12_
(Stockholder Representative) as it relates to such holder. The Company shall
send such notices and information to the holders of Company Capital Stock as
may be required under its Constituent Documents and applicable Law and shall
provide drafts of such materials to Parent and Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity prior to the expected mailing or distribution date for Parents
and Buyers review and comment and the Companys acceptance of reasonable
comments from Parent or Buyer shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

Section 5.11. _Exclusivity_. On and after the date of this Agreement and
through the Closing (or the earlier termination of this Agreement), the
Company and its Affiliates shall not, and the Company shall cause its
directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives to not,
directly or indirectly (i) take any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Person (other than Parent, Buyer,
Merger Sub and their respective representatives) concerning any merger or
recapitalization involving the Company, sale of five percent or more of the
capital stock of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, or five percent or
more of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (measured based on either book value or fair market value), or similar
transaction.

Section 5.12. _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested in
writing by Parent and Buyer in connection with Parent and/or Buyer arranging
debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which debt financing may be incurred before or following the
Closing (the " _Debt Financing_ "), including all cooperation reasonably
requested to enable Parent, Buyer and their Representatives to prepare
financial statements,

 



50  including pro forma financial statements, in compliance with applicable SEC
requirements for use in a registered or unregistered offering of debt
securities in connection with such Debt Financing and to enable accountants
of Parent and/or the Company to audit or review such financial statements,
including, if requested by Parent, using reasonable best efforts to (x)
provide a customary representation letter in such form as is
reasonably required by accountants of Parent and/or the Company, as
applicable, with such facts and assumptions as reasonably determined by such
accountants in order to make such certificate accurate, signed by the
individual(s) responsible for the Companys financial reporting, as
prescribed by generally accepted auditing standards as promulgated by the
Auditing Standards Divisions of the American Institute of Public Accountants
in order to enable an independent public accountant to render an opinion on
such financial statements, (y) cause the auditor of the Companys financial
statements to provide its consent to the inclusion of such report, without
exception or qualification, with respect to the Audited Financial Statements
in any offering document of the Parent or Buyer or any report of the Parent or
Buyer filed with the SEC, and (z) to provide to Parent and its underwriters,
or the equivalent in an unregistered offering of securities,
appropriate comfort letters in accordance with the American Institute of
Public Accountants professional standards and to participate in due diligence
sessions customarily conducted in connection with the provision of comfort
letters. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Buyer the Companys unaudited
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, and the related
statements of income or operations for the three- and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2017 as soon as reasonably practicable following the end
of the Companys third quarter of 2017 period but in no event later than
October 30, 2017.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or pay or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses in
connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, (B)
enter into any definitive agreement, document or instrument with respect to
the Debt Financing contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.12_, (C) give any
indemnities with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.12_ that are effective prior to the Effective Time, (D) take any action
with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ that,
in the good faith determination of the Company, would unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (E) provide any information the
disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable Laws or is
legally privileged ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the Parties agree to
collaborate in good faith to make alternative arrangements to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a violation of Law
or loss of privilege), or (F) take any action that will conflict with or
violate its organizational documents or any applicable Laws or would result in
a violation or breach of, or default under, any Contract to which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require (A) any
officer or Representative of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to
(x) execute or deliver any definitive agreement, certificate, document,
instrument or opinion in connection with the Debt Financing that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time, or (y) take any other action pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ that could reasonably be expected to result in
personal liability to such officer or Representative or that would be
effective prior to the Effective Time, or (B) the members of the Company Board
as of the date hereof to approve the Debt Financing or any alternative
financing or Contracts related thereto.

 



51 (c) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such information
to any Debt Financing sources and other financial institutions and investors
that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the Debt Financing
(and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a beneficiary.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated, upon request by the Company, Parent and
Buyer shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days of
invoice) reimburse the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with providing
the cooperation contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ to the extent such
expenses were in excess of the expenses the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries would have incurred in the absence of the cooperation obligations
in _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_.

 

(e) Parent and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Representatives, from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, costs or expenses
(including legal fees and expenses), awards, judgments, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Debt Financing, including providing the support and cooperation contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than written information provided by or on behalf of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
for use in connection with the Debt Financing).

(f) Parent, Buyer and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree that (i) the
obtaining of (or failure to obtain) the Debt Financing or any other financing
is not a condition to the Closing; (ii) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not be delayed or postponed as a result
of the obtaining of (or failure to obtain) the Debt Financing, and (iii) it
shall continue to be obligated to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt
Financing or any other financing.

(g) Any breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall be deemed excluded for
purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in either _Section_
__ _ 6.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ have been satisfied, for purposes of
termination under _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_, and for purposes of any
indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_.

 



52 Section 5.13. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) For any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, Buyer shall timely prepare or cause to be prepared
and shall file or cause to be filed with the appropriate taxing authorities
all Tax Returns required to be filed; _provided_ that Buyer shall permit the
Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
prior to the filing thereof, and Buyer shall not file any such Tax Return
without the prior written approval of the Stockholder Representative, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer shall pay all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns described in the preceding
sentence; _provided_ that any such amounts shall be released to Buyer from the
Indemnity Escrow Funds to the extent required under  _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(iii)_.

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be:

(i) In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or,
in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) In the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed
in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be
determined as if such Tax period ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions), other than with respect to property placed in service after the
Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis.

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, the taxable year of the
Company that includes the Closing Date shall close, and in any event shall be
treated as Closing, at the end of the day on the Closing Date for all income
Tax purposes, and all income Tax Returns shall be filed consistently with the
foregoing.

 

(d) In the event that Parent delivers a Deferral Notice pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.2(b)_, any deductions arising from the payment of the Closing Date
Aggregate Option Payment Amount, any other compensatory payments arising from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of Transaction
Expenses, in each case made at or substantially contemporaneous with the
Closing, shall be treated as having been paid on the Satisfaction Date for
purposes of calculating the Buyer Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(e) Parent, Buyer, the Company, each of the Company Subsidiaries and the
Stockholder Representative shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and other
representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with 

 



53  respect to all periods relating to Taxes, including by maintaining and
making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information or explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(f) Without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to (i) make,
change or rescind any Tax election with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) amend any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iii) file any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period in a
jurisdiction in which the Company did not file previously (unless Buyer
reasonably determines that such filing is necessary based on a change in
circumstances occurring after the taxable period in respect of any previously
filed Tax Return), (iv) engage in any voluntary disclosure or similar process
with any taxing authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (v)
extend the statute of limitations with respect to any Tax with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (vi) take any other action with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, in each case that would reasonably be expected to have
the effect of increasing the liability of the former holders of Company
Capital Stock or Company Options for Taxes pursuant to _Article VIII_ of this
Agreement.

 

(g) _Tax Claims_.

 

(i) With respect to any claim for indemnification for a breach of a
representation or warranty contained in  _Section_ __ _ 3.12_ or a covenant
contained in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(o)_ or under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(iii)_ (a
" _Tax Claim_ ") relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Stockholder
Representative shall, solely at the cost and expense of the holders of shares
of Company Capital Stock, control all proceedings and may make all decisions
taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without limiting the foregoing,
may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative
appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with
respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed
or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Stockholder Representative must first consult, in good faith with
Buyer before taking any action with respect to the conduct of such Tax Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall not settle
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and Buyer, and counsel
of its own choosing, shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects
of the prosecution or defense of such Tax Claim if it reasonably determines
that such Tax Claim could have a material adverse impact on the Taxes of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in a Tax period or portion
thereof beginning after the Closing Date.

(ii) Buyer shall control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax
Claim relating to Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a
Straddle Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not settle such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

obtain the resignation of all of the members of the board of directors of the
Company (and of the board of directors or similar governing body for each

the Closing.

their Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and other Representatives (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") shall
be indemnified and held harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred
or suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party, arising out of, or resulting from:

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Company
as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as if made on and

whom Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries otherwise joins or has ever

(b) The sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with
respect to indemnification under  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ of this Agreement

to satisfy such indemnification obligation, by release of Indemnity Escrow

second, by reducing any Milestone Payment dollar-for-dollar by the amount of
such indemnification obligation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_.
Other than with respect to actual fraud or with respect to matters for which
the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary
equitable remedies are available, the sole and exclusive remedy of all parties
from and after the Closing with respect to any breach of this Agreement shall
be limited to this _Article VIII_. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be
entitled to indemnification for any Losses that are in the nature of punitive
or special damages (except to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party pays to
any third party any such damages) and, in calculating the amount of any
Losses, no methodology related to the "diminution in value" of the Company
shall be used.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.2(a)(i)_ until (A) with respect to any given claim for Losses, such claim is
individually in excess of $50,000 (the " _Individual Basket Amount_ ") (it
being understood that the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover for the full
amount of such Losses once the claim exceeds such Individual Basket Amount),
and (B) the aggregate Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to
indemnification claims pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_ that
individually exceed the Individual Basket Amount exceeds on a cumulative basis
an amount equal to $3,000,000; _provided_ that, in each case of clauses (A)
and (B), the foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to breaches of
or inaccuracies in the Specified Representations of the Company.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification arising out of any Losses
(i) for any Taxes arising in any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date attributable to a breach of the representations in
_Section_ __ _ 3.12_ other than the representation in _Section_ __ _
3.12(e)_, or _(i)_ , (ii) based on the amount or availability of any Tax asset
or attribute (e.g., any net operating loss carryover or tax credit carryover)
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the ability of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries to utilize any such Tax asset or attribute for any taxable period
commencing on or after the Closing or (iii) for Taxes arising from actions of
Buyer or its Affiliates on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the
ordinary course of business.

 



60 (e) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify each holder of shares of
Company Capital Stock (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnified
Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to (A) any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub
as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as if made on and
as of such date; _provided_ that for purposes of determining both (i) the
amount of any Losses and (ii) whether there has been any such breach or
inaccuracy, any qualifications as to materiality or Parent Material Adverse
Effect or similar qualifiers shall be disregarded and (B) any breach of or
failure by Parent, Buyer or Merger Sub to perform, or cause to be performed,
any of the covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement.

(f) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses claimed under this _Article VIII_ upon Buyer becoming aware of such
Losses.

(g) The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ will be net of any reduction in taxes actually
realized (determined on a "with or without" basis) by a Buyer Indemnified
Party (as determined in its reasonable discretion exercised in good faith) by
reason of payment of such obligation or liability (taking into account any tax
cost or reduction in such tax benefits by reason of receipt of the
indemnification payment) and any amounts of any insurance proceeds, other
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received (net of any deductibles and the costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such proceeds, payments or reimbursements) by the Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to such Losses or any of the circumstances giving rise
thereto, which the Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Buyer is entitled to claims or payments in
respect of the same factual circumstances under more than one provision of
this Agreement, it will only be entitled to recover indemnification for any
specific Loss once under the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.3. _Procedure for Indemnification_.

 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall, in the case of a Buyer Indemnified Party, promptly notify in writing
the Stockholder Representative and, in the case of a Seller Indemnified Party,
promptly notify in writing the Buyer (any such notice, a " _Notice of Claim_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of any Indemnified
Party in providing such notice shall adversely affect the rights of the
Indemnified Party under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_. The Notice of Claim shall set
forth in reasonable detail (i) the date and nature and basis of such claim and
(ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of such claim. The Indemnified Party
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Stockholder
Representative or the Buyer, as the case may be, in relation to such claim.

(b) If a claim for indemnification is with respect to a Proceeding by a
third-party against an Indemnified Party, the Stockholder Representative, in
the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party and Buyer, in the case of a
claim by a Seller Indemnified Party (the Stockholder Representative or Buyer,
as applicable, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), shall be entitled (but not
obligated) to defend the Indemnified Party against such Proceeding with
counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the reasonable
approval of the Indemnified Party) at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense; _provided_ _however_ that prior to assuming such control of the
Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing that it
is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Proceeding to the extent provided for in,

 



61  and subject to the limitations of, this _Article VIII_. The Indemnifying
Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to such Proceeding without the prior written consent
of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless the judgment or proposed settlement (i) involves only the
payment of money damages against which the Indemnified Party is indemnified
in full by release of Indemnity Escrow Funds at the time of such settlement,
(ii) releases the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates from all liability or
obligation in connection with such Proceeding, (iii) does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates and (iv) does not involve a finding or admission of any violation
of applicable Law or other wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such a
Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall, at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost
and expense, cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party
and its attorneys in such defense. In any such Proceeding, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at its own expense unless representation of
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel
would represent a conflict of interest for such counsel under applicable
standards of professional conduct for attorneys, in which case the
Indemnifying Party will pay (including through release of Indemnity Escrow
Funds to make such payments) the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel. This _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall not apply to any Tax Claim, which
shall be governed by _Section_ __ _ 5.13_.

 

Section 8.4. _Release of Funds from Escrow and Offset of Milestone Payments_.

 

(a) Any indemnification payment that a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be paid, to the extent there are
sufficient Indemnity Escrow Funds, by release of Indemnity Escrow Funds to
such Buyer Indemnified Party by the Escrow Agent within five Business Days
after the date notice of such proposed release is given to both the
Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent, except if the Stockholder
Representative delivers a written objection to Buyer (with a copy to the
Escrow Agent) objecting to such release, in which case Indemnity Escrow Funds
shall only be released upon the final resolution of such objection (either
pursuant to agreement between Buyer and the Stockholder Representatives or by
an Order from a court of competent jurisdiction ordering the release of such
funds by the Escrow Agent).

 

(b) On the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release the remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds (to the extent not
utilized to pay for any indemnification claims hereunder) for disbursement to
the former holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Warrants and Company
Options as set forth below, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain all or a
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds then held by the Escrow Agent in an
amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the outstanding claims for
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ asserted prior to the such date but
not yet resolved (" _Unresolved Claims_ "). If there are any remaining
Indemnity Escrow Funds after satisfaction of all indemnity claims (including
Unresolved Claims) under this _Article VIII_ , Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release (1) to the
Paying Agent an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Release Per Share Payment
owed, with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock and Company
Warrants, to the former holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and
Company Warrants and (2) to the Company an amount equal to

 



62  the aggregate Indemnity Escrow Release Per Share Payment owed, with respect
to all Company Options, to the former holders of Company Options. The Paying
Agent shall promptly disburse the funds received pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.4(b)_ to the former holders of Company Capital Stock and Company
Warrants and the Company shall promptly disburse, through the Companys
payroll (or by check for any holder who is not a current employee of the
Company), the funds received pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ to the
former holders of Company Options, in each case in accordance with _Article
II_.

 

(c) In the event there are any claims for indemnification by a Buyer
Indemnified Party that are for an amount greater than the then-
remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds (such claims, " _Offset Claims_ " and the
aggregate amount of such Offset Claims minus the then-remaining Indemnity
Escrow Funds, the " _Aggregate Offset Amount_ "), if any Milestone Payment
would otherwise become due following the time such Offset Claims have been
made, such Milestone Payment shall be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the
Aggregate Offset Amount and if the Aggregate Offset Amount is greater than
such Milestone Payment, any further Milestone Payments that would otherwise
become due following such time shall also be reduced dollar-for-dollar until
and to the extent the Milestone Payments that would otherwise have become due
have been reduced, in the aggregate, by amount equal to the Aggregate Offset
Amount. In the event all Offset Claims are finally resolved (either pursuant
to agreement between Parent and the Stockholder Representatives or by a final,
non-appealable order from a court of competent jurisdiction) for an amount
(the aggregate amount for all Offset Claims, the " _Offset Final Resolution
Amount_ ") that is less than the Aggregate Offset Amount, then Buyer shall

equal to the aggregate Offset Claims Per Share Payment owed, with respect to
all shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants, to the former
holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants and (2) with

owed, with respect to all Company Options, to the former holders of Company

and Company Warrants and the Company shall promptly disburse, through the
Companys payroll (or by check for any holder who is not a current employee
of the Company), the funds received pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_
to the former holders of Company Options, in each case in accordance with
_Article II_.

 

(d) " _Offset Claims Per Share Payment_ " means an amount equal to the
quotient of (A) (i) the Aggregate Offset Amount minus (ii) the Offset Final
Resolution Amount _divided by_ (B) the then-applicable Fully Diluted Share
Number.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Milestone Payments shall
not be reduced by more than $36,250,000 as a result of indemnification claims
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(i)_; _provided_ that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to breaches of or
inaccuracies in the Specified Representations of the Company.

 



63 (f) The Parties shall treat any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_  as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for income Tax
purposes.

or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions,

effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as
the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party
hereto.

Section 9.12. _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholder
Approval, and without any further action of any of the holders of Company
Capital Stock or the Company, Shareholder Representative Services LLC is
hereby irrevocably nominated, constituted and appointed as the exclusive
representative, agent and true and lawful attorney in fact of holders of
Company Capital Stock (the " _Stockholder Representative_ "), with full power
of substitution (and, if substituted, the Stockholder Representative will
promptly notify Parent and Buyer of such substitution) to act in the name,
place and stead of the holders of Company Capital Stock with respect to this
Agreement, as the same may be from time to time amended, and with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to do or refrain from doing all such
acts and things, and to execute all such documents, as the Stockholder
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with this
Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Stockholder Representatives is hereby authorized to take
all actions on behalf of the holders of Company Capital Stock in connection
with any actions taken or to be taken under _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,  _Section_
__ _ 2.6_ and _Article VIII_.

(b) All decisions and actions of the Stockholder Representative shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the holders of Company Capital Stock and
may be relied upon by Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates as the decisions and
actions of the holders of Company Capital Stock. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable to any of the holders of Company Capital
Stock for any act done or omitted by the Stockholder Representative in good
faith pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement ancillary hereto or any
mistake of fact or Law unless caused by the Stockholder Representatives
willful misconduct in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. The
holders of shares of Company Capital Stock will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Stockholder Representative from and against any and all losses,

 



67  liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees,
costs and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and
their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such
Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event
that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly
caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the holders of
shares of Company Capital Stock the amount of such indemnified Representative
Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the
holders of shares of Company Capital Stock, any such Representative Losses may
be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Stockholder Representative Expense Funds, (ii) the amounts in the Indemnity
Escrow Funds and Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock, and (iii) from any Milestone Payments at such time as
any such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock; _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Stockholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock
from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of
the holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on
liability or indemnification obligations of the holders of shares of Company
Capital Stock set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Stockholder Representative
under this Section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of
this Agreement. In taking any action or refraining from taking any action
whatsoever the Stockholder Representative shall be protected in relying upon
any notice, paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine,
or upon any evidence reasonably deemed by it to be sufficient. The
Stockholder Representative may consult with counsel in connection with its
duties and shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered or permitted by
it in good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.

 

(c) The holders of shares of Company Capital Stock will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Stockholder Representative Expense Funds and
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative any
ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Stockholder Representative Expense Funds other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. For tax purposes, the Stockholder Representative
Expense Funds will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Companys shareholders at the time of Closing. If there are any
Stockholder Representative Expense Funds remaining following the payment by
the Stockholder Representative of all costs and expenses that may
be reasonably expected to be incurred by the Stockholder Representative, in
its capacity

 



68  as such, in connection the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at
such time the Stockholder Representative shall deposit (a) with the Paying
Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Stockholder Representative Unused
Funds Per Share Payment owed, with respect to all shares of Company Capital
Stock, to the former holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and (b) with
the Surviving Corporation an amount equal to the aggregate Stockholder
Representative Unused Funds Per Share Payment owed, with respect to all
Company Options, to the former holders of Company Options. The Paying Agent
shall promptly disburse the funds received pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
9.12(c)_ to the former holders of Company Capital Stock and the Company shall
promptly disburse, through the Companys payroll (or by check for any holder
who is not a current employee of the Company), the funds received pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.12(c)_ to the former holders of Company Options, in
each case in accordance with _Article II_.

 

Section 9.13. _Legal Representation_

 

(a) Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati (" _WSGR_ ") has acted as counsel for the
securityholders, the Company (prior to and including the Effective Time) and
the Stockholder Representative (collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in
connection with the transaction documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby (the " _Acquisition Engagement_ ") and, in that
connection, not as counsel for any other Person, including, without
limitation, Parent, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation). Only the Company Parties shall be considered clients of WSGR in
the Acquisition Engagement. If the Stockholder Representative so desires, WSGR
shall be permitted, without the need for any future waiver or consent, to
represent any of the securityholders or the Stockholder Representative after
the Closing in connection with any matter related to the matters contemplated
by any of the transaction documents or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto and may in connection therewith represent the Representatives or
Affiliates of the securityholders and the Stockholder Representative, in any
of the foregoing cases including, without limitation, in any action, dispute,
litigation or other adversary proceeding against, with or involving Parent,
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Representatives or
Affiliates.

(b) To the extent that communications between a Company Party, on the one
hand, and WSGR, on the other hand, relate to the Acquisition Engagement, such
communication shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong
solely to the Stockholder Representative, for and on behalf of the
secuityholders. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates, including the Buyer
and Surviving Corporation, shall have access to (and Parent hereby waives, on
behalf of each, any right of access it may otherwise have with respect to) any
such communications or the files or work product of WSGR, to the extent that
they relate to the Acquisition Engagement, whether or not the Closing occurs.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and
agrees, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, including the Surviving
Corporation, upon and after the Closing: (i) the Stockholder Representative,
for and on behalf of the securityholders, and WSGR shall be the sole holders
of the attorney-client privilege of the Company Parties with respect to the
Acquisition Engagement, and neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates,
including the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, shall be a holder thereof;
(ii) to the extent that files or work product of WSGR in respect of the
Acquisition Engagement constitute property of a client of WSGR, only the
Stockholder Representative, for and on behalf of the securityholders, shall
hold such property rights of any Company Parties and have the right to waive
or modify such property rights; and (iii) WSGR 

 



69  shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications, files or work product to Parent or any of its Affiliates,
including the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation, by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between WSGR and the Company Parties or otherwise;
_provided_ that, to the extent any communication is both related and unrelated
to the Acquisition Engagement, WSGR shall provide (and the Stockholder
Representative, for and on behalf of the other Company Parties, shall instruct
WSGR to provide) appropriately redacted versions of such communications, files
or work product to Parent or its Affiliates, including the Buyer and
the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between any of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or
their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the secuityholders or the
Stockholder Representative, on the other hand, concerning the matters
contemplated in any of the transaction documents, Parent, for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates and the Buyer, Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates, agrees that Parent, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates shall not offer into evidence or otherwise attempt to use or assert
the foregoing attorney-client communications, files or work product against
the Stockholder Representative or the securityholders.

 

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing, any other communication between a
Company Party, on the one hand, and any Representative of a Company Party
(other than WSGR) or any other third person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), prior to the Closing and relating to the Acquisition Engagement
shall be deemed confidential information of the securityholders, and from and
after the Closing, such communications shall be deemed to be confidential
information that belong solely to the Stockholder Representative, for and on
behalf of the securityholders. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall be
entitled to transfer possession of such communications (including any
tangible and intangible copies of such communications) to the Stockholder
Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between any of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any of the securityholders or the Stockholder
Representative, on the other hand, concerning the matters contemplated in any
of the transaction documents Parent, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates and the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates,
agrees that Parent, the Buyer the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates
shall not offer into evidence or otherwise attempt to use or assert the
foregoing communications against the Stockholder Representative or the
securityholders.

more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
