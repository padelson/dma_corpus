Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a Straddle Period shall
be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending immediately

applicable, the parties shall utilize the most recent information
available in estimating the amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such
adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount
thereof paid or economically borne by a party) is ultimately determined to be
different than the amount (if any) that was taken into account in the final
settlement of the Adjusted Purchase Price, timely payments will be made from

business reason of Seller, including in order for Seller to comply with a Tax
or other legally required reporting obligation or Tax or legal dispute. Any
such access shall be at the sole cost and expense of Seller. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Seller, for a period of ten (10) years following
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not and shall cause its Affiliates, its
permitted transferees, designees and assigns hereunder not to destroy, alter

ownership and operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time (except for
any Property Costs with respect to the Purchaser Benefit Operations), (ii)
Property Costs or other costs (other than Asset Taxes, Income Taxes and
Transfer Taxes) attributable to any Seller Operations prior to the Effective
Time, or (iii) capital expenditures attributable to any Seller Operations at
or after the Effective Time, in each case, that are paid by Purchaser; and

 

(q) Reduced by an amount equal to all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons
relating to the Assets and payable to owners of Working Interests, royalties,
overriding royalties and other similar interests (in each case) that are held

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to the exclusions set forth in this paragraph, in determining the
Closing Payment, if the aggregate amount of all adjustments pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2_ (calculated by netting all upward adjustments against all
downward adjustments under this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, but excluding all
direct adjustments to the principal amount of the Purchaser Note pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(d)(iii)_, _4.4(k)_ , _5.3(b)_ or _8.6(c)_ ) is (x)
positive, then the Cash Consideration included in the Closing Payment shall
be increased by such positive amount, or (y) negative, then the principal
amount of the Purchaser Note shall be reduced by the absolute value of such
negative amount. All adjustments pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ shall
be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes.

 

Section 3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Allocated Values assigned to
the Wells, DSUs and Assumed Hedges are set forth in _Schedule 3.3_. Purchaser
and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation

Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder
and, to the extent allowed under applicable federal income tax Law, in a
manner consistent with the Allocated Values, within thirty (30) days after
the Final Settlement Date (the " _Allocation_ "). If Seller and Purchaser
reach an agreement with respect to the Allocation, (a) Purchaser and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) Purchaser and Seller shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, report consistently with the
Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns, including Internal Revenue

inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither party shall be unreasonably impeded in its ability
and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax audit, claim or
similar proceedings in connection with such allocation.

TITLE MATTERS

 

Section 4.1 Sellers Title.

 

(a) Except for the special warranty of Defensible Title as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_ and without limiting Purchasers rights with respect
to Sellers breach of its representations and warranties in _Sections 6.6_ ,
_6.12_ , _6.19_ and _6.20_ (the " _Applicable Seller Representations_
"), SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO SELLERS TITLE TO ANY OF THE ASSETS AND
PURCHASER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT PURCHASERS SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY
DEFECT OF TITLE, INCLUDING ANY TITLE DEFECT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE ASSETS
SHALL BE PURSUANT TO THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THIS _ARTICLE 4_.

 

(b) The Conveyance shall contain a special warranty of Defensible Title to
the Assets by Seller unto Purchaser against every Person whomsoever lawfully
claiming by, through and under Seller and its Affiliates, but not otherwise,
subject, however, to the Permitted Encumbrances. Except for the limited
special warranty referenced in the preceding sentence, no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
Sellers title to any of the Assets shall be contained in the assignment and
conveyance documents substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_
to be delivered by Seller to Purchaser at Closing (the " _Conveyance_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title
Defect under this _Article 4_ results from any matter which could also result
in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
_Article 6_ (other than any Applicable Seller Representation, which shall not
be limited under this clause (c)), then Purchaser shall only be entitled to
assert such matter as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this _Article
4_ , and shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of
the breach of any representation or warranty.

Section 4.2 Definitions of Title Matters. As used in this Agreement, the
term " _Defensible Title_ " means that title of Seller with respect to the
Wells and DSUs set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit B-2_ that, as of the
Title Claim Date and the Closing Date, and subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances, is deducible of record (whether in the applicable county records
or the records of any other Governmental Body issuing any Leases) or, where
not deducible of record is evidenced and/or established by any applicable
unrecorded assignments, contracts or instruments, including any applicable
joint operating agreements, pooling agreements, 

 



26

    

 unitization agreements, authorizations for expenditures, joint interest
billings and/or non-consent elections:

 

(a) entitles Seller to receive an interest (expressed as a percentage or
decimal fraction) of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from any
Wells and DSUs set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ limited to the
applicable Formation of such Well or DSU (after satisfaction of all
royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons) (a " _Net Revenue
Interest_ "), of not less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in  _Exhibit
B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ for such Well or DSU, except (solely to the extent that
such actions do not cause a breach of Sellers covenants under  _Section_ __
_ 8.5_) for (i) decreases in connection with those operations in which Seller
may from and after the Effective Time become a non-consenting co-owner or
non-consenting party, (ii) decreases resulting from the establishment or
amendment from and after the Effective Time of pools or units, (iii)
decreases required to allow other Working Interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries and/or (iv) as
stated in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit  B-2_;

(b) obligates Seller to bear not more than the Working Interest in any
Wells or DSUs set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ limited to the
applicable Formation of such Well or DSU not greater than the Working
Interest shown in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ for such Well or DSU, except
(i) as stated in _Exhibit B-1_ or  _Exhibit B-2_, (ii) for increases
resulting from contribution requirements arising from and after the Effective
Time with respect to non-consenting or defaulting co-owners under applicable
operating agreements or pooling orders and/or (iii) for increases that are
accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue
Interest; and

 

(c) with respect to the applicable Formation, is free and clear of liens,
encumbrances, obligations, security interests, irregularities, pledges, or
other defects, in each case other than the Permitted Encumbrances.

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Defect_ " means any lien,
charge, encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation), defect
(including those contemplated by clause (c) above), or other matter (including
without limitation a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or Working Interest)
that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title in and to the Wells and DSUs
set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ and _Exhibit  B-2_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the following shall not be considered Title Defects, _provided_ that Sellers
revenues related to any Well are not currently being held in suspense related
to any such matters:

(i) defects arising out of lack of corporate or similar entity
authorization unless Purchaser provides affirmative written evidence that the
action was not authorized and results in another Persons superior claim of
title;

 

(ii) defects based on failure to record Leases issued by any local, Indian,
state or federal Governmental Body, or any assignments of such Leases, in the
real property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such
Property is located, _provided_ that failures to record any such Leases or any
assignments of interests in such Leases in the applicable public record may
be defects if the failure to so record cannot be cured by filing the same
after the Effective Time in the applicable public record;

 



27

    

(iii) defects based on a gap in Sellers chain of title in the federal,
state or county records as to Leases, unless such gap is affirmatively shown
to exist in such records by an abstract of title, title opinion or landmans
title chain which documents shall be included in a Title Defect Notice and
such gap is not the result of the failure of any applicable Governmental Body
to approve any assignment into Purchaser or any of its predecessor in interest
(but only to the extent any such assignment has been delivered and submitted
to such Governmental Body and such Governmental Body has not affirmatively
rejected any such assignment in writing);

 

(iv) defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite
marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or
estate proceedings, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such
failure or omission has resulted in another Persons superior claim of title;

 

(v) defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitation or
prescription;

 

(vi) defects or depth severances that pertain to any formation or common
source of supply other than the Formation applicable to the subject Well or
DSU;

(vii) immaterial defects or irregularities resulting from or related to
probate proceedings, which defects or irregularities have been outstanding for
ten (10) years or more;

 

(viii) defects arising from prior oil and gas leases relating to lands
covered by any Leases that are not released of record and that have expired
on the face of the terms of such instrument, unless Purchaser provides
affirmative written evidence that such failure or omission results in another
Persons superior claim of title;

 

(ix) any maintenance of uniform interest provision under any joint
operating agreement (including any past violations of such provisions);

(x) defects based solely on (A) lack of information, including lack of
information in Sellers files, the lack of third party records or the
unavailability of information from any Governmental Body, (B) references to a
document(s) if such document(s) is not in Sellers files or (C) any Tax
assessment, Tax payment or similar records or the absence of such activities
or records;

 

(xi) defects arising out of lack of survey or lack of metes and bounds
descriptions, unless a survey or metes and bounds description is expressly
required by Law;

(xii) defects arising from any change in applicable Law after the date
hereof;

 



28

    

(xiii) defects arising from any prior oil and gas lease relating to the
lands covered by a Lease not being surrendered of record, unless Purchaser
provides affirmative evidence that the primary term thereof has not expired or
a third party is conducting operations on, asserting ownership of, or has a
claim of superior title to, the Assets;

(xiv) defects that affect only which royalty owner has the right to
receive royalty payments rather than the amount or the proper payment of such
royalty payment;

 

(xv) any lien, mortgage, security interest, pledge, charge or other
encumbrance or of loss of title resulting from, (i) Sellers conduct of
business as required by the terms of this Agreement (other than, and
specifically excluding, _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)(i)_), (ii) Sellers conduct of
business as directed, or consented to, by Purchaser under this Agreement, or
(iii) omissions or failures to act of Seller where such omissions or failures
to act (A) are required under this Agreement, (B) occurred at the direction of
Purchaser, or (C) occurred due to Purchasers failure to consent to any
activity;

(xvi) any defects or irregularities resulting from liens, production
payments or mortgages, including failure to record releases of such, that have
expired on their own terms, unless the same results in another Persons actual
and superior claim of title to the relevant Lease or Well, or the enforcement
of which are barred by applicable statutes of limitation;

 

(xvii) the absence of any lease amendment or consent by any royalty,
overriding royalty or mineral interest holder authorizing the pooling of any
leasehold interest, royalty, overriding royalty or mineral interest if any
such leasehold interest owner, royalty or overriding royalty owner or mineral
interest owner is not required to ratify such Unit (because, in each case,
such interest can be pooled or unitized without such owners consent);

 

(xviii) defects arising from any Lease having a provision that restricts or
prohibits pooling, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such
provision has been violated with respect to the Wells; and

 

(xix) such other defects or irregularities in the title to the Assets that
would be accepted by a reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business
of owning and operating oil and gas properties in the region where the Assets
are located.

 

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " means any right,
circumstance or condition that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest
of Seller in any Well or DSU set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_
(limited to the applicable Formation of such Well or DSU), without causing a
greater than proportionate increase in Sellers Working Interest above that
shown in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_.

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect prior to Closing, Purchaser must
deliver a claim notice to Seller (each a " _Title Defect Notice_ ") on or
before 60 days after the date of this

 



32

    

 Agreement at 5:00 p.m. Central Time (the " _Title Claim Date_ "). To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Wells or DSUs affected
by the Title Defect (each a " _Title Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) to the extent available,
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title
attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the existence of and extent of
the alleged Title Defect(s) and the amount by which the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v)
the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each
Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations and information upon which Purchasers belief is based. To give
Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects,
Purchaser agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, at the end of every
two week period prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all alleged
Title Defects discovered by or on behalf of Purchaser during the preceding two
week period, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior
to the Title Claim Date; _provided_ that the failure to provide any such
preliminary notice shall not affect Purchasers right to assert Title Defects
at any time prior to or on the Title Claim Date. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, SUBJECT TO THE SPECIAL WARRANTY
OF DEFENSIBLE TITLE IN THE CONVEYANCE AND PURCHASERS REMEDIES FOR THE
BREACHES OF THE APPLICABLE SELLER REPRESENTATIONS, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED
TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ASSERT TITLE DEFECTS OF WHICH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN
GIVEN NOTICE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS _SECTION 4.4(a)_ ON OR BEFORE
THE TITLE CLAIM DATE. For purposes hereof, the " _Allocated Value_ " of an
Asset means the portion of the Total Allocated Value that has been allocated
to a particular Well or DSU in _Schedule 3.3_ as prepared by Purchaser and
reviewed for reasonableness by Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall be entitled to waive or rescind any
Title Defect asserted in a Title Defect Notice at any point in time prior to
or on the Closing Date, and any such waived or rescinded Title Defects will
become Permitted Encumbrances and will not be included in the calculations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ or  _9.2(e)_.

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date, with respect to each Title
Benefit, a notice (a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") including (i) a description
of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Wells or DSUs affected, (iii) the Allocated
Values of the Well or DSU set forth in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ subject
to such Title Benefit, and (iv) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes
the Allocated Value of those Wells or DSUs is increased by the Title Benefit,
and the computations and information upon which Sellers belief is based.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, SELLER
SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED ITS RIGHT TO ASSERT TITLE BENEFITS OF WHICH
PURCHASER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN NOTICE ON OR BEFORE THE TITLE CLAIM DATE.

 

(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost and expense, to cure or remove Title Defects at any time prior to
Closing (the " _Cure Period_ "), unless the parties otherwise agree, any Title
Defects of which Seller has been advised in writing by Purchaser. Any asserted
Title Defects which are cured within the Cure Period or waived or deemed
waived by Purchaser shall be deemed Permitted Encumbrances hereunder.

 



33

    

(d) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured
on or before Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall mutually agree to have one of
the following remedies apply:

 

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and Defect Deductible,
have the Purchase Price reduced by an amount (" _Title Defect Amount_ ")
agreed upon pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_ by Purchaser and Seller as
being the value of such Title Defect, taking into consideration the Allocated
Value of the Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion of the
Property subject to such Title Defect and the legal effect of such Title
Defect on the Property affected thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
methodology, terms and conditions of _Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_ shall control
any such determination;

(ii) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser against all liability, loss, cost
and expense resulting from such Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity
agreement mutually acceptable to the parties; or

 

(iii) Seller shall convey of the Property that is subject to such Title
Defect to Purchaser at Closing, and the principal amount of the Purchaser
Note shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Amount as set
forth in the Title Defect Notice delivered by Purchaser for such Title Defect.
Thereafter, Seller shall have 180 days after Closing in which to cure such
Title Defect. In the event that Seller is able to cure such Title Defect by
the end of this 180 day cure period, then the principal amount of the
Purchaser Note as of the Effective Time shall be increased by the amount equal
to the Title Defect Amount for such cured Title Defect and Seller shall be
entitled to any interest accruing on such amount under the Purchaser Note from
and after the Effective Time. An election pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
4.4(d)(iii)_ shall not waive Sellers right to dispute the existence of a
Title Defect or to contest the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect
thereto. In the event that Seller is unable to cure the Title Defect within
180 days of the Closing, then the Parties shall select the remedy set forth in
subsection (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.4(d)_. Should Purchasers choice
ultimately lead to application of  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_, the Title Expert
shall be selected within fifteen (15) Business Days of the end of this 180 day
cure period. All other provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_ shall apply as
written.

 

In the event that Purchaser and Seller fail to agree upon one of the foregoing
remedies with respect to a Title Defect asserted by Purchaser pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(a)_ prior to Closing, then the remedy set forth in clause
(iii) shall apply as the remedy for such Title Defect, and if the parties
cannot agree on whether any Title Defect that has been asserted
actually constitutes a Title Defect and as a result the parties cannot agree
whether the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.2(e)_
have been satisfied as of Closing, then the parties shall cause such dispute
to be resolved prior to the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_
in order to determine whether such conditions have been satisfied. In the
event the parties select the remedy set forth in clause (i) above, and
Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the Title Defect Amount, the
affected Assets will nevertheless be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing with a
reduction in the Purchase Price for such Title Defect based upon the Title
Defect Amount asserted by Purchaser, subject to Sellers right to a
subsequent adjustment in the Purchase Price for such Title Defect as may
result under the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_, or as may otherwise be
agreed to by the parties.

 



34

    

(e) With respect to each Well and DSU set forth on _Exhibit B-1_ and
_Exhibit B-2_ affected by Title Benefits reported under _Section_ __ _
4.4(b)_, the aggregate Title Benefit Amounts, but only for those individual
Title Benefits that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold and then only
in the event the aggregate of such Title Benefit Amounts exceeds the Defect
Deductible (and only to the extent of such excess), may be used to offset
the aggregate of all Title Defect Amounts, if any.

(f) _Section 4.4(d)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser
with respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.4(a)_. _Section_ __ _ 4.4(e)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of
Seller with respect to Title Benefits asserted by Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(b)_.

(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the
amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property is reduced as
a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in
accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title
Defect Property;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect results from Seller having a lesser Net Revenue
Interest in such Title Defect Property than the Net Revenue Interest
specified therefor in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_ and the Working Interest
attributable to such Title Defect Property has been proportionately reduced,
the Title Defect Amount shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the reduction in the Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest specified for such Title Defect Property in
_Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_;

 

(iv) if the Title Defect results from any matter not described in
subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount shall be
determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Asset so
affected, the portion of Sellers interest in the Asset affected by the Title
Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential present value
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller, the estimated
capital and operational costs and expenses (or reduction or
increases thereof) attributable to Sellers Working Interest, and such other
factors as are necessary to make an evaluation and determination of such
value; and

 

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 4_ , the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
the Title Defect Property.

 



35

    

(h) The Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall
be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder. For example, if a lien affects more than one
Title Defect Property or the curative work with respect to one Title Defect
results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any other
Title Defect affecting the same or another Title Defect Property, the amount
necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work
shall be allocated among the Title Defect Properties so affected (in the
ratios of the Allocated Values of such Title Defect Properties) and the amount
so allocated to a Title Defect Property shall be included only once in the
Title Defect Amount and shall be aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that a defect
with respect to any Well or DSU shall take into account any defects related
to the Leases related to such Well or DSU.

(i) No Title Defect Amount shall be allowed on account of and to
the extent that an increase in Sellers Working Interest in a Property has
the effect of proportionately increasing Sellers Net Revenue Interest in such
Property.

 

(j) The " _Title Benefit Amount_ " for any Title Benefit means, with
respect to an affected Well or DSU, the amount by which the value of the
affected Well or DSU is enhanced by virtue of (A) Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest in such Well or DSU than the Net Revenue Interest specified
therefor in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_, or (B) Seller having a lesser
Working Interest in such Well or DSU than the Working Interest specified
therefor in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_.

 

(i) If Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, that agreed
amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount.

(ii) If the Title Benefit Amount results from Seller having a greater Net
Revenue Interest (without a corresponding increase in Working Interest) in
such Well or DSU than the Net Revenue Interest specified therefor in _Exhibit
B-1_ or _Exhibit  B-2_, the Title Benefit Amount shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the Allocated Value of such Well or DSU by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the increase in the Net Revenue
Interest (for which there is no corresponding increase in the Working
Interest), and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest specified
for such Well or DSU in _Exhibit B-1_ or _Exhibit B-2_.

(iii) In determining the amount of Title Benefit Amounts, the principles
and methodology set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_ shall generally be
applied, mutatis mutandis.

 

(k) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree on (x) all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit
Amounts, and (y) the adequacy of any curative materials provided by Seller to
cure an alleged Title Defect (with any failure to agree on items (x) and (y)
becoming, collectively, the " _Disputed Title Matters_ ") prior to Closing or
the end of the 180 day cure period, as applicable. If Seller and Purchaser are
unable to agree by Closing, Seller will convey the affected Properties to
Purchaser at Closing, and the principal amount of the Purchaser Note shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Amount as set forth in the
Title Defect Notice delivered by Purchaser for such Title Defect. If Seller
and

 



36

    

 Purchaser are unable to agree by the end of the 180 day cure period, as
applicable, the Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively and finally
resolved pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Properties are located and shall not have performed professional
services for either party or any of their respective Affiliates during the
previous three (3) years, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and
Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the Cure Period or
the end of the 180 day cure period, as applicable (the " _Title Expert_ ").
The Title Experts determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business
Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and
binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Expert shall be bound by the rules set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(h)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.4(i)_
and _Section_ __ _ 4.4(j)_ and may consider such other matters as in the
opinion of the Title Expert are necessary or helpful to make a
proper determination. The Title Expert may allow the parties to make written
submissions of their positions in the manner and to the extent the Title
Expert deems appropriate, and the Title Expert may call on the parties to
submit such other materials as the Title Expert deems helpful and appropriate
to resolution of the dispute. Additionally, the Title Expert may consult with
and engage disinterested third parties to advise the arbitrator, including
without limitation petroleum engineers and other experts as necessary. In
rendering his or her award, the Title Expert shall be limited to selecting
either Sellers position or Purchasers position on each of the Disputed Title
Matters. The Title Expert, however, may not award (A) Purchaser a greater
Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Purchaser in its
applicable Title Defect Notice or (B) Seller a greater Title Benefit Amount
than the Title Benefit Amount claimed by Seller in the applicable Title
Benefit Notice. The Title Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific Disputed Title Matters submitted by either
party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with
respect to any matter. The non-prevailing party shall pay all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, the costs associated with each
party presenting its case and the costs and fee of the Title Expert). Within
ten (10) days after the Title Expert delivers written notice to Purchaser and
Seller of his award with respect to a Disputed Title Matter, the principal
amount of the Purchaser Note as of the Effective Time shall be increased by
the amount (including, if the Disputed Title Matter relates to a Title Defect,
such amount equal to the difference between (i) the Title Defect Amount as set
forth in the Title Defect Notice delivered by Purchaser for such Title Defect
and (ii) the Title Defect Amount for such Title Defect as determined by the
Title Expert), if any, so awarded by the Title Expert to Seller, and Seller
shall be entitled to any interest accruing on such amount under the Purchaser
Note from and after the Effective Time.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall
there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by
Seller for any uncured Title Defects for which the Title Defect Amount does
not exceed $25,000 (with respect to each Well on _Exhibit  B-1_) or $75,000
(with respect to each DSU on _Exhibit B-2_) (as applicable, the " _Individual
Title Defect Threshold_ "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any
adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Title
Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Title
Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title
Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title
Defects cured by Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Environmental Defect Amounts
of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental
Threshold (but excluding any Environmental

 



37

    

 Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) an amount equal to two percent (2%) of
the Total Allocated Value (the " _Defect Deductible_ "), after which point
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies shall be made or
available to Purchaser, but only to the extent that the amount by which the
aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Environmental Defect Amounts
exceeds the Defect Deductible.

 

Section 4.5 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
date of this Agreement, if Closing occurs, Purchaser shall assume all risk of
loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion
(including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any well) and the depreciation of Equipment due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets, and Purchaser shall not assert such
matters as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is
expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain (a "
_Casualty Loss_ "), subject to Purchasers right under this _Section_ __ _
4.5(b)_ and Purchasers termination right under _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_,
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and Purchaser shall
nevertheless be required to close the transactions contemplated hereby. In the
event that the amount of the costs and expenses associated with repairing or
restoring the Assets affected by such Casualty Loss exceeds Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) net to Sellers interest, Seller must elect by
written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either to (i) cause the Assets
affected by such Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored, at Sellers sole
cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the
Closing Date), or (ii) indemnify Purchaser under an indemnification agreement
mutually acceptable to the parties against any costs or expenses that
Purchaser reasonably incurs to repair or restore the Assets subject to such
Casualty Loss. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance
and other claims against third parties with respect to the applicable
Casualty Loss except to the extent the parties otherwise agree in writing;
_provided_ that, with respect to any Casualty Loss that is less than Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (net to Sellers interest), Seller shall
pay to Purchaser all insurance proceeds actually received by Seller with
respect to such Casualty Loss. Seller shall have no other liability or
responsibility to Purchaser with respect to a condemnation or Casualty Loss,
EVEN IF SUCH CASUALTY LOSS SHALL HAVE RESULTED FROM OR SHALL HAVE ARISEN OUT
OF THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, FAULT OR VIOLATION OF A LEGAL
REQUIREMENT OF SELLER.

 

Section 4.6 Limitations on Applicability. The right of Purchaser to assert
a Title Defect under this Agreement and Sellers right to assert a Title
Benefit under this Agreement shall terminate as of the Title Claim Date,
_provided_ there shall be no termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights (i)
under  _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ with respect to any bona fide Title Defect
properly reported in a Title Defect Notice or bona fide Title Benefit properly
reported in a Title Benefit Notice on or before the Title Claim Date, (ii)
arising under the special warranty of Defensible Title as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_ or (iii) arising out of a breach of the Applicable
Seller Representations.

 



38

    

Section 4.7 Government Approvals Respecting Assets.

 

(a) _Federal and State Approvals_. Purchaser shall, within thirty (30)
days after Closing and at Purchasers own expense, file for approval with the
applicable Governmental Bodies all assignment documents and other state,
federal and Indian transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of
the Assets. Purchaser further agrees, promptly after Closing, to take all
other actions reasonably required of Purchaser by federal, state or Indian
agencies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with
respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval by such federal, state
or Indian agencies, as applicable, of Sellers assignment documents requiring
federal, state or Indian approval in order for Purchaser to be recognized by
the federal, state or Indian agencies as the owner of the Assets. Purchaser
shall provide Seller with approved copies of the assignment documents and
other state, federal and Indian transfer documents, as soon as they are
available.

 

(b) _Title Pending Governmental Approvals_. Until all of the governmental
approvals provided for in  _Section_ __ _ 4.7(a)_ have been obtained, the
following shall occur with respect to the affected portion of the Assets:

 

(i) Seller shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Purchaser;

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller from, all Assumed Seller Obligations with respect to the
affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets as if Purchaser was
the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the Assets as of the
Effective Time;

 

(iii) Seller shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall be authorized to
act only upon and in accordance with Purchasers instructions, and Seller
shall have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser in
writing;

 

(iv) Seller shall not be obligated to incur any expenses in Sellers
capacity as nominee for the benefit of Purchaser under this _Section_ __ _
4.7(b)_, and Purchaser agrees to pay or reimburse Seller for any such expenses
promptly upon receiving notice thereof; and

 

(v) For purposes of _Article 12_ , Seller and Purchaser shall treat and
deal with such affected Leases and other affected portions of the Assets as
if full legal and equitable title to the same had passed from Seller to
Purchaser at Closing.

 

ARTICLE 5

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Section 5.1 Assessment. From and after the date of execution of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall afford to Purchaser and its
officers, employees, agents and

 



39

    

 authorized representatives reasonable access to the Records and shall
reasonably coordinate and assist with Purchasers efforts to obtain permission
from the third party operators of the Properties for Purchaser and
Purchasers authorized representatives to have reasonable access to the
Properties, in each case in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_. Upon
reasonable notice to Seller, and subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I
environmental property assessment of the Assets that satisfies the basic
assessment requirements set forth under the current American Society for
Testing and Material Standard Practice for Phase I environmental property
assessments (Designation E1527-13) (the " _Phase I Assessment_ " or "
_Phase I_ ", whether one or more). The Phase I Assessment and Purchasers
other diligence activities shall be conducted at the sole cost, risk and
expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_. Seller or its designee shall have the right to accompany
Purchaser and Purchasers representatives whenever they are onsite on Assets
and also to collect split test samples if any are collected. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not have access to, and shall
not be permitted to conduct any environmental due diligence (including all or
any part of the Phase I Assessments or the Phase II Assessments) with respect
to, any Assets with respect to which Seller or its Affiliates do not have the
authority to grant access for such due diligence; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Seller and its Affiliates shall reasonably coordinate and assist with
Purchaser in obtaining permission from any other Person to allow Purchaser
and Purchasers representatives such access and as long as Seller and its
Affiliates have reasonably coordinated and assisted, Seller shall have no
liability to Purchaser for failure to obtain any such other Persons
permission. In the event that Purchasers Phase I Assessment identifies in
good faith actual or potential " _Recognized Environmental Conditions_ ," as
such conditions are defined or described under the current ASTM International
Standard Practice Designation E1527-13, then Purchaser may request Sellers
consent to conduct additional Phase II environmental property
assessments, including the collection and analysis of environmental samples
(collectively, the " _Phase II Assessment_ " or " _Phase II_ ," whether one or
more). The Phase II Assessment procedures and plan concerning any
additional investigation shall be submitted to Seller in a written
environmental property assessment plan, and shall be reasonable based on the
recognized environmental concerns identified by the Phase I Assessment.
Thereafter, Seller may, in its sole discretion, approve or deny said
environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part, and Purchaser
shall not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan
unless and until such time that Seller has approved such plan in writing;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding Sellers rejection of said environmental
property assessment plan, in whole or in part, Purchaser may still deliver an
Environmental Defect Notice with respect to such Assets pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_. Any such approved environmental property assessment plan
shall be performed in accordance with this _Article 5_ and in compliance with
all Laws. Purchaser and Seller shall maintain, and shall cause
their respective officers, employees, representatives, consultants and
advisors to maintain, all information obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any
Phase I, Phase II or other due diligence activity as strictly confidential
until the Closing occurs, unless disclosure of any facts discovered through
such Phase I, Phase II or other due diligence activity is required under any
Laws. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of the final version of all
environmental reports prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser with respect to
any Phase I, Phase II or other due diligence activity conducted on the
Properties. In the event that any necessary disclosures under applicable Laws
are required with respect to matters discovered by any Phase I, Phase II or
other due diligence activity conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser,
Purchaser agrees that Seller shall be the responsible party for disclosing
such

 



40

    

 matters to the appropriate Governmental Bodies; _provided_ that, if Seller
fails to promptly make such disclosure and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
is legally obligated to make such disclosure, such Person shall have the
right to fully comply with such legal obligation.

Section 5.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Assets have been used for the exploration, development, and production of
Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other
substances or materials located in, on or under the Properties or associated
with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain
Hazardous Materials, including NORM. NORM may affix or attach itself to the
inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The
wells, materials, and equipment located on, in or under the Properties or
included in the Assets may contain Hazardous Materials, including NORM.
Hazardous Materials, including NORM, may have come in contact with
various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils or
sediment. Special procedures may be required for the Remediation of
environmental media and Hazardous Materials, including NORM, from the Assets.

 

Section 5.3 Environmental Defects.

 

(a) If, as a result of its investigation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.1_,
Purchaser determines that with respect to the Assets, there exists an
Environmental Defect, then on or prior to 60 days after the date of this
Agreement at 5:00 p.m. Central Time (the " _Environmental Claim Date_ "),
Purchaser may notify Seller in writing of such Environmental Defect (an "
_Environmental Defect Notice_ "). EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUDED SELLER OBLIGATIONS,
FOR ALL PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED
ANY ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT WHICH PURCHASER FAILS TO ASSERT AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL
DEFECT BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT NOTICE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS
_SECTION 5.3_ RECEIVED BY SELLER ON OR BEFORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM DATE. To
be effective, each such notice must set forth (i) a description of the matter
constituting the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) the Leases, Units, Wells
and associated Assets affected by the Environmental Defect, (iii) the
estimated present value of the costs and expenses (as of the Closing Date and
discounted at a rate of seven percent (7%) based on the reasonably likely date
such Remediation activities and operations are required to be conducted) of
the Lowest Cost Response to eliminate the Environmental Defect in question;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Environmental Defect Amount shall expressly
exclude (A) the costs, fees and expenses of Purchasers and/or its Affiliates
employees or attorneys, (B) costs, fees and expenses for matters that are
ordinary costs of doing business regardless of the presence of an
Environmental Defect (e.g., those costs that would ordinarily be incurred in
the day-to-day operations of the Assets or in connection with permit
renewal/amendment activities), (C) overhead costs of Purchaser or its
Affiliates, and (D) any Remediation costs, fees or expenses charged or
chargeable to any other Working Interest owner or co-tenant or joint owner of
the underlying Assets burdened by such Environmental Defect) (the "
_Environmental Defect Amount_ ") and the calculation thereof, and (iv)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of the alleged Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Amount.

 

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any
Environmental Defect before Closing or,  _provided_ that the parties shall
have agreed to the

 



41

    

 general plan of Remediation with respect to such Environmental Defect and
the time period by which such Remediation shall take place, after Closing. If
(x) Seller disagrees with any of Purchasers assertions with respect to the
existence of an Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Amount or (y)
the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted Environmental Defect is in
dispute (with any failure to agree on items (x) and (y) becoming,
collectively, the " _Disputed Environmental Matters_ "), Purchaser and Seller
will attempt to resolve the dispute prior to Closing (or after Closing if
Seller attempts to cure an asserted Environmental Defect after Closing
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_). If the dispute cannot be resolved
within ten (10) days of the first meeting of Purchaser and Seller, any party
may submit the dispute to an environmental consultant approved in writing by
Seller and Purchaser that is experienced in environmental corrective action at
oil and gas properties in the relevant jurisdiction and that shall not have
performed professional services for either party or any of their respective
Affiliates during the previous three (3) years (the " _Independent Expert_ ").
If the parties cannot agree on whether any Environmental Defect that has been
asserted actually constitutes an Environmental Defect and as a result the
parties cannot agree whether the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(e)_ have been satisfied as of Closing, then the parties
shall cause such dispute to be resolved prior to the Closing in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ in order to determine whether such
conditions have been satisfied. The Independent Expert may elect to conduct
the dispute resolution proceeding by written submissions from Purchaser and
Seller with exhibits, including interrogatories, supplemented with appearances
by Purchaser and Seller, if necessary, as the Independent Expert may deem
necessary. After the parties and Independent Expert have had the opportunity
to review all such submissions, the Independent Expert shall call for a
final, written offer of resolution from each party. The Independent Expert
shall render its decision within fifteen (15) Business Days of receiving such
offers by selecting either one or the other of the offers on each of the
Disputed Environmental Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Independent
Expert may not award Purchaser any greater Environmental Defect Amount than
the Environmental Defect Amount claimed by Purchaser in its applicable
Environmental Defect Notice. In the event the parties have failed to resolve
any Disputed Environmental Matter at Closing, Seller shall convey the Asset
affected by the Environmental Defect to Purchaser at Closing, and at Closing,
the principal amount of the Purchaser Note shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Environmental Defect Amount as set forth in the Environmental Defect
Notice delivered by Purchaser for such Environmental Defect. Thereafter, the
Independent Expert shall render his or her decision regarding the
Environmental Defect, and the principal amount of the Purchaser Note as of the
Closing Date shall be increased by the amount equal to the difference
between (i) the Environmental Defect Amount as set forth in the Environmental
Defect Notice delivered by Purchaser for such Environmental Defect, and (ii)
the Environmental Defect Amount for such Environmental Defect as determined by
the Independent Expert), if any, so awarded by the Independent Expert to
Seller, and Seller shall be entitled to any interest accruing on such amount
under the Purchaser Note from and after the Closing Date.

 

(c) The Independent Expert may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either party with respect to any matter. The decision of the Independent
Expert shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal.
The non-prevailing party shall pay all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, the costs associated with each party presenting
its case and the costs and fee of the Independent Expert). The parties shall
adjust the Purchase Price to reflect the Environmental Defect Amounts, as
agreed by the parties or as determined by the Independent Expert, for all
uncured Environmental Defects; _provided_ , that

 



42

    

 notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any
uncured Environmental Defects for which the Environmental Defect Amount does
not exceed $100,000 (the " _Individual Environmental Threshold_ "); and (ii)
in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental Defect for which the
Environmental Defect Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental Threshold
unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Environmental Defect
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title
Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B)
the Defect Deductible, after which point adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies shall be made or available to Purchaser, but only to the extent
that the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts
and Environmental Defect Amounts exceeds the Defect Deductible.

 

Section 5.4 Inspection Indemnity. PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO DEFEND,
INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, PROTECT, SAVE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO,
ANY DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY PURCHASER OR ITS AGENTS, WHETHER
BEFORE OR AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF SUCH LOSSES ARISE
OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR
THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSON, EXCEPTING ONLY LOSSES
TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM (I) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSON OR (II) ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
THAT WERE (BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT) EXISTING PRIOR TO SUCH ACTIVITIES TO THE
EXTENT THE SAME WERE NOT EXACERBATED BY PURCHASERS OR PURCHASERS AGENTS
ACTIVITIES. The indemnity obligation set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
shall survive the Closing or termination of this Agreement for a period of
one (1) year.

 



43

    

Section 5.5 Confidentiality. Purchaser acknowledges that, pursuant to its
right of access to the Records or the Assets, Purchaser and/or Purchasers
representatives may become privy to confidential and other information of
Seller or its Affiliates, and Purchaser shall ensure that such confidential
information (i) shall not be used for any purpose other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) shall be held confidential
by Purchaser and Purchasers representatives in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. Purchaser agrees to inform Purchasers
representatives of the confidential nature of such confidential information
and to be responsible for any breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ by any of
Purchasers representatives. If Closing should occur, the foregoing
confidentiality restriction on Purchaser, including the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall terminate as of the Closing Date (except as to (a) such
portion of the Assets that are not conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information
related to Seller or its Affiliates or to assets other than the Assets).

ARTICLE 6

enter into this Agreement, qualified as, and now is an "accredited investor"
as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.
Without limiting the force and effect of the representations and warranties
of any party to a Transaction Document, Seller (i) has such knowledge, skills
and experience in business, financial and investment matters that it is

Note has been registered under the Securities Act or any state Securities Laws
by reason of specific exemptions under the provisions thereof that depend in
part upon the investment intent of Seller and of the other representations
made by Seller in this Agreement. Seller understands that Purchaser is relying
upon the representations and covenants in this Agreement (and any
supplemental information) for the purposes of determining whether this
transaction meets the requirements for such exemptions.

will constitute "restricted securities" under applicable federal Securities

Documents_ "). As of their respective effective dates and as of their

reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Purchaser in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Since the date of the most recent balance sheet of the Purchaser

_Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ shall be considered granted within ten (10) days of
(unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and such
shorter time is specified in Purchasers written notice) Sellers receipt of
Purchasers written notice to Seller requesting such consent unless Seller
notifies Purchaser to the contrary in writing during that period. In the event
of an emergency, Purchaser may take such action as a prudent operator
would take and shall notify Seller of such action promptly thereafter.

Section 8.6 Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements.

(a) The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are expressly subject
to all validly existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, Seller
shall initiate all procedures which are reasonably required to comply with or
obtain the waiver of all Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set
forth in _Schedule_ __ _ 6.12_ with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (but excluding the Customary Post-Closing Consents set forth
in  _Schedule_ __ _ 6.12_). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all applicable consents and to obtain waivers of applicable
Preference Rights; _provided_ , _however_ , Seller shall not be obligated to
pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or expense for the benefit of)
the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer Requirement in order to obtain
the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

 

(b) If the holder of a Preference Right elects prior to Closing to purchase
the Asset subject to a Preference Right (a " _Preference Property_ ") in
accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and Seller receives
written notice of such election prior to the Closing, such Preference Property
will be eliminated from the Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
the Allocated Value of the Preference Property.

 



58

    

(c) If any of the following occurs:

 

(i) a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to the
Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce a
Preference Right;

 

(ii) an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that provides that
transfer of such Asset without compliance with such Transfer Requirement will
result in termination (or the right of termination), or other material
impairment of any rights in relation to such Asset, or would cause such
transfer to be void or voidable, and such Transfer Requirement is not waived,
complied with or otherwise satisfied prior to the Closing Date; or

 

(iii) the holder of a Preference Right does not elect to purchase such
Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the
time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired;

 

then, unless otherwise agreed by Seller and Purchaser, the Asset or portion
thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a "
_Retained Asset_ ") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the principal amount of the Purchaser
Note shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Retained Asset pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.6(c)_. Any Retained Asset so held back at the
initial Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing (which
shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such Retained Asset), within
ten (10) days following the date on which the suit, action or other
proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (i) above is settled or a judgment is
rendered (and no longer subject to appeal) permitting transfer of the Retained
Asset to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or Seller complies with or
obtains a waiver of or notice of election not to exercise, or otherwise
satisfies, all remaining Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with
respect to such Retained Asset as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
8.6(c)_ (or if multiple Assets are Retained Assets, on a date mutually agreed
to by the parties in order to consolidate, to the extent reasonably possible,
the number of Closings). At the delayed Closing, the principal amount of the
Purchaser Note as of the Effective Time shall be increased by such amount by
which the principal amount of the Purchaser Note was reduced on account of the
holding back of such Retained Asset (as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2_ through the new Closing Date therefor) and Seller shall be entitled to
interest accruing on such amount under the Purchaser Note from and after the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , if any such Preference Rights and
Transfer Requirements with respect to any Retained Asset so held back at the
initial Closing are not obtained, complied with, waived or otherwise satisfied
as contemplated by this Section within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the initial Closing has occurred with respect to any Asset, then such Retained
Asset shall be eliminated from the Assets and shall become an Excluded Asset,
unless Purchaser agrees to proceed with a closing on such Retained Asset, in
which case Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any objection (and shall
be obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons for all Losses) with
respect to non-compliance with such Preference Rights and Transfer
Requirements with respect to such Retained Asset(s).

 



59

    

Section 8.7 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Seller shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns with respect to
Asset Taxes that are required to be filed by Seller on or before the Closing
Date and pay or cause to be paid the Asset Taxes due with respect thereto.
Purchaser shall file all Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date for any Tax period that ends
before or includes the Effective Time and pay the Asset Taxes due with respect
thereto. If requested by Purchaser, Seller will assist Purchaser with
preparation of all ad valorem and property Tax Returns required to be filed
after Closing for periods ending on or before the Closing Date (including any
extensions requested). With respect to such Tax Returns covering a Straddle
Period, the filing party shall provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other
party within fifteen (15) days prior to filing for such other partys
approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The parties agree that (i)
this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_ is intended to solely address the timing and
manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the
Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable Governmental Body, and
(ii) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_ shall be interpreted as altering
the manner in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by
the parties (except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax imposed as
a result of any breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 8.7(a)_, which shall be borne by Purchaser).

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to
Taxes related to the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or
other Proceeding and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Assets relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchaser or
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Body.

 

(c) Seller shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes
allocated to Seller pursuant to _Sections 2.4(b)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(vi)_ ,
and Purchaser shall be entitled to any and all refunds of Asset Taxes
allocated to Purchaser pursuant to _Sections 2.4(b)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(vi)_.
If a party or its Affiliate receives a refund of Asset Taxes to which the
other party is entitled pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.7(c)_, such
recipient party shall forward to the entitled party the amount of such refund
within thirty (30) days after such refund is received, net of any reasonable
out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by such recipient party in procuring
such refund.

 

Section 8.8 Further Assurances. After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, as applicable to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, transfer orders,
division orders, notices assumptions, releases and acquittances, and such
other instruments, and shall take such further actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to assure fully to Purchaser or Seller (including their successors
and assigns) as the case may be, that the transactions described in this
Agreement shall be completed and that all of the Assets

 



60

    

 intended to be conveyed under the terms of this Agreement are so conveyed,
including such Assets that are improperly described herein or inadvertently
omitted from this Agreement and/or the Conveyance (including the Exhibits
attached to each) and to assure fully that Purchaser has assumed the
liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

Section 8.9 Exclusivity.

 

(a) Until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and each of its and their respective representatives,
agents, consultants and advisors not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, facilitate, have or enter into any
discussions, negotiations or agreements or other instruments (whether or not
binding) regarding the sale of any of the Assets with any Person (other than
Purchaser and its representatives, consultants and advisors), (ii) furnish or
provide any information, diligence materials or diligence follow-up responses
for the purposes of evaluating a transaction relating to the Assets to any
Person (other than Purchaser and its representatives, consultants and
advisors) or (iii) grant new or allow continued access to any online or
physical data room or diligence materials to any Person (other than Purchaser
and its representatives, consultants and advisors). Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and each of its and their respective representatives,
consultants and advisors to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Purchaser
and its representatives, consultants and advisors) with respect to, or that
could lead to, the sale of any of the Assets. Seller represents and warrants
that it has closed access to any data rooms (whether online or otherwise) to
all Persons (other than Purchaser and its representatives, consultants and
advisors).

(b) In the event that Seller receives an offer or expression of interest
from any Person (other than Purchaser and its representatives, consultants
and advisors) regarding the sale of any of the Assets, Seller shall inform
such interested party that it has entered into exclusivity arrangements with
another party that would be violated if Seller, directly or indirectly,
engages in discussions with, or provides information to, such interested
party. (c) Seller acknowledges and agrees that the rights and remedies for
noncompliance with this  _Section_ __ _ 8.9_ shall include having such
provision specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it
being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall
cause irreparable injury to Purchaser and that money damages would not
provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser.

action that would reasonably be expected to cause or require Purchaser to make

enable Seller or its transferees to sell the Purchaser Common Stock comprising
the Stock Consideration without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (x) Rule 144 and Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time

by Seller where such Purchaser Common Stock (i) is sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) is sold or
transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (if Seller is not an Affiliate of Purchaser)
or (iii) is eligible for sale under Rule 144, Purchaser shall promptly take
any and all action necessary or reasonably requested by Seller or its
transferees in order to permit or facilitate such sale or transfer, including,
without limitation, at the sole expense of Purchaser, by (x) issuing such
directions to any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, as applicable, as
are reasonably necessary to facilitate such sale or transfer, (y) delivering
such opinions to the transfer agent, registrar or depository as are requested
by the same, and (z) taking or causing to be taken such other actions as are
reasonably necessary (in each case on a timely basis) in order to (A) cause

 or similar designation restricting transferability of the Purchaser Common
Stock comprising the Stock Consideration held by Seller or its transferees to
be removed from the certificates or book entries evidencing such Purchaser
Common Stock and (B) rescind any transfer restrictions. Seller agrees to
provide Purchaser, its counsel or the transfer agent with the evidence
reasonably requested by it to cause the removal of such legend, including, as
may be appropriate, any information Purchaser reasonably deems necessary to
determine that the legend, notation or similar designation is no longer
required under the Securities Act or applicable state laws, including a
certification that Seller is not an Affiliate of Purchaser (and a covenant to
inform Purchaser if it should thereafter become an Affiliate and to consent to
exchange any certificates or instruments representing the Purchaser Common
Stock comprising the Stock Consideration for ones bearing an appropriate
restrictive legend) and regarding the length of time such Purchaser Common
Stock has been held.

 

Section 8.12 Listing Application. At the Closing, Purchaser shall issue the
Stock Consideration in accordance with all applicable Securities Laws and the
rules and policies of the NYSE American. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall complete all such filings with the NYSE
American and otherwise take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary
for the Stock Consideration to be approved for listing on the NYSE American
from and after the time of Closing, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

Section 8.13 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Laws or any anti-takeover
provision or restriction on ownership in the governing documents of Purchaser
is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser
shall grant such approvals and take all such actions as are necessary or
advisable so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, regulation or provision in
Purchasers governing documents on such transactions. As used in this
Agreement, " _Takeover Laws_ " means any "moratorium," "control share

hereto that it has delivered with respect to any matter first existing or
occurring following the date hereof that if existing or occurring at or prior
to the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described in
the schedules. Any such supplement or amendment to the schedules pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall have the effect of modifying the representations
and warranties contained in _Article 6_ for the purposes of determining
whether a breach of the representations or warranties for purposes of _Article
12_ has occurred, but shall not be given effect for the purposes of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Closing shall occur, then all matters
disclosed pursuant to any such addition, supplement or amendment at or prior
to Closing shall be waived and Purchaser shall not be entitled to make a claim
with respect thereto pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise.

 

Section 8.15 Assumed Hedges. Purchaser and Seller shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, on or prior to the Closing, all
actions necessary to novate the Seller

 



64

    

 Hedges to Purchaser pursuant to the Novation Agreements (including, with
respect to Purchaser, entering into an ISDA Master Agreement with Assumed
Hedge Counterparty). Seller shall bear sole responsibility for any fees
associated with restructuring the Seller Hedges prior to the date of this
Agreement, as well as for any and all Hedge Transfer Fees, and no adjustment
shall be made to the Purchase Price for any such fees. Regardless of whether
all, some or no Seller Hedges are Assumed Hedges, except for the adjustments
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(n)_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.2(o)_, if applicable,
there shall be no adjustment made to the Purchase Price.

Section 8.16 Financial Information.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until such time as Purchaser
is no longer required under Regulation S-X of the Securities Act to separately
include financial statements associated with the Assets in documents filed
with the SEC by Purchaser pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
(it being understood that in no event shall such period extend beyond the
one-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement) (the " _Records Period_
"), Seller agrees to make available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and their
agents and representatives any and all books, records, information and
documents to the extent that such are attributable to the Assets and in
Sellers or its Affiliates possession or control and to which Sellers and
its Affiliates personnel have reasonable access, in each case as reasonably
required by Purchaser, its Affiliates and their agents and representatives in
order to prepare Purchaser Financial Statements in connection with Purchasers
filings, if any, that are required by the SEC, under Securities Laws
applicable to Purchaser, or financial statements meeting the requirements of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, _provided_ that such activities do
not unreasonably interfere with the affairs of Seller, Seller Parent or their
respective Affiliates and that Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses associated therewith, including, for avoidance of doubt,
any such costs and expenses associated with the storage and maintenance of
records for the foregoing purposes.

 

(b) During the Records Period, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its accountants, counsel, agents and other third parties to
cooperate with Purchaser and its representatives in connection with the
preparation by Purchaser of Purchaser Financial Statements that are required
to be included in any filing by Purchaser or its affiliates with the SEC, 
_provided_ that Purchaser shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses associated therewith. If requested, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver to the external audit firm that
audits the Purchaser Financial Statements (the " _Audit Firm_ ") such
representation letters, in form and substance customary for representation
letters provided to external audit firms by management of the company whose
financial statements are the subject of an audit, as may be reasonably
requested by the Audit Firm, with respect to the Purchaser Financial
Statements, including, as requested, representations regarding internal
accounting controls and disclosure controls.

(b) Without limiting the parties obligations set forth in _Section_ __ _

showing the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent possible, on
actual credits, charges, receipts and other items before and after the
Effective Time and taking into account all adjustments provided for in this
Agreement (the " _Final Price_ "). Seller shall, at Purchasers request,
supply reasonable documentation available to support any credit, charge,
receipt or other item (together with appropriate detail, including revenue
checks and joint interest billing statements). Seller shall afford Purchaser
and its representatives the opportunity to review such statement and the
supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers, and other underlying records or
documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate in
Purchasers review of such statement. Each party shall cooperate fully and
promptly with the other and their respective representatives in such

report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made to such
statement. Seller and Purchaser shall undertake to agree on the final
statement of the Final Price no later than two hundred fifty (250) days after

and Purchaser cannot reach agreement by the Final Settlement Date, either
party may refer the remaining matters in dispute to a nationally or regionally
recognized independent accounting firm as may be mutually accepted by
Purchaser and Seller, for review and final determination (the " _Agreed
Accounting Firm_ "). Each party shall summarize its position with regard to
the remaining matters in dispute in a written document of twenty-five (25)
pages or less and submit such summaries to the Agreed Accounting Firm,
together with any other documentation such party may desire to submit. Within
fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving the parties respective
submissions, the Agreed Accounting Firm shall render in writing a decision
choosing Sellers position or Purchasers position or a position in between
those (but in no event higher or lower than the amounts proposed in the post-
Closing statements exchanged between the parties, as described earlier in this
subsection) based on the materials described above. The Agreed Accounting
Firm may not award damages or penalties to either party. Any decision rendered
by the Agreed Accounting Firm pursuant hereto shall, without limiting
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)(v)_, be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and
Purchaser and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any court of
competent jurisdiction. The fees of the Agreed Accounting Firm shall be borne
and paid one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser
shall each bear their own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case.
Within ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the parties or the
Agreed Accounting Firm, as applicable, finally determines the disputed
matters, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the Final Price
exceeds the Closing Payment or (y) the principal amount of the Purchaser Note
shall be reduced by the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the Final
Price, as applicable.

(c) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by
electronic transfer of immediately available funds to the bank and account
specified by Seller in writing to Purchaser. All payments made or to be made
hereunder to Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

(b) by Seller or by Purchaser, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 31, 2019 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ shall not be
available (A) to Seller, if any breach of this Agreement by Seller has been
the principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on
or before the Termination Date, or (B) to Purchaser, if any breach of this
Agreement by Purchaser has been the principal cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date; or

(ii) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited or a Governmental Body
shall have issued an order, decree, or ruling or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, decree, ruling, or
other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

 

(c) by Seller, if (i) Purchaser shall have failed to fulfill in any
material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement and such failure
has not been cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof from
Seller to Purchaser; _provided_ that any cure period shall not extend beyond
July 30, 2019 (the " _Cure Deadline Date_ ") and shall not extend the
Termination Date, (ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(e)_ is not satisfied on or before the Cure
Deadline Date, (iii) if Purchaser fails to fund the Deposit in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_, or (iv) if the condition set forth in _Section_

(d) by Purchaser, if (i) Seller shall have failed to fulfill in any

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of
no further force or effect and the parties shall have no liability or
obligation hereunder (except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.4_, 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, this
_Article 11_ , and _Article 13_ , all of which shall continue in full force
and effect). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_ shall relieve any party from liability for Losses
resulting from its breach of this Agreement. If Seller terminates this
Agreement (or for purposes of pursing specific performance pursuant to clause

 



71

    

 (B) of this sentence, is entitled to terminate this Agreement) pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ ,
then Seller shall be entitled to (A) promptly receive from the Escrow Agent
the Escrow Funds for the sole account and use of Seller as liquidated damages
hereunder, or (B) pursue any and all remedies as may be available to Seller
at law or in equity, including specific performance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any damages recoverable by Seller at law or equity shall be capped at an
amount equal to $31,000,000 and in the case of a termination by Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , Seller shall only be entitled
to elect the remedy contemplated by clause (A) if such termination occurs as a
result of a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser which breach has been the
principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , if Seller elects to seek
specific performance of this Agreement against Purchaser under (B) above but
Closing fails to occur, Seller may elect to seek damages under (B) above and
terminate this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that (x)
Sellers actual damages upon the event of such a termination are difficult to
ascertain with any certainty, (y) the Escrow Funds are a fair and reasonable
estimate by the parties of such aggregate actual damages of Seller and (z)
such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty. If Purchaser terminates
this Agreement (or for purposes of pursing specific performance pursuant to
clause (A) of this sentence, is entitled to terminate this Agreement) pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 11.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)(_ _i_ _)_ ,
then Purchaser shall be entitled to (A) exercise any rights to specific
performance of this Agreement to which Purchaser may be entitled at law or in
equity or (B) terminate this Agreement and receive the entirety of the Escrow
Funds for the sole account and use of Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the case of a termination by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
11.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ , Purchaser shall only be entitled to elect the remedy
contemplated by clause (A) if such termination occurs as a result of a breach
of this Agreement by Seller which breach has been the principal cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination
Date. Except as set forth above, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated for any other reason, Purchaser shall be entitled to
promptly receive from the Escrow Agent the entirety of the Escrow Funds for
the account of Purchaser. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)(ii)_ because the condition set forth in _ Section_ __
_ 9.1(e)_ is not satisfied on or before the Cure Deadline Date and all other
conditions to Sellers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are satisfied (or waived), then Purchaser shall be entitled
to recover from Seller reasonable documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees and
other costs and expenses of Purchaser paid or payable to any third party
related to the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and
Purchasers title and environmental due diligence relating to the Assets, such
amount not to exceed an aggregate amount equal to $300,000.00. If the
Closing does not occur for any reason whatsoever, except as provided
otherwise in the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not be
entitled to recover any monetary damages; _provided_ , if (1) Seller refuses
to close when obligated to do so under the terms of this Agreement and (2)
Purchaser elects the remedy of specific performance but such remedy is not
awarded by courts of competent jurisdiction, then the Escrow Funds shall be
released from the Escrow Account to Purchaser (or promptly paid by Seller to
Purchaser if previously released to Seller) and Purchaser shall be entitled to
recover such direct, actual monetary damages as are available at law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers recovery for such damages shall be
limited to an amount equal to $31,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Article 11_ , in the event that a party seeks and prevails
in a claim for specific performance in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _
11.2_, it shall also be entitled to recover its attorneys fees incurred in
bringing its claim for specific performance and

 



72

    

 enforcing a judgment in connection therewith. The parties hereto agree that
specific performance is a remedy expressly negotiated by the parties and
Seller and Purchaser agree to support the application of, and not challenge,
the enforceability of specific performance as a remedy as further described in
this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ and that neither party shall be required to post a
bond in order to seek specific performance. Except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_ (including Purchasers specific performance remedies
contemplated hereby), once this Agreement is terminated, neither Party shall
have the right of specific performance with respect to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Seller and its Affiliates
shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the Assets and
to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Assets to any
Person without any restriction under this Agreement.

month and (y) true-up such aggregate net amount between the parties as
follows: (A) if such netting and true-up results in a net amount payable by
Purchaser to Seller, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller such amount, and (B)
if such netting and true-up results in a net amount payable by Seller to
Purchaser, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser such amount.

 

Section 12.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
subject to  _Section_ __ _ 12.3(viii)_ and _Section_ __ _ 12.3(ix)_, any

_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in such audit) and Purchaser is entitled to resolve all joint
interest audits and other audits of Property Costs covering periods for which
Purchaser is in whole or in part responsible as to the applicable Assets;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall not agree to any adjustments to previously
assessed costs for which Seller is liable or adjustments to which Seller would
be entitled without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall provide Seller with a
copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit agreements received by
Purchaser and relating to periods for which Seller is partially responsible.

 

Section 12.3 Assumed Seller Obligations. Subject to the indemnification by
Seller under  _Section_ __ _ 12.5_, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume and hereby agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and discharge (or cause to
be fulfilled, performed, paid or discharged) all of the obligations and
liabilities of (a) Seller, known or unknown, attributable to or resulting

of whether such obligations or liabilities arose prior to, on or after the
Effective Time, and (b) Seller Parent and Seller, known or unknown,

extent attributable to periods on or after the Closing Date (all of said
obligations and liabilities described in subparts (a) and (b) above, subject
to the exclusions below, herein being referred to as the " _Assumed Seller
Obligations_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Assumed Seller Obligations

Affiliates) and attributable to Sellers ownership of the Assets prior to the
Effective Time;

 



74

    

(iv) Seller Taxes;

 

(v) any penalties or fines imposed by any Governmental Body and related to
Sellers ownership of the Assets to the extent relating to any pre-Closing

Effective Time, (3) Sellers Affiliates (other than Seller Parent with respect
to any Assumed Hedges), and (4) Sellers lenders (other than the Assumed
Hedge Counterparties to the extent attributable to any Assumed Hedges);

_provided_ that, (x) from and after the date that is eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date, all Losses, liabilities and obligations arising
out of clauses (i) and (ii) shall no longer be Excluded Seller Obligations and
shall become Assumed Seller Obligations, and (y) from and after the date that
is twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date, all Losses, liabilities
and obligations arising out of clauses (iii), (v) and (vi) shall no longer be

Section 12.4 Survival and Limitations; Exclusive Remedy.

 

(a) The representations and warranties contained in _Articles 6_ and _7_
(other than the Fundamental Representations and the representations and
warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.7_) shall terminate twelve (12)
months after Closing. The representations and warranties contained in
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Section_
__ _ 6.5_, _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _
7.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.12_
(collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ ") and the representations
and warranties contained in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. Upon the
termination of a representation or warranty in accordance with the foregoing,
such representation or warranty shall have no further force or effect for any
purpose under this Agreement. The covenants and agreements of Seller and
Purchaser to be performed on or prior to Closing shall each survive the
Closing and terminate on the date twelve (12) months after the Closing Date.
The covenants of Seller under _Section_ __ _ 12.5(a)(iii)_ with respect to
the Excluded Seller Obligations described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v),
(vi), (viii) and (ix) of the "Excluded Seller Obligations" definition shall
survive the Closing for the period of the respective survival of the
applicable Excluded Seller Obligations described in _Section_ __ _ 12.3_. The
covenants and agreements of Seller and Purchaser to

 



75

    

 be performed after Closing (excluding the covenant under _Section_ __ _
12.5(a)(iii)_ with respect to the Excluded Seller Obligations described in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi), (viii) and (ix) of the "Excluded Seller
Obligations" definition) shall survive the Closing Date and delivery and
recordation of the Conveyances hereunder until such covenants and agreements
have been fully performed, and if any such covenants or agreements shall be
breached, until the applicable statute of limitation period in respect of such
breach has elapsed.

 

(b) No party hereto shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to
this _Article 12_ or otherwise in respect of any representation, warranty,
covenant (other than the exclusivity covenants set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.9_) or agreement unless it shall have received from the party seeking
indemnification a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of the existence of
the claim for or in respect of which indemnification in respect of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement is being sought on or before
the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _
12.4(a)_. If an Indemnified Party delivers a Claim Notice to an Indemnifying
Party before the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 12.4(a)_, then the applicable representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the
resolution of the matter covered by such Claim Notice. A Claim Notice shall
set forth with reasonable specificity (1) the basis for such claim under this
Agreement, and the facts that otherwise form the basis of such claim and (2)
to the extent reasonably estimable, an estimate of the amount of such claim
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim)
and an explanation of the calculation of such estimate.

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under
_Section_ __ _ 12.5(a)(_ _i_ _)_ (other than liabilities with respect to (x)
breaches of any Fundamental Representations, (y) the breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, or (z) a
failure of the certificate delivered at Closing by Seller (to the extent
related to the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_) to be true and correct) (i)
unless the amount of the liability for an individual claim or series of claims
arising out of the same or similar set of facts, for which a Claim Notice is
delivered by Purchaser exceeds $100,000 (" _Individual Indemnity Threshold_
"), and (ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the liabilities for all
claims for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds one and one-
half percent (1.5%) of the Total Allocated Value (the " _Aggregate Indemnity
Deductible_ ") and then to the extent such liabilities exceed the Aggregate
Indemnity Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, claims for which Claim
Notices are delivered by Purchaser which do not meet the Individual Indemnity
Threshold shall not be included in reaching the Aggregate Indemnity
Deductible.

 

(d) Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller shall
not be required to indemnify Purchaser, or otherwise be liable for breaching
any representations, warranties, or covenants under this Agreement, for
aggregate damages in excess of (i) with respect to the Fundamental
Representations, the representations set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ and
indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 12.5(a)(ii)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 12.5(a)(iii)_, one hundred percent (100%) of the Total
Allocated Value, and (ii) with respect to all other representations and
warranties contained in _Article 6_ and not included within clause (i),
fifteen percent (15%) of the Total Allocated Value. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or restrict the
right of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons to recover any amounts in
connection with any claim or action based upon fraud.

 



76

    

(e) Except (x) that each party shall be entitled to specific performance
with respect to any covenants of the other party to be performed following
Closing under this Agreement and to the extent not performed by the other
party in accordance with their specific terms, (y) with respect to rights of
Seller as an owner of the Purchaser Common Stock following Closing, and (z)
with respect to rights of Seller under the Purchaser Note, upon Closing, the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to the Assets
shall be pursuant to the express provisions of this Agreement and any
agreement delivered between the parties pursuant to this Agreement. Without
limitation of the remedies described above in this _Section_ __ _ 12.4(e)_,
if the Closing occurs, the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto
for any and all (i) claims relating to any representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements that are contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered at Closing, (ii) other claims pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement and (iii) other claims relating to the Assets
and the purchase and sale thereof, shall be any right to indemnification from
such claims that is expressly provided in this Agreement and any other
agreement delivered between the parties pursuant to this Agreement, and
through the special warranty of Defensible Title in the Conveyance, and if no
such right of indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims are
hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted by law. Except for the remedies
described above in this _Section_ __ _ 12.4(e)_, each of Purchaser and
Seller, as applicable, waives, releases, remises and forever discharges, and
shall cause each of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified
Persons, as applicable, to waive, release, remise and forever discharge, each
of the Seller Indemnified Persons or the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from any and all damages, suits, legal or administrative
proceedings, claims, demands, Losses, costs, obligations, liabilities,
interest, charges or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known
or unknown, which any of the Purchaser Indemnified Persons or
Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable, might now or subsequently may
have, based on, relating to or arising out of any of the claims described in
clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this _Section_ __ _ 12.4(e)_, INCLUDING RIGHTS
TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER CERCLA OR ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, BREACHES OF
STATUTORY AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, NUISANCE OR OTHER TORT ACTIONS, RIGHTS TO
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, COMMON LAW RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION, ANY RIGHTS UNDER
INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED OR UNDERWRITTEN BY ANY OF THE PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS OR SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, AS APPLICABLE, AND ANY RIGHTS UNDER
AGREEMENTS AMONG ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS OR PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS, AS APPLICABLE, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE
(WHETHER GROSS, SOLE, JOINT, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, COMPARATIVE, OR CONCURRENT),
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON, INVITEES OR
THIRD PARTIES.

 

(f) For federal income tax purposes, the parties agree to treat (and shall
cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment
under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by applicable Laws.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect
to the payment, indemnification, defense and hold harmless obligations under
this _Article 12_ only, for the purposes of calculating the amount of Losses
incurred arising out of or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty (including any bringdown of such representation or
warranty in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by Seller or

 



77

    

 Buyer (but not for the purposes of determining whether any representation or
warranty has been breached), the references to any qualifiers as to
materiality, material adverse effect or other similar qualifiers set forth in
such representation or warranty (including any bringdown of such
representation or warranty in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be disregarded.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
any amounts due by Seller to any Person under this _Article 12_ or for any
breach of or under any other Transaction Document shall be, _first_ ,
satisfied by reducing the aggregate principal amount payable by Purchaser
under the Purchaser Note by all such amounts, and, _second_ , after the
aggregate principal amount payable by Purchaser under the Purchaser Note has
been reduced to zero ($0) Dollars, in cash by electronic transfer of
immediately available funds to such bank and account as may be specified by
Purchaser in writing. The payment obligations by Seller under this _Section_
__ _ 12.4(g)_ shall only arise to the extent such amounts have been
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment or a written agreement of
the parties hereto executed after the delivery of any applicable Claim Notice.
No Purchaser Indemnified Person shall claim, assert or have any right to set-
off, offset, withholding or any other excuse or refusal to pay any amounts
due and payable under the Purchaser Note unless and until such amounts payable
under this _Article 12_ have been finally determined.

 

Section 12.5 Indemnification by Seller.

 

(a) Subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this _Article 12_
, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
members, agents, consultants, advisors and other representatives (including
legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors) and Affiliates and the
permitted successors and assigns of this Agreement of Purchaser (collectively,
the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Losses
asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon, or incurred or suffered by
any Purchaser Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from, arising out of
or relating to:

 

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Seller in
connection with this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
furnished by or on behalf of Seller in connection with this Agreement; and

 

(iii) the Excluded Seller Obligations.

 

Section 12.6 Indemnification by Purchaser. Excepting matters to the extent
for which Purchaser would be entitled to indemnification under _Section_ __ _
12.5_, from and after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article 12_ , Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, stockholders,
advisors and other representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and
financial advisors), and Sellers permitted successors and assigns of this
Agreement and Affiliates (collectively, the

 



78

    

 " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Losses
asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon, or incurred or suffered by any
Seller Indemnified Person, directly or indirectly, to the extent resulting
from, arising out of, or relating to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to
Seller in connection with this Agreement;

 

(b) any breach or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any certificate
furnished by or on behalf of Purchaser to Seller in connection with this
Agreement;

 

(c) the ownership, use or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time;

 

(d) the Assumed Seller Obligations; and

 

(e) Environmental Laws, Environmental Defects, Environmental Liabilities,
the release of materials into the environment or protection of human health,
safety, natural resources or the environment, or any other environmental
condition of the Assets, whether arising prior to, on or after the Effective
Time.

 

Section 12.7 Indemnification Proceedings.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which Seller or Purchaser
(such Person, an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable to a Purchaser
Indemnified Person under _Section_ __ _ 12.5_ or to a Seller Indemnified
Person under _Section_ __ _ 12.6_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") is
asserted against or sought to be collected from an Indemnified Party by a
third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall with
reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim
by delivery of a Claim Notice, _provided_ that the failure or delay to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under this _Article 12_ , except (and solely) to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its defense of such Third Party
Claim is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party (in this  _Section_ __ _ 12.7_, the " _Notice Period_ ")
to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires,
at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified
Party against such claim or demand; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party
is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice Period, and at the cost
and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer or other
pleading that it shall reasonably deem necessary to protect its interests or
those of the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim only if and for so long as the Indemnifying Party (i)
notifies the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that the Indemnifying
Party is assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) uses counsel of
its own choosing that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and
(iii) conducts the defense of such Third Party Claim in an active and diligent
manner. If the Indemnifying Party is entitled to, and does, assume the
defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel at its own expense and to participate in the
defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that 

 



79

    

 notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnified Partys counsel shall have
reasonably opined that there is a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees of counsel to the Indemnified
Party (who shall not be the same as the opining counsel), it being understood
and agreed, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be responsible for
paying for more than one separate firm of attorneys and one local counsel to
represent all of the Indemnified Parties subject to such Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects (and is entitled) to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, (i) no compromise or settlement thereof or
consent to any admission or the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the
Indemnified Partys written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless the sole relief provided is monetary
damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (and no injunctive or
other equitable relief is imposed upon the Indemnified Party) and there is an
unconditional provision whereby each plaintiff or claimant in such Third Party
Claim releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto
and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to
any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its written consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
(or fails to give notice to the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period or
otherwise is not entitled to assume such defense), the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel of
its own choice, at the expense and for the account of the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement,
compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on
the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense
in the defense of), and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control over, the defense or settlement, compromise, admission, or
acknowledgment of any Third Party Claim (i) at the reasonable expense of the
Indemnifying Party, as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the
defense during the Notice Period after the Indemnified Party gives a Claim
Notice with respect thereto to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Article 12_ or (ii) at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, to
the extent the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction, or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful, could
materially adversely affect the business, condition (financial or other),
capitalization, assets, liabilities, results of operations or prospects of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall make no settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on the part of
the Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

(e) In any case in which an Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
hereunder and no Third Party Claim is involved, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within a reasonably prompt
period of time after an officer of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
has obtained knowledge of the Loss giving rise to 

 



80

    

 indemnification hereunder. The failure or delay to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under this _Article 12_ except to the extent such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to
effectively mitigate the resulting Losses or otherwise prejudices the
Indemnifying Party.

set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2(a)_ in respect of the Second Scheduled Payment
Date).

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Prepayment Price, interest
will cease to accrue on this Note or portions thereof called for prepayment
on the applicable Prepayment Date. For purposes herein, any Prepayment Price
payable under this _Section_ __ _ 2(c)(ii)_ in excess of the principal amount
and accrued and unpaid interest prepaid shall be referred to herein as the "
_Prepayment Premium_ ".

 

(iii) Any prepayment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ shall be made
pursuant to the provisions of _Sections_ __ _ 2(d)_ through _2(g)_ hereof.

(iv) Any prepayment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ may, at the
Issuers discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including
the completion of any related equity offering or any other corporate
transaction or event.

(d) _Prepayment Notice_. At least three (3) Business Days but not more
than 60 days before a Prepayment Date, the Issuer will provide a Prepayment
Notice to each Holder whose Note is to be prepaid, in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 12(b)_.

 

The Prepayment Notice shall identify the Note and shall state:

 

(i) the Prepayment Date;

 

(ii) the Applicable Premium or the Prepayment Price, as applicable and if
any (in each case, if then determined and otherwise the method of
determination);

(iii) if the Note is being prepaid in part, the portion of the principal
amount to be prepaid;

(iv) the paragraph and or section of this Note pursuant to which the Note
called for prepayment is being prepaid; and

(v) if such prepayment is subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, the related notice shall describe each such condition,
and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers discretion, the
Prepayment Date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied or waived ( _provided_ that in no event shall such
Prepayment Date be delayed to a date later than sixty (60) days after the date
on which such Prepayment Notice was sent), or such prepayment may not occur
and such Prepayment Notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the date of prepayment,
or by the Prepayment Date as so delayed.

 

(e) _Effect of Prepayment Notice_. Once a Prepayment Notice is sent in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2(d)_, the Note called for prepayment shall
become irrevocably due and payable (subject to the provisions of _Section_ __
_ 2(d)_ hereof) on the Prepayment Date at the Prepayment Price.

(f) _Time of Payment_. If any payment on this Note becomes due on a
Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are

made on the next Business Day, as defined in _Section_ __ _ 13_ hereof, and
no additional interest will accrue solely as a result of such delay in
payment.

(g) _Application of Payments_. Payments under this Note shall be applied
(i) _ first_, to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest hereunder until
all such interest is paid, (ii) _ second_, to the payment of the Applicable
Premium (if any), the Prepayment Premium (if any) or the Change of Control
Prepayment Price above the principal amount being repaid (if any) and (iii) _
third_, to the repayment of the unpaid principal amount of this Note in the
direct order of maturity.

 

(h) _Prepayment upon a Change of Control_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein (including, without limitation _Section_ __ _
2(c)_ above),

(i) At any time prior to [January 1], 2021, the Issuer may, on any one or
more occasions, in connection with a Change of Control, prepay all or any
portion of the unpaid principal amount of this Note to each Holder, on or

Date.

(ii) On or after [January 1], 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more
occasions, in connection with a Change of Control, prepay all or any part of

provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2(d)_ hereof, at the lesser of (a) the
Prepayment Price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) of 102.500%;
and (b) the applicable Prepayment Price (corresponding to the Prepayment Date)
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2(c)(ii)_; in each case _plus_ accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the portion of the principal so prepaid, to, but
excluding, the applicable Prepayment Date, subject to the rights of Holders on
the Prepayment Date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that
is prior to the applicable Prepayment Date. Unless the Issuer defaults in the
payment of the Prepayment Price, interest will cease to accrue on this Note or
portions thereof called for prepayment on the applicable Prepayment Date.

 



5

    

(iii) If the Issuer wishes to exercise its right to prepay this Note in
accordance with _Sections 2(h)(i)_ or _2(h)(ii)_ above, the Issuer must
deliver irrevocable notice of its intent to exercise such right within seven
(7) days following the date of the consummation of such Change of Control.

(i) _Applicable Premium Upon Acceleration_. Upon any acceleration of the
Note pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4(b)(i)_ (whether automatic or optional
acceleration) following an Event of Default or otherwise, the Issuer shall
make an additional payment to the Holders in an aggregate amount equal to the
Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium, as applicable, calculated as if the
Issuer had made an optional prepayment of the entire unpaid principal amount
of this Note as of the date of such acceleration; _provided_ that any Interest
Payments made in respect of the Note for any portion of the period from the
date of acceleration through the date of such repayment shall be excluded in
the calculation of the Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium, as
applicable.

 

(j) _Mandatory Reduction and Mandatory Increase in Principal Amount_. The

unpaid interest thereon shall be automatically reduced and set-off in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 3.2, 4.4(d)(iii), 4.4(k), 5.3(b),

Holders or the Issuer [and, on the next scheduled Interest Payment Date, any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon (assuming for such purpose that such
increased principal amount had been outstanding since [July 1, 2019]) shall be
paid].

 

(k) _Limit on Increase in Principal Amount_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Note or the Purchase Agreement, in no event shall the

any Lien on any property of the Issuer.

 

(d) _No Material Adverse Effect_. Except as expressly disclosed in the SEC
Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of the Purchase Agreement (to
the extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure is readily apparent from
the content of such SEC Documents and excluding any information contained in
any part of any such report, schedule, form, statement or other document in
any section entitled "Risk Factors" or set forth in any "Forward Looking
Statements" disclaimer), since December 31, 2018, there has not been any Event

Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (i) Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Issuer
has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (ii) to the extent that the
failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material

income Tax purpose.

(h) _Disclosure; No Material Misstatements_. None of the
reports, financial statements, certificates or other written information
furnished by or on behalf of the Issuer of its Subsidiaries to any Holder
pursuant to this Note or any other document or instrument delivered by the
Issuer to any Holder hereunder or under such other document or instrument (as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished or otherwise made

light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
misleading on the date when furnished; provided that with respect to financial
estimates, projected or forecasted financial information and other forward-
looking information, the Issuer represents and warrants only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time of preparation; it being understood that (a) such
projections and forecasts, as to future events, are not to be viewed as
facts, that actual results during the period(s) covered by any such
projections or forecasts may differ significantly from the projected or
forecasted results and that such differences may be material and that such
projections and forecasts are not a guarantee of financial performance (it
being acknowledged and agreed by the Holders that certain information
furnished by the Issuer for purposes of this representation and warranty
may contain material non-public information which shall be expressly subject
to the confidentiality provision set forth in _Section_ __ _ 25_ in all
respects), and (b) no representation is made with respect to information of a
general economic or general industry nature.

(i) _Insurance_. Each of the Issuer and each of its Subsidiaries has (i)
all insurance policies sufficient for the compliance by it with all material
Governmental Requirements and all material agreements and (ii) insurance

similarly situated and engaged in the same or a similar business for the
assets and operations of the Issuer.

 

(j) _Properties; Title_.

 

(i) Each of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries has good and defensible title
to its Oil and Gas Properties it purports to own as of the date hereof.

(ii) All leases and agreements necessary for the conduct of the business
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting, in full force and
effect, except to the extent any failure to be valid and subsisting and in
full force and effect could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and there exists no default or event or circumstance which
with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would give rise to a
default under any such lease or agreement, which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



8

    

(iii) The rights and properties presently owned, leased or licensed by the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries including, without limitation, all easements and
rights of way, include all rights and properties reasonably necessary to
permit the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to conduct their business, except to
the extent any failure to satisfy the foregoing could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(iv) All of the properties of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Oil and Gas Properties, which are addressed in _Section_ __ _ 3(k)_
below) which are reasonably necessary for the operation of their businesses
are in good working condition and are maintained in accordance with prudent
business standards, except to the extent any failure to satisfy the foregoing
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(v) Each of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use,
all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for
any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Issuer and
its Subsidiaries either own or have valid licenses or other rights to use all
databases, geological data, geophysical data, engineering data, seismic data,
maps, interpretations and other technical information used in their businesses
as presently conducted, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements
governing the use of the same, which limitations are customary for
companies engaged in the business of the exploration and production of
Hydrocarbons, with such exceptions as could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(k) _Maintenance of Properties_. Except for such acts or failures to act
as could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the
Oil and Gas Properties (and properties unitized therewith) of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries have been maintained, operated and developed in a good and
workmanlike manner and in conformity with all Governmental Requirements and
in conformity with the provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts
comprising a part of the Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and
agreements forming a part of the Oil and Gas Properties of the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries. Specifically in connection with the foregoing, except as
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) no Oil
and Gas Property of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to having
allowable production reduced below the full and regular allowable production
(including the maximum permissible tolerance) because of any overproduction
(whether or not the same was permissible at the time) and (b) none of the
wells comprising a part of the Oil and Gas Properties (or properties unitized
therewith) of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries is deviated from the
vertical more than the maximum permitted by Governmental Requirements, and
such wells are, in fact, bottomed under and are producing from, and the well
bores are wholly within, such Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells
located on properties unitized therewith, such unitized properties). All
pipelines, wells, gas processing plants, platforms and other
material improvements, fixtures and equipment owned in whole or in part by
the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that are necessary to conduct normal
operations are being maintained in a state adequate to conduct normal
operations, and with respect to such of the foregoing which are

 



9

    

 operated by the Issuer, in a manner consistent with the Issuers or such
Subsidiarys past practices (other than those the failure of which to maintain
in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 3(k)_ could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect).

 

(l) _Gas Imbalances; Prepayments_. On a net basis there are no gas
imbalances, take or pay or other prepayments which would require the Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver, in the aggregate, two percent (2%) or
more of the monthly production from Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries at some future time
without then or thereafter receiving full payment therefor.

(m) _Marketing of Production_. No material agreements exist which are not
cancelable on sixty (60) days notice or less without penalty or detriment for
the sale of production from the Issuers or any of its Subsidiaries
Hydrocarbons (including, without limitation, calls on or other rights to
purchase, production, whether or not the same are currently being exercised)
that (a) pertain to the sale of production at a fixed price and (b) have a
maturity or expiry date of more than six (6) months.

(n) _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Note, (i) the Issuer is Solvent and (ii) the Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are Solvent.

 

4. _Defaults and Remedies_. 

 

(a) _Events of Default_. An " _Event of Default_ " shall occur under this
Note if:

 

(i) the Issuer shall fail to make any payment of unpaid principal or
accrued but unpaid interest under this Note when and as the same shall become
due and payable, whether upon the occurrence of the Scheduled Payment Date or
otherwise, and such failure to pay (other than in respect of principal) is not
cured within three (3) Business Days after the occurrence thereof (a "
_Payment Default_ "); or

(ii) any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
3_ of this Note shall be untrue or incorrect in any material respect as of the
time made; or

 

(iii) the Issuer shall fail to observe or perform the covenants contained
in  _Section_ __ _ 8_ or _Section_ __ _ 14_ of this Note and, in the case
of _Section_ __ _ 8_, such failure shall continue unremedied for a period of
fifteen (15) days after an executive officer of the Issuer becomes aware of
such failure;

(iv) an Insolvency Event shall occur in respect of the Issuer; or

(v) any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
Debt becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables or permits
(with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) the holder
or holders of any Material Debt or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf
to cause any Material Debt to become due, or to require the Redemption
thereof or any offer to Redeem to be made in respect thereof, prior to its
scheduled maturity or require the Issuer or any

 



10

    

 Subsidiary to make an offer in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, any such event or condition described in this _Section_ __ _ 4(a)(v)_
shall constitute an Event of Default under this Note if and only if fifteen
(15) days have elapsed since the date an executive officer of the Issuer has
become aware thereof and either (x) such event or condition has not been
waived by the requisite holders of the applicable Material Debt or cured or
(y) the applicable Material Debt has not been repaid, refinanced or replaced,
in each case, during such fifteen (15) day period.

 

(b) _Remedies_. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default:

 

(i) each Holder may declare all or any portion of its Holder Percentage of
the unpaid Obligations under this Note to be immediately due and payable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if an Event of Default specified in _Section_ __
_ 4(a)(iv)_ above occurs, the entire unpaid principal, accrued but unpaid
interest and Obligations owing under this Note shall forthwith become and be
immediately due and payable without any notice, declaration or other act on
the part of any Holder; and

 

(ii) each Holder shall be entitled to exercise any other rights which such
Holder may have pursuant to Applicable Law.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that if, prior to [July 1], 2022, the amounts outstanding under this Note are
accelerated or otherwise become due, in each case, in respect of any Event of
Default (including, but not limited to, upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or
Insolvency Event (including the acceleration of claims by operation of law)
(a " _Yield Maintenance Event_ ")), the Applicable Premium or Prepayment
Premium, respectively that would have applied if, at the time of such
acceleration, the Issuer had paid, refinanced, substituted or replaced any or
all of the Note as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2(c)_ will also be due and
payable as though a Yield Maintenance Event had occurred ( _provided_ that any
Interest Payments made in respect of the Note for any portion of the period
from the date of acceleration through the date of such repayment shall be
excluded in the calculation of the Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium,
as applicable) and the Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium, as
applicable, shall constitute part of the Obligations, in view of the
impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual damages and by
mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of the Holders
lost profits as a result thereof. Any Applicable Premium or Prepayment
Premium, as applicable, payable above shall be presumed to be the liquidated
damages sustained by the Holders as the result of payment or acceleration, as
applicable, prior to [July 1], 2022 and the Issuer agrees that the Applicable
Premium and Prepayment Premium are reasonable under the circumstances
currently existing.

THE ISSUER EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE
PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY
PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE FOREGOING APPLICABLE PREMIUM OR PREPAYMENT
PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACCELERATION.

 

The Issuer expressly agrees (to the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so)
that: (1) the Applicable Premium and Prepayment Premium are reasonable
and are the product of an arms

 



11

    

 length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented
by counsel; (2) the Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium, as applicable,
shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the time
payment is made; (3) there has been a course of conduct between the Holders
and the Issuer giving specific consideration in this transaction for such
agreement to pay the Applicable Premium or Prepayment Premium, as applicable;
and (4) the Issuer shall be estopped hereafter from claiming differently than
as agreed to in this paragraph.

The Issuer expressly acknowledges that its agreement to pay the Applicable
Premium or Prepayment Premium, as applicable, to the Holders as herein
described is a material inducement to the Holders to purchase this Note.

not reflected in the reserve report due to exploration, development or
exploitation, production or other activities that would, in accordance with
standard industry practice, cause such revisions; and

15. _Waiver of Presentment, Demand and Dishonor_. The Issuer hereby waives presentment for payment, protest, demand, notice of protest, notice of nonpayment and diligence with respect to this Note, and waives and renounces all rights to the benefits of any statute of limitations or any moratorium, appraisement, exemption, or homestead now provided or that hereafter may be provided by any federal or applicable state statute, including but not limited to exemptions provided by or allowed under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, both as to itself and as to all of its property, whether real or personal, against the enforcement and collection of the Obligations hereunder and any and all extensions, renewals, and modifications hereof. 

 

16. _Governing Law; Venue_. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Note shall be governed by, and construed in 

 



32

    

 accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State

the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. Each of the
Issuer and each Holder irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the state of
New York, for any matter arising out of or relating to this Note, except that
in actions seeking to enforce any order or any judgment of such federal or

shall be nonexclusive.

17. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the Issuer and each Holder, by accepting this Note, agrees that it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to jury trial of any claim, demand, action, or cause of action (i) arising under this Note or (ii) in any way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings in respect of this Note, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise.

19. _No Waiver_. The rights and remedies of the Holders expressly set forth in this Note are cumulative and in addition to, and not exclusive of, all other rights and remedies available at law, in equity or otherwise. No failure or delay on the part of the Holders in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default. No course of dealing between the Issuer and the Holders or their agents or employees shall be effective to amend, modify or discharge any provision of this Note or to constitute a waiver of any Event of Default. No notice to or demand upon Issuer in any case shall entitle Issuer to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the right of the Holders to exercise any right or remedy or take any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand. 

20. _Construction_. The parties have had substantial input into the drafting and preparation of this Note and have had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated hereby.

33

    

 respect to either party; provided, however, that if any such term or

Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided
in this  _Section_ __ _ 25_ shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
