This GUARANTY (this " _Guaranty_ "), dated as of July 19, 2006, is entered
into by and between Excelligence Learning Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and Thoma Cressey Fund VIII, L.P., a limited partnership
(" _Guarantor_ "). Capitalized terms used herein without definition have the

RECITALS

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, the
Company, ELC Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and
ELC Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof
(the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing for the Merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein;

WHEREAS, each of Parent and Merger Sub is an Affiliate of the Guarantor; and

WHEREAS, in order to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement,
the Guarantor has agreed to enter into this Guaranty;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Guarantor hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Guaranty_. The Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees to the Company the prompt and complete payment and performance of
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to the Company arising under the
Merger Agreement (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the maximum aggregate liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall not
exceed $15,000,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). The Company hereby agrees that
in no event shall the Guarantor, be required to pay to any Person under, in
respect of, or in connection with this Guaranty more than the Maximum Amount,
and that Guarantor shall not have any obligation or liability to any Person
relating to, arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty other than
as expressly set forth herein.

2\. _Terms of Guaranty_.

(a) This Guaranty is one of payment, not collection, and a separate action may
be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty,
irrespective of whether any action is brought against Parent or whether Parent
is joined in any such action or actions. Without limiting the foregoing,
Guarantor waives any right to require that any recourse be had by the Company
to (i) the CompanyÂ’s rights against any other Person, including Parent or
Merger Sub, or (ii) any other right or remedy available to the Company by
contract, Law or otherwise.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, the Company hereby
agrees that (i) the Guarantor may assert, as a defense to any payment or
performance by Guarantor under this Guaranty, any claim, set-off, deduction or
defense that Parent or Merger Sub could assert against the Company under the
terms of the Merger Agreement or that could otherwise be asserted by
Parent or Merger Sub against the Company in any action by the Company against
Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) any failure by the Company to comply with the
terms of the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, any breach by
the Company of the representations, warranties and covenants contained
therein or in any of the agreements, certificates and other documents required
to be delivered by the Company pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement
(whether such breach results from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or
otherwise), that would relieve Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations
under the Merger Agreement shall relieve the Guarantor of its obligations
under this Guaranty to the same extent.

3\. _Sole Remedy_.

(a) The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has any assets as of the date hereof, and that the Company shall not have
any right to cause any monies to be contributed to Parent by any current,
former or prospective stockholder, officer, member, director, agent,
employee, Affiliate or assignee of the Guarantor.

(b) The Company hereby agrees that no Person other than the Guarantor shall
have any obligation or liability arising out of, in connection with or
relating to this Guaranty and that neither the Company nor any other Person
shall have any remedy, recourse or right of recovery against any current,
former or prospective stockholder, member, general or limited partner,    officer, director, agent, employee, Affiliate or assignee of the Guarantor,
or against any current, former or prospective stockholder, member, general
or limited partner, officer, director, agent, employee, Affiliate or assignee
of any of the foregoing, whether through the Guarantor or otherwise, by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against the Guarantor or against any
current, former or prospective stockholder, member, general or limited
partner, officer, director, agent, employee, Affiliate or assignee of the
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, or
otherwise.

(c) Recourse by the Company against the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against the Guarantor or any of
its Affiliates (other than Parent or Merger Sub) in respect of any liabilities
or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or
the transactions contemplated thereby. The Company hereby covenants and
agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to
institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, against Guarantor or any of its Affiliates (other than Parent or
Merger Sub), except for claims by the Company against the Guarantor under this
Guaranty. Nothing set forth in this Guaranty shall affect or be construed to
affect any liability of Parent or Merger Sub to the Company or shall confer or
give, or shall be construed to confer or give, to any Person other than the
Company (including any Person acting in a representative capacity) any rights
or remedies against any Person in respect of or relating to any obligation or
liability of the Guarantor arising out of, in connection with or relating to
this Guaranty.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision hereof or otherwise, including by applicable
Law, no obligation or liability contained in, arising out of, in connection
with or relating to this Guaranty shall be enforceable by way of specific
performance.

4\. _Representations and Warranties of Guarantor_. Guarantor hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as set forth below:

(a) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty and the performance by
Guarantor of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary limited partnership action, and no other proceedings on the
part of Guarantor are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Guaranty and the performance by Guarantor of its obligations hereunder.

(b) This Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by Guarantor, and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable against
Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

(c) None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Guaranty by
Guarantor will (i) require any consent or approval that has not been obtained
under; (ii) require notice that has not been given under; or (iii) violate,
conflict with, breach, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would violate, conflict with, breach, or constitute a
default) under or result in the termination of (or the right of its limited
partners to terminate) its limited partnership agreement and/or other
governing documents.

(d) As of the date hereof, Guarantor has sufficient liquid and unencumbered
assets (or the enforceable right to obtain such assets from its limited
partners in connection with this Guaranty pursuant to the terms of its limited
partnership agreement or other governing documents) to satisfy its obligations
under this Guaranty, and will maintain at least such amount of liquid
and unencumbered assets (or the right to maintain such assets) until the
termination of this Guaranty in accordance with Section 5 hereof.

5\. _Termination_. This Guaranty shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of
(i) the Effective Time and (ii) the final, non-appealable adjudication or
settlement of any litigation, action, arbitration, proceeding, demand
or claim by the Company against Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor. In the event
that the Company or any of its Affiliates asserts in any litigation relating
to this Guaranty that the provisions of Section 1 hereof limiting the maximum
aggregate liability of the Guarantors to the Maximum Amount or the provisions
of Section 3 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part,
the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall terminate forthwith
and shall thereupon be null and void; provided, however, that the foregoing
provisions of this sentence shall not apply in respect of any litigation
involving claims against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their
Affiliates based on fraud (including fraudulent conveyance).

6\. _Continuing Guaranty_. Unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5 hereof, this Guaranty is a continuing one and shall remain in full
force and effect until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full of
the Guaranteed Obligations, and shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted transferees and assigns. 7\. _Entire Agreement_. This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior
discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and
agreements, whether written or oral, between the Guarantor or any of their
Affiliates on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Affiliates on the
other hand.

8\. _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty shall be valid
and binding unless it is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each of the Guarantors and the Company, or in the case of waiver, by the
party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. No waiver by a party
of any breach or violation of, or default under, this Guaranty shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent breach, violation or default hereunder
or to affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or
subsequent occurrence. No delay or omission by any party in exercising any
right, power or remedy under this Guaranty shall operate as a waiver thereof.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, Guarantor waives presentment to,
demand of payment from and protest to the Company, and also waives notice of
acceptance of its guarantee and notice of protest for nonpayment. To the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall
not be affected by (i) the failure of the Company to assert any claim or
demand or to exercise or enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger
Sub under the provisions of the Merger Agreement or otherwise, or (ii) any
rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any release from any of
the terms or provisions, of the Merger Agreement.

9\. _Counterparts_. This Guaranty may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Guaranty shall
become effective when duly executed by each party hereto.

10\. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally

ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS GUARANTY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT
CANNOT BE WAIVED, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS
SECTION 13.

14\. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Guaranty that is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Guaranty or affecting the validity or enforceability of any terms or
provisions of this Guaranty in any other jurisdiction so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Guaranty
may not be enforced without giving effect to the limitation of the amount
payable hereunder to the Maximum Amount provided in Section 1 hereof and to
