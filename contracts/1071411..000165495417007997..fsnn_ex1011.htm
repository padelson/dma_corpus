 The Parties hereby agree as follows:

 

 

  ARTICLE I

 

 

 The TRANSACTIONS

 

 

Section 1.1 The Merger and Related Matters

 

 

(a) The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Georgia
Business Corporation Code (the "GBCC") and the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the "Act"), BCHI will be merged with and into Merger Sub at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
BCHI will cease, and Merger Sub will continue as the surviving entity
(the "Surviving Company") and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and
will succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of BCHI in
accordance with the GBCC and the Act.

 

 

(b) Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Company, Merger Sub and BCHI
will cause to be filed with the Secretaries of State of the State of Georgia
and the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, or other appropriate
documents (collectively, the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the GBCC and the Act, and will
make all other filings or recordings required under the GBCC and the Act to
effect the Merger and the transactions provided for herein. The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
such Secretaries of State, or at such other time as BCHI and the
Company will agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

 

 

 

 

 

2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Effects. The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement,
including Article II, and in the applicable provisions of the GBCC and the
Act.

 

 

(d) Conversion of Securities.

 

 

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of BCHI, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of the BCHI
Common Stock, all of the shares of BCHI Common Stock (each, a "Share")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iii)) will
be converted automatically into the right to receive, in the aggregate, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, a number of fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Company Common Stock equal to three (3) times the Fully-
Diluted Company Share Total (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Closing,
all of the shares of Company Common Stock issuable to the shareholders of
BCHI pursuant to the Merger will, pursuant to the Subscription Agreements,
be issued to Holding, LLC.

 

 

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, all Shares (other than any Shares
to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iii)) will no longer be
outstanding, and, upon the conversion thereof, will automatically be
cancelled and will cease to exist. Except as set forth in Section
1.1(d)(iii), as a result of the Merger, each holder of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares ("Certificates") will thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the
applicable shares of Company Common Stock in consideration therefor, upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.1(a).

 

 

(iii) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of BCHI, Merger Sub or the Company, each Share held
in the treasury of BCHI or owned of record by any BCHI
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically
be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
will be made with respect thereto.

 

 

(iv) All of the limited liability company interests of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into and become limited liability company interests of the Surviving Company.

 

 

(v) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of BCHI, Merger Sub or the Company, all of the rights under each
share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall terminate and all of the shares of Company Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed cancelled, as provided in the Company Charter and the notice to the
holders of shares of Company Preferred Stock required by Section 6.15.

 

 

(e) Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub will, by virtue of the Merger, be the certificate
of formation and limited liability company agreement, respectively, of the
Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

 

 

 

 

3

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Directors. The Parties will take all necessary action such that, from and
after the Effective Time, each Subsidiary of the Company will have two (2)
directors (or, in the case of a limited liability company, two (2)
managers) who are mutually acceptable to BCHI and the Company and who
will serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 

(g) Officers. The officers of the Surviving Company from and after the
Effective Time will be determined prior to the Closing by mutual agreement of
BCHI and the Company.

Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed all federal, state, foreign and local
Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them (all such returns being
accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly and timely paid
all Taxes (whether or not such Taxes were shown as due and payable on such
Tax Returns) other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or that are being

adequately reserved against. Any liability with respect to deficiencies
asserted as a result of any audit, examination or similar proceeding of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary Tax Return by the IRS or any other taxing
authority has been paid or is covered by adequate reserves in accordance
with GAAP in the Company Financial Statements. There are no
disputes pending, or claims asserted in writing, for Taxes or
assessments upon the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, other
than disputes, claims and assessments that are not material to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries either individually or in the aggregate. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by
any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement
(other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries). Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has agreed to or granted any extension or waiver of
the limitation period applicable to any Taxes or Tax Returns. Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has distributed the stock of any
corporation, or had its stock distributed, in a transaction described in or

in all material respects properly and timely withheld or collected
and timely paid over to the appropriate taxing authority (or each
is properly holding for such timely payment) all Taxes required to
be withheld, collected and paid over by applicable Law. There are no Liens
for Taxes upon any asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than
Permitted Liens (within the meaning of clause (c) of such term). Neither the
Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or other similar material
agreement or ruling relating to Taxes nor are there any pending requests
for such rulings or similar agreements by or before a taxing
authority. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries will
be required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item
of deduction from, taxable income for any period (or any portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date, as a result of any: (i) change in method of
accounting for a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, including

(ii) installment sale or other open transaction disposition made on or prior

Company is the common parent, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has any liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of applicable Law, as a transferee or successor, as a
result of any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any other
Person. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has obtained
any consent or clearance from or entered into any settlement or arrangement
with any taxing authority that would be binding on the Surviving Company or
any of its Affiliates or result in a material Tax liability for
the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates for any Tax period
(or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries has engaged in a "reportable transaction," as
defined in Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code or Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6011-4(b), or any transaction requiring disclosure under a similar
provision of applicable Law. Within the past three (3) years, no written
claim or nexus inquiry has been made by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that
any of them is or may be subject to tax by that jurisdiction or that any of
them has a duty to collect Taxes.

a "qualified plan" under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code has either
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that such Company
Pension Plan is so qualified or has requested such a favorable determination
letter within the remedial amendment period of Section 401(b) of the Code, or
in the case of a Company Pension Plan that is maintained pursuant to the
adoption of a master, prototype, or volume submitter plan document, the
sponsor of such master or prototype or volume submitter plan document
has obtained from the National Office of the IRS an opinion or notification
letter stating that the form of the master, prototype or volume submitter
document is acceptable for the establishment of a qualified retirement plan.
Each Company Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto, that is eligible
for approval by, and/or registration for and/or qualification for special Tax
status with, the appropriate taxation, social security and/or
supervisory authorities in the relevant country, state, province, territory
or the like (each, an "Company Approval") has received such Company
Approval, or there remains a period of time in which to obtain such Company
Approval retroactive to the date of any amendment or change in Law that has
not previously received such Company Approval. The Company Benefit Plans
comply in form and in operation, and have been administered in all material
respects in compliance with their terms and with the requirements of,
as applicable, the Code, ERISA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act and all other applicable Laws, and none of the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and its Company Commonly Controlled Entities have received any
notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging such
compliance that has not been resolved.

 

 

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, there have been no non-exempt
"prohibited transactions" (as that term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) involving any of the Company Benefit Plans.
Except as set forth in Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, none

"employer security" (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(1) of ERISA) or
"employer real property" (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(2) of ERISA).

 

 

(d) (i) Neither the Company nor any other Person that, together with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any other
applicable Law (a "Company Commonly Controlled Entity") (A) has
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, or been obligated to maintain
or contribute to, or has any liability under, any Company Pension Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or Section 430 of the Code or
is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan in the relevant country, state,
province, territory or the like, and (B) has any unsatisfied liability
imposed under Title IV of ERISA, and (ii) all contributions (including all
employer contributions and employee salary reduction contributions)
or insurance premiums that are due have been paid with respect to
each Company Benefit Plan, and all contributions or insurance premiums for
any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet due have
been paid with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan or accrued, in each
case in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company, and with
applicable Law and administrative agency regulations.

 

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has communicated a
commitment (whether orally or in writing, whether as part of the collective
bargaining process or not) generally to employees, any employee
representation body or specifically to any employee regarding (i) any
future increase of benefit levels (or creation of new benefits) with respect
to the Company Benefit Plans beyond those reflected in such plans, or (ii)
the adoption or creation of any new benefit plan.

 

 

(f) None of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Commonly Controlled Entities currently contributes to or has had
any liability or potential liability with respect to (i) any "multiemployer

pension plans or multi-employer benefit plans in the relevant country, state,
province, territory or the like, during the five (5)-year period ending as of
the Closing Date.

 

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
none of the Company Welfare Plans obligates the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to provide any current employee or former employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary (or any dependent thereof) any life insurance or
medical or health benefits after his or her termination of employment
with the Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than as required
under COBRA or any similar state Law. All amounts required to be included in
the Company's most recent financial statements in respect of any Company
Welfare Plan have been included.

 

 

 

 

 

13

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) No Company Benefit Plan (excluding for this purpose any individual
employment agreement or arrangement) has a provision, and no
commitment (whether oral or in writing) has been made, that restricts
the Company or Company Subsidiaries from amending or terminating
such Company Benefit Plan with respect to the accrual of future benefits;
except that the legal obligation to bargain over mandatory subjects of
bargaining under any Law will not be considered such a restriction.

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
no amounts payable under any Company Benefit Plan will fail to be deductible
for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or will
fail to be deductible for tax purposes under any other applicable
Law. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(i) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any current
employee or former employee (or spouse, dependent or other family member of
such employee) of the Company or Company Subsidiaries to severance pay,
unemployment compensation, or any payment contingent upon a change in control
or ownership of the Company or Company Subsidiaries, or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount, of any compensation due
to any such current employee or former employee (or any spouse, dependent, or
family member of such employee). Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any obligation to provide, and no Company Benefit Plan or
other agreement provides any Person with any amount of
additional compensation or gross-up if such Person is provided with
amounts subject to excise or additional taxes, interest or
penalties incurred pursuant to Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code or due
to the failure of any payment to be deductible under Section 280G of the
Code.

 

 

(j) (i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code is and has been, during the five
years prior to the date hereof, in all material respects in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any guidance issued
with respect thereto and (ii) no Company Option is considered to be a non-
qualified deferred compensation arrangement subject to Section 409A of
the Code.

 

 

(k) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have correctly classified
Persons engaged as consultants or independent contractors for employment
purposes and have correctly administered Section 414(n) of the Code with
respect to the Company Pension Plans.

concerning employment rights and obligations. Section 3.10(l) of the
Company Disclosure Letter lists each collective bargaining agreement
to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party in respect of the
employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary on the date of this
Agreement, and any membership of the Company or a Company Subsidiary in any
employers' organization which is entitled to conclude a collective bargaining
agreement on behalf of its member companies, and any collective bargaining
agreement which, although the Company or Company Subsidiary is not a party to
it, applies due to standard reference in employment agreements or by state
decree as a generally applicable collective bargaining agreement. No
collective bargaining agreement or shop agreement is being negotiated or
renegotiated in any material respect by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, work stoppage, slow down or strike
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened which would interfere with the
respective business activities of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (and no work stoppages, slow downs, labor disputes
or strikes occurred during the last five years). As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has committed during the three years prior to the
date hereof any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the
respective businesses of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and
there is no charge or complaint against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
Governmental Entity or in relation to any labor rules and regulations or any
other competent labor authority pending or threatened in writing.

 

 

(m) Section 3.10(m) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all material (i) severance or employment agreements
with directors, officers, employees, or consultants of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, (ii) severance programs of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary with or relating to its employees, or (iii) plans, programs or
other agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with or relating to
its directors, officers, employees or consultants which contain change in
control provisions.

 

 

(n) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(n) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, the Company Benefit Plans (other than routine undisputed
claims for benefits under the Company Benefit Plans or other immaterial
claims or disputes that are being handled in the normal course of
plan administration), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
with respect to any claim (including claims for benefits under Company
Benefit Plans). To the knowledge of the Company, no facts exist which could
give rise to any actions, audits, suits or claims (other than in the ordinary
course).

a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" (within the meaning of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code) or a "supplemental unemployment benefit plan"
(within the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code).

(a) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is, and at all times
during the five (5) years prior to the date hereof, have been in compliance
in all material respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound. To the knowledge of the Company,
no investigation by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is pending, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated
to the Company an intention to conduct any such investigation with respect
to, either individually or in the aggregate, material matters or material
liabilities.

 

 

(b) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has received any
notice of any alleged violation of any Laws that remains unresolved
or outstanding, except where any such notice, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.12 Environmental Matters . Except as disclosed in Section 3.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries is, and at all times has been, in compliance in all

the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any Environmental Law. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
any other Person, has caused or taken any action that could reasonably be

the environmental conditions at, on, above, under, or about any properties or
assets currently or formerly owned, leased, operated or used by the Company
or any of their respective predecessors in interest or (ii) the past or
present use, management, handling, transport, treatment, generation, storage,

has provided to BCHI all material environmental site assessments, audits,
investigations and studies in their possession, custody or control relating
to property or assets currently or formerly owned, leased, operated or used
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has been in business other than those related to the provision of
communication services that would reasonably be expected to present

presented in the provision of communication services. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has operated or currently operates (i) any
manufacturing facilities, (ii) any facilities that are or have been

(ii) any pending proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity, including
the FCC or State PSCs to suspend, revoke or cancel such Company License, or
any judicial review of a decision by any Governmental Entity, including the
FCC or State PSCs with respect thereto. To the knowledge of the Company,
there has not been any event, condition or circumstance that would preclude
any Company License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to the extent
that such Company License is renewable by its terms).

 

 

(c) The licensee of each Company License is in compliance in all material
respects with such Company License and has fulfilled and performed all of
its material obligations with respect thereto, including all
reports, notifications and applications required by any Law, including
the Communications Act of 1934 (the "Communications Act") or the rules,

Programs, CALEA and CPNI obligations.

the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company directly or
indirectly owns all of the Equity Interests and controls all of the voting
power and decision-making authority of each licensee of the Company
Licenses. No Company License, Order or other agreement, obtained from,
issued by or concluded with any State PSC would impose restrictions on
the ability of any Company Subsidiary to make payments, dividends or other
distributions to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that limits, or would
reasonably be expected to limit, the cash funding and management alternatives
of the Company on a consolidated basis in a manner disproportionate to
restrictions applied by other State PSCs.

or acceleration by any third party of any Company Network Facility Agreement,
and (iii) as of the date hereof, no third party has repudiated, revoked,
terminated, or otherwise materially interfered with performance of or has the
right to terminate, repudiate, revoke, or otherwise materially interfere with

Facility Agreement for any upcoming renewal term have been taken or given
in the manner and within the time provided in such Company Network Facility
Agreement (or the time period provided for giving of such notice or to
undertake such action has not expired) to effectively renew the term of such
Company Network Facility Agreement for the upcoming term thereof to the
extent that such Company Network Facility Agreement is renewable by its terms
and the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary intends to renew such

the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
hold all Company Network Facility Agreements necessary to conduct
the Company's business and no event has occurred, or circumstance exists,
that, but for the passage of time or giving of notice, would preclude any

intends to renew such Company Network Facility Agreement.

(d) The unaudited consolidated financial statements of BCHI and the other
BCHI Subsidiaries (including in each case, any related notes and schedules
thereto, where applicable) set forth in Section 4.5 of the BCHI Disclosure
Letter fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of BCHI and the other BCHI Subsidiaries as of the date thereof, and
fairly present in all material respects the results of the consolidated
operations, changes in stockholders' equity, cash flows and
consolidated financial position of BCHI and the other BCHI Subsidiaries for
the respective fiscal periods or as of the date therein set forth, except
that such financial statements are subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments in amounts as permitted by GAAP. Such financial statements
(including the related notes and schedules thereto, where applicable), as of
their respective dates, complied in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and each of such statements (including the related
notes and schedules thereto, where applicable) and have been prepared, in
all material respects, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during
the periods involved, except as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The unaudited consolidated financial statements of BCHI and the
other BCHI Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 through
December 31, 2016 will not differ in any respect (other than in deminimis
respects) from the audited consolidated financial statements of BCHI and the
other BCHI Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 through
December 31, 2016.

 

 

Section 4.6 Absence of BCHI Material Adverse Effect . Since January 1, 2017
through the date of this Agreement, no event or events have occurred that
have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a BCHI Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.7 Legal Proceedings

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.7 of the BCHI Disclosure Letter,
neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to the knowledge of BCHI, threatened (in writing), legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, suits
or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature, against BCHI or
any of the BCHI Subsidiaries which would, if decided adversely to BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary, prohibit the Transactions or reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability or obligation of, or otherwise be materially
adverse to, BCHI or a BCHI Subsidiary.

 

 

(b) There is no outstanding material Order imposed upon BCHI, any of the
BCHI Subsidiaries or the assets of BCHI or any of the BCHI Subsidiaries.

Section 4.8 Taxes and Tax Returns . Each of BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries
has duly and timely filed all federal, state, foreign and local Tax Returns
required to be filed by any of them (all such returns being accurate and
complete in all material respects) and has duly and timely paid all Taxes
(whether or not such Taxes were shown as due and payable on such
Tax Returns) other than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or that are being
contested in good faith, have not been finally determined and have been
adequately reserved against. Any liability with respect to deficiencies
asserted as a result of any audit, examination or similar proceeding of BCHI
or any BCHI Subsidiary Tax Return by the IRS, the CRA, or any other taxing
authority is covered by adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP in the BCHI
Financial Statements. There are no disputes pending, or claims asserted in
writing, for Taxes or assessments upon BCHI or any of the BCHI
Subsidiaries, other than disputes, claims and assessments that are not
material to BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries either individually or in
the aggregate. Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries is a party to
or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or
arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between
or among BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries). Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI
Subsidiaries has agreed to or granted any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Taxes or Tax Returns. Neither BCHI nor
any of the BCHI Subsidiaries has distributed the stock of any corporation,
or had its stock distributed, in a transaction described in or intended to
satisfy the requirements of Section 355 of the Code within the past three (3)
years. Each of BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries has in all material respects
properly and timely withheld or collected and timely paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority (or each is properly holding for such
timely payment) all Taxes required to be withheld, collected and paid
over by applicable Law. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any asset of BCHI
or any BCHI Subsidiary other than Permitted Liens (within the meaning of
clause (c) of such term). Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or
other similar material agreement or ruling relating to Taxes nor are there
any pending requests for such rulings or similar agreements by or before a
taxing authority. Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries will be
required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item of
deduction from, taxable income for any period (or any portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date, as a result of any: (i) change in method
of accounting for a Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date, including under Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of
applicable Law; (ii) installment sale or other open transaction disposition
made on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) prepaid amount received on or
prior to the Closing Date; (iv) closing agreement described in Section 7121
of the Code or any similar provision of applicable Law executed on or prior
to the Closing Date; (v) intercompany transaction or excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502 (or any similar provision
of applicable Law); or (vi) indebtedness discharged in connection with any
election under Section 108(i) of the Code. Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI
Subsidiaries has any liability under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or
any similar provision of applicable Law, as a transferee or successor, as a
result of any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any other
Person. Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries has obtained any
consent or clearance from or entered into any settlement or arrangement
with any taxing authority that would be binding on BCHI or any of
its Affiliates or result in a material Tax liability for BCHI or any of its
Affiliates for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date. Neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI Subsidiaries has engaged in a
"reportable transaction," as defined in Section 6707A(c)(1) of the Code or
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b), or any transaction requiring
disclosure under a similar provision of applicable Law. Within the past three
(3) years, no written claim or nexus inquiry has been made by a
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary
does not file Tax Returns that any of them is or may be subject to tax by
that jurisdiction or that any of them has a duty to collect Taxes. No facts,
circumstances or events exist or have existed that have resulted in or may
result in the applications of any of sections 79 to 80,04 of the ITA to BCHI
or any BCHI Subsidiary. Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary is liable for
Taxes of any other person, and neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has
acquired property from any person in circumstances where BCHI did or
could become liable for any Taxes of such person. The value of
the consideration paid or received by BCHI and each BCHI Subsidiary for the
acquisition, sale, transfer or provision of property (including intangibles)
or the provision of services (including financial transactions) from or to a
person with whom BCHI or BCHI Subsidiary, as applicable, was not dealing at
arm's length for purposes of the ITA was equal to the estimated fair
market value of such property acquired, provided or sold or
services purchased or provided. Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary
has claimed any reserves for purposes of the ITA (or analogous provincial or
similar provisions) for the most recent taxation year ending prior to the
date hereof. Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has made any payment, or is
obligated to make any payment, and neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary is
party to any agreement under which BCHI or such BCHI Subsidiary, as
applicable, could be obligated to make any payment, that, in each case, may
not be deductible by virtue of section 67 or 78 of the ITA or any analogous
provincial or similar provision. BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries have duly
registered with the applicable Governmental Authority for Sales Tax purposes
and at all times complied with all Sales Tax obligations and requirements
imposed pursuant to applicable Law. All input tax credits and refunds claimed
by BCHI and each BCHI Subsidiary for Sales Tax purposes were calculated
in accordance with applicable Law. BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries
have complied with all registration, reporting, payment, collection
and remittance requirements in respect of Sales Taxes in accordance with
applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the BCHI Disclosure
Letter, (i) BCHI is, and has been at all times during its existence, a
validly electing S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362
of the Code, (ii) each of the BCHI Subsidiaries is, and has been during its
respective existence, an entity disregarded as separate from BCHI for tax
purposes, (iii) BCHI has no potential liability for any Tax under Section
1374 of the Code, and (iv) neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has ever been
a member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group for federal, state or
local income tax purposes.

Section 4.9 Employee Benefit Plans; Labor

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(a) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter,
none of BCHI, any BCHI Subsidiary, nor any BCHI Commonly Controlled Entity
maintains or contributes to (i) any nonqualified deferred compensation, post-
termination or retirement plans for employees, (ii) any qualified "defined
contribution plans" (as such term is defined under Section 3(34) of ERISA
(whether or not subject to ERISA)), (iii) any other defined contribution
pension plan in the relevant country, state, province, territory or the like,
(iv) any "defined benefit plans" (as such term is defined under Section
3(35) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA)), or (v) any other defined
benefit pension plan in the relevant country, state, province, territory or
the like (the plans set forth in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are
collectively referred to herein as the "BCHI Pension Plans"), (vi) any
"employee welfare benefit plans" (as such term is defined under Section 3(1)
of ERISA, or (vii) any other group insurance benefit arrangements in the
relevant country, state, province, territory or the like (whether or not
subject to ERISA)) (the "BCHI Welfare Plans"), or (viii) any compensatory or
benefit plans or programs, or equity or equity-based award plans, including
written individual contracts, employee agreements, plans, programs, or
arrangements, whether funded or unfunded, written or oral, that currently
are, or within the past six (6) fiscal years of BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary,
as appropriate, have been, maintained, contributed to or sponsored (or are or
have been required to be maintained, contributed to or sponsored) in whole or
in part, by any of BCHI, the BCHI Subsidiaries and the BCHI Commonly
Controlled Entities, for the benefit of, providing any remuneration or
benefits to, or covering any current or former employee or retiree, any
dependent, spouse or other family member or beneficiary of such employee
or retiree, or any director, independent contractor, member,
officer, consultant of any of BCHI, the BCHI Subsidiaries and the
BCHI Commonly Controlled Entities, or under (or in connection with) which
BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary or any of the BCHI Commonly Controlled Entities
may have any liability (collectively clauses (i) through (viii) are
referred to as "BCHI Benefit Plans").

 

 

(b) Each BCHI Pension Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of
a "qualified plan" under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code has either
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that such BCHI Pension
Plan is so qualified or has requested such a favorable determination letter
within the remedial amendment period of Section 401(b) of the Code, or in the
case of a BCHI Pension Plan that is maintained pursuant to the adoption of
a master, prototype, or volume submitter plan document, the sponsor of such
master or prototype or volume submitter plan document has obtained from the
National Office of the IRS an opinion or notification letter stating that the
form of the master, prototype or volume submitter document is acceptable for
the establishment of a qualified retirement plan. Each BCHI Benefit Plan,
including any amendments thereto, that is eligible for approval by,
and/or registration for and/or qualification for special Tax status
with, the appropriate taxation, social security and/or
supervisory authorities in the relevant country, state, province, territory
or the like (each, a "BCHI Approval") has received such BCHI Approval, or
there remains a period of time in which to obtain such BCHI Approval
retroactive to the date of any amendment or change in Law that has not
previously received such BCHI Approval. The BCHI Benefit Plans comply in form
and in operation, and have been administered in all material respects
in compliance with their terms and with the requirements of, as applicable,
the Code, ERISA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and all other
applicable Laws, and none of BCHI, the BCHI Subsidiaries and its BCHI
Commonly Controlled Entities have received any notice from any Governmental
Entity questioning or challenging such compliance that has not
been resolved.

 

 

(c) To the knowledge of BCHI, there have been no non-exempt
"prohibited transactions" (as that term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code) involving any of the BCHI Benefit Plans. Except
as set forth in Section 4.9(c) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter, none of the
assets of any BCHI Pension Plan or BCHI Welfare Plan trust is an "employer
security" (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(1) of ERISA) or "employer
real property" (within the meaning of Section 407(d)(2) of ERISA).

 

 

(d) (i) Neither BCHI nor any other Person that, together with BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code or any other applicable Law (a "BCHI
Commonly Controlled Entity") (A) has sponsored, maintained or contributed
to, or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, or has any liability
under, any BCHI Pension Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 or Section 430 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan
in the relevant country, state, province, territory or the like, and (B) has
any unsatisfied liability imposed under Title IV of ERISA, and (ii)
all contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) or insurance premiums that are due have been paid
with respect to each BCHI Benefit Plan, and all contributions or insurance
premiums for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are not yet
due have been paid with respect to each such BCHI Benefit Plan or accrued, in
each case in accordance with the past custom and practice of BCHI, and
with applicable Law and administrative agency regulations.

 

 

 

 

 

28

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has communicated a commitment
(whether orally or in writing, whether as part of the collective bargaining
process or not) generally to employees, any employee representation body
or specifically to any employee regarding (i) any future increase of benefit
levels (or creation of new benefits) with respect to the BCHI Benefit Plans
beyond those reflected in such plans, or (ii) the adoption or creation of any
new benefit plan.

 

 

(f) None of BCHI, the BCHI Subsidiaries and the BCHI Commonly Controlled
Entities currently contributes to or has had any liability or
potential liability with respect to (i) any "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or (ii) any multi-employer pension plans or multi-
employer benefit plans in the relevant country, state, province, territory or
the like, during the five (5)-year period ending as of the Closing Date.

 

 

(g) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(g) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter,
none of the BCHI Welfare Plans obligates BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary to
provide any current employee or former employee of BCHI or a BCHI Subsidiary
(or any dependent thereof) any life insurance or medical or health
benefits after his or her termination of employment with BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary, other than as required under COBRA or any similar
state Law. All amounts required to be included in BCHI's most recent
financial statements in respect of any BCHI Welfare Plan have been included.

 

 

(h) No BCHI Benefit Plan (excluding for this purpose any individual
employment agreement or arrangement) has a provision, and no
commitment (whether oral or in writing) has been made, that restricts BCHI
or BCHI Subsidiaries from amending or terminating such BCHI Benefit Plan
with respect to the accrual of future benefits; except that the legal
obligation to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining under any Law
will not be considered such a restriction.

 

 

(i) No amounts payable under any BCHI Benefit Plan will fail to be deductible
for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code or
will fail to be deductible for tax purposes under any other applicable Law.
Except as set forth in Section 4.9(i) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter,
consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any current employee or
former employee of BCHI or a BCHI Subsidiary (or spouse, dependent or other
family member of such employee) to severance pay, unemployment compensation,
or any payment contingent upon a change in control or ownership of BCHI
or BCHI Subsidiaries, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount, of any compensation due to any such current employee or
former employee of BCHI or a BCHI Subsidiary (or any spouse, dependent, or
family member of such employee). Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has any
obligation to provide, and no BCHI Benefit Plan or other agreement
provides any Person with any amount of additional compensation or gross-
up if such Person is provided with amounts subject to excise or additional
taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Sections 4999 or 409A of
the Code or due to the failure of any payment to be deductible under Section
280G of the Code.

 

 

(j) Each BCHI Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the
Code) subject to Section 409A of the Code is and has been, during the five
years prior to the date hereof, in all material respects in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and any guidance issued
with respect thereto.

 

 

(k) BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries have correctly classified Persons engaged
as consultants or independent contractors for employment purposes and have
correctly administered Section 414(n) of the Code with respect to the BCHI
Pension Plans.

 

 

 

 

 

 

29

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l) BCHI has complied in all material respects with all Laws concerning
employment rights and obligations. Section 4.9(l) of the BCHI Disclosure
Letter lists each collective bargaining agreement to which BCHI or a BCHI
Subsidiary is a party in respect of the employees of BCHI or a BCHI
Subsidiary on the date of this Agreement, and any membership of BCHI or a
BCHI Subsidiary in any employers' organization which is entitled to conclude
a collective bargaining agreement on behalf of its member companies, and any
collective bargaining agreement which, although BCHI or BCHI Subsidiary is
not a party to it, applies due to standard reference in employment agreements
or by state decree as a generally applicable collective bargaining agreement.
No collective bargaining agreement or shop agreement is being negotiated or
renegotiated in any material respect by BCHI or any of the BCHI Subsidiaries.
There is no labor dispute, work stoppage, slow down or strike against BCHI or
any of the BCHI Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of BCHI, threatened
which would interfere with the respective business activities of BCHI or any
of the BCHI Subsidiaries (and no work stoppages, slow downs, labor disputes
or strikes occurred during the last five years). As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of BCHI, neither BCHI nor any of the BCHI
Subsidiaries has committed during the three years prior to the date hereof
any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective
businesses of BCHI or any of the BCHI Subsidiaries, and there is no charge or
complaint against BCHI or any of the BCHI Subsidiaries by the National
Labor Relations Board or any comparable Governmental Entity or in relation
to any labor rules and regulations or any other competent labor authority
pending or threatened in writing.

 

 

(m) Section 4.9(m) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all material (i) severance or employment agreements
with directors, officers, employees, or consultants of BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary, (ii) severance programs of BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary with
or relating to its employees, or (iii) plans, programs or other agreements of
BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary with or relating to its directors, officers,
employees or consultants which contain change in control provisions.

 

 

(n) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(n) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter,
there are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, the BCHI Benefit Plans (other than routine undisputed claims
for benefits under the BCHI Benefit Plans or other immaterial claims or
disputes that are being handled in the normal course of
plan administration), and no action, legal or otherwise, has been commenced
with respect to any claim (including claims for benefits under BCHI Benefit
Plans). To the knowledge of BCHI, no facts exist which could give rise to any
actions, audits, suits or claims (other than in the ordinary course).

 

 

(o) No BCHI Benefit Plan is or at any time was funded through a "welfare
benefit fund," as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, and no benefits
under any BCHI Benefit Plan are or at any time have been provided through a
"voluntary employees' beneficiary association" (within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code) or a "supplemental unemployment benefit plan" (within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code).

 

 

Section 4.10 Compliance with Law

 

 

(a) BCHI and each of the BCHI Subsidiaries is, and at all times during the
five (5) years prior to the date hereof, have been in compliance in
all material respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to BCHI or any of
the BCHI Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of BCHI or any BCHI
Subsidiary is bound. To the knowledge of BCHI, no investigation by any
Governmental Entity with respect to BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary is pending,
nor has any Governmental Entity indicated to BCHI an intention to conduct any
such investigation with respect to, either individually or in the aggregate,
material matters or material liabilities.

 

 

(b) None of BCHI or any of the BCHI Subsidiaries has received any notice of
any alleged violation of any Laws that remains unresolved or outstanding,
except where any such notice, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a BCHI Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.11 Environmental Matters

 

 

 . BCHI and each of the BCHI Subsidiaries is, and at all times have
been, in compliance in all material respects with all Environmental
Laws. BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries hold all Permits required
under applicable Environmental Laws to permit BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries
to conduct their businesses as currently conducted. The business and
operations of BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries are in compliance with all such
Permits. No notice of violation, notification of liability, demand, request
for information, citation, summons or order has been received by BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary, no complaint has been filed, no penalty or fine has been
assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit or proceeding is pending
or, to the knowledge of BCHI, threatened by any Person involving BCHI or any
BCHI Subsidiary relating to or arising out of any Environmental Law. No
Hazardous Substances are or were located and no disposal or Releases of
Hazardous Substances have occurred at, on, above, under or from any
properties currently or, to the knowledge of BCHI at the time of the
cessation of such ownership, lease, operation or use, formerly owned,
leased, operated or used by BCHI, any BCHI Subsidiary or any predecessors in
interest that, in each case, has resulted in or would reasonably be expected
to result in any material cost, liability or obligation of BCHI or any BCHI
Subsidiary under any Environmental Law. Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary,
nor, to the knowledge of BCHI, any other Person, has caused or taken any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability
or obligation relating to (i) the environmental conditions at, on, above,
under, or about any properties or assets currently or formerly
owned, leased, operated or used by BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary or any
of their respective predecessors in interest or (ii) the past or present
use, management, handling, transport, treatment, generation, storage,
disposal, Release or threatened Release of Hazardous Substances. BCHI has
provided to the Company all material environmental site assessments, audits,
investigations and studies in their possession, custody or control relating
to property or assets currently or formerly owned, leased, operated or used
by BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary. Neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has
been in business other than those related to the provision of communication
services that would reasonably be expected to present environmental issues of
a materially different scope or magnitude than those presented in the
provision of communication services. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither BCHI nor any BCHI Subsidiary has operated or currently
operates (i) any manufacturing facilities, (ii) any facilities that are or
have been permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or
(iii) any business that manages the hazardous wastes of any unrelated party.
The representations contained in the immediately prior sentence of this
Section 4.11 shall not be deemed to be breached unless the operation or
ownership of such other business or businesses has resulted in any material
cost, liability or obligation of BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary under any
Environmental Law.

(v) a Contract relating to indebtedness for borrowed money or any financial

terms of any BCHI Material Contract in any material respect. To
the knowledge of BCHI, no other party to any BCHI Material Contract is in
breach of or default under the terms of any BCHI Material Contract in any
material respect. Each BCHI Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the
knowledge of BCHI, is in full force and effect, subject to (A) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors'
rights generally and (B) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity). True,
correct and complete copies of each BCHI Material Contract (including all
modifications and amendments thereto and waivers thereunder) have been made

34

revoked, cancelled or adversely modified. No BCHI License is subject to
(i) any conditions or requirements that have not been imposed generally upon
licenses in the same service, unless such conditions or requirements are set
forth on the face of the applicable authorization, or (ii) any pending
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity, including the FCC, State
PSCs, the CRTC or other Canadian Authorities to suspend, revoke or cancel

of the Equity Interests and controls all of the voting power and decision-
making authority of each licensee of the BCHI Licenses. No BCHI License,
Order or other agreement, obtained from, issued by or concluded with any
State PSC would impose restrictions on the ability of any BCHI Subsidiary to
make payments, dividends or other distributions to BCHI or any BCHI
Subsidiary that limits, or would reasonably be expected to limit, the cash
funding and management alternatives of BCHI on a consolidated basis in a
manner disproportionate to restrictions applied by other State PSCs.

Section 6.2 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting

 

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but no
later than thirty (30) days after binding commitments in respect of
the Financing (or, if Alternative Financing is being used, the Alternative
Financing) have been entered into by a Financing Source), the Company will
file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company will use reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement disseminated to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable after such filing is cleared by the SEC, and in
any event no later than seven (7) Business Days after the Proxy Statement is
cleared by the SEC. BCHI will furnish to the Company all information
concerning itself and its Subsidiaries, and provide such other assistance
(including using reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in preparing
pro forma financial information required to be included in the Proxy
Statement), as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement by the Company.

 

 

(b) Each Party agrees that none of the information supplied by such Party for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement shall, on
the date mailed to the stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

 

 

 

 

44

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Company will provide BCHI with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement, and will incorporate the reasonable
comments of BCHI therein; provided, that no filing or mailing of,
or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without BCHI's prior written consent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company will, as promptly
as practicable after receipt thereof, provide BCHI with copies of any written
comments and advise BCHI of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, in cooperation with BCHI, to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

 

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time (i) any change occurs with
respect to the Parties, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors
or officers, or (ii) any information relating to the Parties, or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, is discovered by any of
the Parties, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
Party that observes such change or discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party, and the Company shall file as promptly as practicable
with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement describing such change or information and, as required by
Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement
to the shareholders of the Company.

 

 

(e) The Company will take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (the "Stockholders
Meeting"), on a date as promptly as practicable after the SEC has
authorized distribution of and has advised the Company that it has no
comments or additional comments on the Proxy Statement, for the purpose
of obtaining the Stockholder Approval and shall take all lawful action to
solicit and obtain the Stockholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.3(c),
the Company Board will recommend to the stockholders of the Company
the adoption of this Agreement. The Company may only postpone or adjourn the
Stockholder's Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, and
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined
after consultation with outside legal counsel is reasonably likely to
be required under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by stockholders of
the Company prior to the Stockholders Meeting. The only matters to be voted
upon at the Stockholders Meeting are (i) the Merger and this Agreement,
including the amendment and restatement of the Company's Charter, the
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and (to
the extent necessary to comply with NASDAQ listing requirements) the Reverse
Split (ii) any adjournment or postponement of the Stockholders Meeting and
(iii) any other matters as are required by applicable Law.

 

 

Section 6.3 No Solicitation or Change of Recommendation

 

 

(a) No Solicitation.

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 6.3(a)(ii) and Section 6.3(a)(iii),
the Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective officers, managers or directors will, and that they
will instruct and cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives
(collectively, the "Company Non-Solicit Parties") not to, directly or
indirectly:

 

 

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries,
discussions regarding, or the making or submission of, any proposal, request
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Alternative Proposal;

 

 

 

 

 

45

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than
BCHI) concerning any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract concerning
an Alternative Proposal (other than negotiating and entering into
a confidentiality agreement as described in Section 6.3(a)(iii))
(an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement");

 

 

(C) terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to enforce any provision of,
or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any
standstill, confidentiality or similar Contract entered into by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary in respect of or in contemplation of an Alternative
Proposal (other than to the extent the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
failure to take any such actions under this Section 6.3(a)(i)(C) would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' duties or
obligations under applicable Law);

 

 

(D) conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations to facilitate any proposal that constitutes an Alternative
Proposal;

 

 

(E) furnish any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, or afford access to the books or records
or Representatives of any of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
to any third party that, to the knowledge of the Company, after consultation
with its Representatives, is seeking to make, or has made, an Alternative
Proposal;

 

 

(F) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject
to the conditions in Section 6.3(a)(iii) and solely in response to a Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Stockholder Approval, the Company Non-Solicit Parties may, with
respect to the Person that has made such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal:

 

 

(A) provide information or afford access to the books and records or
Representatives of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; and

 

 

(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such
Person (and its Representatives) with respect to such Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal.

 

 

 

 

 

46

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) The Company may not take the actions described in Section 6.3(a)(ii)
unless, prior to taking any such action:

 

 

(A) the Company has (1) received from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (and compliant with the last sentence
of Section 6.3(g)); provided that such confidentiality agreement (x) shall
not be required to contain standstill provisions and (y) shall not
contain any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying
with its obligation to provide the required disclosure to BCHI pursuant to
this Section 6.3, and (2) disclosed to BCHI (and, if
applicable, contemporaneously provided copies of) any non-public information
to be provided to such Person and any books or records to which such Person
will be afforded access, in each case, to the extent not previously provided
to BCHI;

 

 

(B) the Company has delivered to BCHI written notice prior to taking any such
action (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such action,
(2) stating that the Company Board has made the determination set forth in
Section 6.3(a)(iii)(C) and (3) including an unredacted copy of such Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal (including any materials relating to such Person's
proposed equity and debt financing, if any) and an executed copy of the
confidentiality agreement described in Section 6.3(a)(iii)(A); and

 

 

(C) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial and legal advisors that (1) such Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' duties or obligations under applicable Law.

 

 

(b) No Change of Recommendation. Except as set forth in Section 6.3(c), the
Company will not, and will cause the other Company Non-Solicit Parties
not to:

 

 

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to BCHI, the Company
Board Recommendation;

 

 

(ii) fail to announce publicly, within ten (10) Business Days after a
tender offer or exchange offer relating to any securities of the Company has
been commenced, that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer;

 

 

(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
notice distributed to the stockholders of the Company pursuant
to Section 6.2(e);

 

 

(iv) approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

 

 

 

 

 

47

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any such
prohibited action described in Section 6.3(b)(i) through this Section
6.3(b)(v) being referred to as a "Change of Recommendation");

 

 

 provided that the making of any determination of the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Change
of Recommendation Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement will
not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

 

 

(c) Certain Permitted Changes of Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.3(d),
at any time prior to receiving the Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
in response to a Superior Proposal may effect, or cause the Company
to effect, as the case may be, a Change of Recommendation if: (i)
the Company Board determines that after complying with Section 6.3(d), a Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside financial and legal advisors, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors' duties or obligations
under applicable Law.

 

 

(d) Procedure Prior to Changes in the Recommendation. The Company Board will
be entitled to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Change of
Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent
permitted under Section 6.3(c)), only if (A) the Company shall have
delivered to BCHI a written notice (a "Change of Recommendation Notice") (1)
stating that the Company Board intends to take such actions pursuant to
Section 6.3(c), (2) stating that the Company Board has made the
determinations set forth in Sections 6.3(c)(i) and 6.3(c)(ii) and (3)
including an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal and unredacted form of
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such Superior Proposal
(including any materials relating to such Person's proposed equity and debt
financing, if any) and (B) the Negotiation Period shall have expired. During
the five (5) Business Day period commencing on the date of BCHI's receipt of
such Change of Recommendation Notice (such period, as may be extended
pursuant to this Section 7.3(d), the "Negotiation Period"), the Company will
engage, and will cause its Representatives to be available for the purpose of
engaging, in good faith negotiations with BCHI (to the extent BCHI desires
to negotiate) regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that
the Alternative Proposal that is the subject of the Change of Recommendation
Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Each time the financial or other
material terms or conditions of such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal (or terms
or conditions related thereto, such as the proposed equity and debt
financing) are amended or modified, the Company will be required to deliver
to BCHI a new Change of Recommendation Notice (including, as attachments
thereto, amended forms of the written Alternative Acquisition
Agreements relating to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal) and
the Negotiation Period will be extended by an additional two (2) Business
Days from the date of BCHI's receipt of such new Change of Recommendation
Notice.

 

 

(e) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 will
be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its required disclosure
obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Alternative Proposal
or making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
the directors' duties or obligations under applicable Law; provided, however,
that neither the Company nor the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
will affect any Change of Recommendation, except in accordance with Section
6.3(c) and Section 6.3(d); and provided, further, that in no event will
any "Stop-Look-and-Listen" communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation or to violate
this Section 6.3. Disclosure of the type described in this Section 6.3(e)
(other than the type described in the second proviso of the foregoing
sentence) that is not an express rejection of any Alternative Proposal or an
express confirmation that the Company Board Recommendation remains in effect
will be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

 

 

(f) Existing Discussions. The Company will, and will cause the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, managers and
directors and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with, or any solicitation or intentional assistance
or encouragement of, any Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal (or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Alternative
Proposal) which are on-going as of the date of this Agreement and request
that any such Person promptly return or destroy (and confirm destruction of)
all confidential information concerning the Company and any Company
Subsidiary. The Company will take the necessary steps to promptly inform, on
the date of this Agreement, the individuals or entities referred to in the
preceding sentence of this Section 6.3(f).

 

 

 

 

 

48

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Notice. Without limiting anything in this Section 6.3, the Company
will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify BCHI orally and in
writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an Alternative
Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (other than requests for information in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an
Alternative Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations
with respect to an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of such
discussions, proposals, offers or requests, and including in the written
version of such notice, an unredacted copy of any written (including via
electronic transmission) proposals, offers or requests, in each case,
including any amendments or modifications thereto. The Company will promptly
(and, in any event, within 24 hours after any amendment or modification of,
or development with respect to, any such, proposal, offer, request
or Alternative Proposal, or at the reasonable request of BCHI) notify BCHI
orally and in writing of the status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers
or requests, including any material developments, notifications, amendments
or modifications thereto and furnish to BCHI copies of any written inquiries,
correspondence and draft documentation in connection with such discussions,
proposals, offers or requests. The Company will not, and will cause
its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, enter into
any Contract that would prohibit them from providing the
information required to be provided to BCHI pursuant to this Section 6.3(g).

 

 

Section 6.4 Access to Information

 

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice, BCHI and the Company will, and will cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to BCHI or the Company,
as applicable, and to their respective officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, lenders, financial advisors and other Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time to all their respective owned or leased properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, personnel (including contractors and
distributors), records, Tax Returns, work papers and all other
information concerning its business, operations, status of compliance
with Environmental Law, properties and personnel as BCHI or the Company, as
applicable, may reasonably request; except that each of BCHI and the Company,
as applicable, and its Representatives will conduct any such activities in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of BCHI or the Company, as applicable, and their respective
Subsidiaries; except further that neither BCHI nor the Company, as
applicable, or their respective Subsidiaries will be required to provide any
access or disclose any information if such access or disclosure
would contravene any applicable Law or where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or contravene any fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; except further
that the foregoing shall not require BCHI or the Company to permit any
inspection or to disclose any information that in the reasonable judgement of
BCHI or the Company, as the case may be, would result in the disclosure of
any trade secrets of third parties.

 

 

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
May 18, 2017, by and among the Company, Birch Equity Partners, LLC and Birch
Communications, Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

 

 

(c) No investigation by either of the Parties or their respective
Representatives will affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.5 Employee Matters

 

 

(a) After the Closing Date through the date of termination for the applicable
BCHI Employee, the Company will provide, and will cause its Affiliates to
provide, each employee of BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary as of the Closing Date
who is employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date (the "BCHI Employees") with such employee compensation and
benefits as the Company or its Affiliate (as applicable), in its sole
discretion considers to be appropriate, subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.5 and applicable Law.

 

 

 

 

 

49

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) To the extent commercially reasonable, and without duplication of any
benefits, the Company (i) will give, and cause its Affiliates to give, each
BCHI Employee the same service credit under any Company Benefit Plan that
covers such BCHI Employee after the Closing Date as would have been granted
to such BCHI Employee by BCHI or any BCHI Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to
the Closing under any comparable BCHI Benefit Plan, for all purposes
(including eligibility to participate, vesting in eligible benefits and
levels of benefits) other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined
benefit pension plan, (ii) will give, and cause its Affiliates to give, each
BCHI Employee service credit granted by the Company or its Subsidiary, as
applicable, under any Company Benefit Plan that covers such BCHI Employee
after the Closing Date for service prior to the Closing, based upon the
provisions of such Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of entitlement to
benefits thereunder (except for purposes of benefits accrual under a
defined benefits pension plan), (iii) will allow, and cause its
Affiliates to allow, such BCHI Employees to participate in each
Company Benefit Plan providing welfare benefits (including medical,
life insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance and long-term
care insurance) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs without regard
to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations, and (iv) will credit, and
cause its Affiliates to credit, the BCHI Employees with any expenses incurred
within the year in which the Closing Date occurs, but prior to the
Closing Date, that were credited by BCHI pursuant to the comparable
BCHI Benefit Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-pays
and other applicable limits under the Company Benefit Plans, in which they
participate and any similar replacement plans.

 

 

(c) For the period of the year in which the Closing occurs that is after the
Closing Date, the Company will continue, and cause its Affiliates
to continue, to credit to each BCHI Employee all vacation and
personal holiday time that such BCHI Employee has accrued but not
used through the Closing Date and is entitled to use as of the Closing Date,
subject to the Company's vacation day carryover policy.

 

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement will create any right or obligation which is
enforceable by any employee, former employee, BCHI Employee or any other
Person with respect to any terms or conditions of employment, including, but
not limited to, the benefits and compensation described in this Section 6.5.
For the avoidance of doubt, any amendments to the Company's, the Company
Subsidiaries', and the Surviving Company's benefit and compensation plans,
programs or arrangements will occur only in accordance with their respective
terms and will be pursuant to action taken by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Company which are independent of the
consummation of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder.
Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be construed as prohibiting the Company or
its Affiliates from terminating any BCHI Employee's employment as the Company
or such Affiliate determines appropriate in its sole discretion, subject to
the terms of any employment agreement and applicable Law.

 

 

Section 6.6 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

 

 

(a) From the Effective Time, the Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by
advancing expenses) each current and former director, officer and employee
of (i) BCHI and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"DandO Indemnified Parties") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative) (each, a "Claim"), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to their
position with BCHI or its Subsidiaries, or the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at
the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the
Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law. Each of (x) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws and the
respective organizational documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries as
currently in effect, and (y) any indemnification agreements with a DandO
Indemnified Party listed on Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter
or Section 6.6(a) of the BCHI Disclosure Letter, which will in each case
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, will not, from and after the Effective Time,
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified Parties except, in the
case of clauses (x) and (y), as required by applicable Law. Without limiting
the foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will, and the
Company will cause the Surviving Company to cause the certificate of
formation and limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company to
include provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
the DandO Indemnified Parties no less favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties
than as set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws in effect on the
date of this Agreement, which provisions will, from and after the Effective
Time, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified Parties except
as required by applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if it is unable to,
the Company will cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from the Company's
current insurance carrier, as applicable, or from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as such current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (the "DandO Insurance") for the persons who, as of the date
of this Agreement, are covered by either BCHI's existing DandO Insurance or
the Company's existing DandO Insurance, as applicable. Such "tail" insurance
policies will have terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at
least as favorable as BCHI's existing DandO Insurance, with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions);
except that the maximum aggregate premium for such insurance policies
for any such year will not be in excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company
will cause the Surviving Company to maintain such "tail" insurance policies
in full force and effect for their full term. If Company for any reason fails
to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company will, and the Company will cause the Surviving Company
to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the DandO Indemnified
Parties, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, each of BCHI's DandO Insurance and the Company's DandO Insurance, as
applicable, in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
provided in the respective existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving Company
will, and the Company will cause the Surviving Company to, purchase the best
available DandO Insurance for such six(6)-year period from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as BCHI's current insurance carrier
with respect to its existing DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and with levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided
in BCHI's existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; except that
the Surviving Company will not be required to pay an aggregate premium for
such insurance policies in excess of 150% of the annual premium paid by BCHI
for coverage for its last full fiscal year for such insurance (the "Maximum
Premium"); and if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Company will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

 

(d) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Company and the Surviving Company will assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this Section 6.6.

 

 

Section 6.7 NASDAQ Listing; Reverse Split . The Company will use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Company Common Stock issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, as
promptly as practicable after date of this Agreement, and in any event prior
to the Closing Date. To the extent necessary to comply with NASDAQ listing
requirements, the Company shall submit to the holders of Company Common Stock
at the Stockholders' Meeting a proposal to approve and adopt an amendment to
the Company Certificate of Incorporation to authorize the Company Board to
effect a five-to-one reverse split of all outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, such that each holder of shares of Company Common Stock shall
receive one share of Company Common Stock for every five shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder (the "Reverse Split"), effective prior to
the Effective Time.

Section 6.8 Advice of Changes . Each of BCHI and the Company will promptly
advise the other of any change or event, of which it has knowledge, (a)
having or reasonably likely to have a BCHI Material Adverse Effect or
a Company Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (b) that would or
would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of
its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement if
it would result in the failure of closing conditions in Section 7.3(a)
or Section 7.3(b) or Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), respectively, by
the Outside Date, except that (i) no such notification will affect the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Parties (or remedies with
respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under
this Agreement and (ii) a failure to comply with this Section 6.8 will
not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to
be satisfied unless the underlying BCHI Material Adverse Effect, Company
Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.

 

 

Section 6.9 Control of the Other Party's Business . Nothing contained in
this Agreement will give BCHI, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or will
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of BCHI or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of BCHI and the Company will exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 

 

Section 6.10 Subsidiary Compliance . The Company, as the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, will cause Merger Sub to comply
with and perform all of its obligations under or relating to this Agreement
prior to the Effective Time and to consummate the Transactions on the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

Section 6.11 Financing

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, BCHI and the
Company will use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the financing in
an aggregate amount necessary to effect the Refinancing, and to otherwise
complete the Transactions, including paying expenses associated with the
Transactions, which financing will be on the terms and conditions
satisfactory to BCHI and the Company, each in its sole and absolute
discretion (the "Financing"). BCHI and the Company will each use its
reasonable best efforts to (I) negotiate and enter into commitments for, and
then definitive agreements with respect to, the Financing as promptly as
practicable (such commitments and definitive agreements, the "Financing
Agreements"), (II) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the
Marketing Period) all conditions in the Financing Agreements applicable
to BCHI and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries to obtaining the
Financing as promptly as practicable, (III) consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing and (IV) enforce the counterparties' obligations and its
rights under the Financing Agreements, including by suit or other
appropriate proceeding to cause the lenders under the Financing to fund
in accordance with their respective commitments if all conditions to funding
the Financing in the applicable Financing Agreements have been satisfied or
waived. BCHI and the Company will keep each other reasonably informed on a
timely basis of the status of its respective efforts to arrange the Financing
and to satisfy the conditions thereof. If any portion of the amount of the
Financing becomes reasonably likely to be unavailable on the material
terms and conditions contemplated by the applicable Financing
Agreements, each of BCHI and the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing
from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate
the Transactions with terms and conditions not materially less favorable,
taken as a whole, to the Parties than the terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable Financing Agreements ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
final day of the Marketing Period. In such event, (1) the term "Financing"
will be deemed to include the Alternative Financing, and (2) the term
"Financing Agreements" will be deemed to include any commitment letters and
definitive agreement with respect to the Alternative
Financing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.11 or in any
other provision of this Agreement, in no event will the Parties be required
(i) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or of the
Financing Agreements or (ii) to consummate the Closing any earlier than
required under clause (b) of the first sentence of Section 1.3.

(b) Each Party will provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries to provide, and
will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to
provide, all cooperation that is customary and necessary in connection
with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Financing and causing
the conditions in the Financing Agreements to be satisfied, including using
reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with, and designating one or more
members of senior management of the Company to participate in, the
preparation of customary offering and syndication documents and materials,
including, including private placement or offering memoranda, bank
information memoranda, bank syndication material and packages, lender and
investor presentations, rating agency materials and presentations

Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders
and containing customary information (all such documents and materials,
collectively, the "Offering Documents"), (ii) preparing and furnishing to the
Financing Sources as promptly as practicable all Required Information to the
extent it is available to such Party and all other information and
disclosures relating to such Party and its Subsidiaries (including
their businesses, operations, financial projections and prospects) as may be
reasonably necessary in preparation of the Offering Documents (including
execution of customary authorization and management representation letters),
(iii) designating one or more members of senior management of such Party to
participate in a reasonable number of due diligence sessions in connection
with the Financing, including direct contact between such senior management
and the Financing Sources and potential lenders in the Financing,
drafting sessions, management presentations, rating agency
presentations, lender meetings and one or more road shows, (iv) requesting
such Party's independent auditors to cooperate in obtaining customary
accountant's comfort letters and consents from such Party's independent
auditors, (v) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering,
definitive financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents,
hedging agreements and other certificates and documents (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of such Party and
its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters before giving effect to
the Financing or the consummation of the Transactions), (vi) subject to any
contractual agreement in effect, facilitating the pledging of collateral for
the Financing, including taking commercially reasonable actions necessary to
permit the Financing Sources to evaluate such Party and its Subsidiaries'
real property and current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and establishing, as of the Effective Time, bank and other
accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox arrangements in
connection with the Financing, (vii) obtaining from such Party's existing
lenders such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be
reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing and collateral
arrangements, including customary payoff letters, lien releases, instruments
of termination or discharge, (viii) preparing any supplements to the above
information as may be required pursuant to the Financing Agreements and (ix)
cooperating with the other Parties to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
Financing to the extent within the control of such Party and its
Subsidiaries, and taking all corporate or limited liability company actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably necessary to
permit the consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof
to be made available to the Company and the Surviving Company immediately
upon the Effective Time. In connection with the foregoing, the Company will
file with the SEC all Company Reports for the annual and quarterly fiscal
periods ending on and after the date hereof as soon as practicable but in any
event not later than (i) 90 days following the end of the Company's fiscal
year, in the case of annual reports on Form 10-K and (ii) 45 days following
the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company, in the case of quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q. Each of the Company and BCHI hereby consent to the use
of their and their respective Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the
Financing in a form and manner agreed with the Party whose logo is being
used; except that such logos are to be used solely in a manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Party whose logo is
being used or the reputation or goodwill of such Party. Each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information
(to the extent it is available) to be included in any Offering Document to be
used in connection with such Financing such that any such
Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading.

Section 6.12 Transaction Litigation . Each Party will give the other Party
prompt notice of any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company or
to the knowledge of BCHI, as the case may be, threatened, against the such
Party or its directors, officers, managers, partners or Affiliates
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
(collectively, "Transaction Litigation"). The Parties will consult with each
other regarding the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and
neither Party will compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
Transaction Litigation or consent to the same, without the prior written
consent of the other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In connection with any Transaction Litigation and
the Parties' performance of their obligations under this Section 6.12, BCHI
and the Company will enter into a customary common interest or joint defense
agreement or implement such other techniques as reasonably required to
preserve any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege;
except that no Party will be required to provide information if doing so, in
the opinion of its legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege; except that, if any
information is withheld pursuant to the foregoing exception, such Party
will inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is
being withheld and the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to
enable the informing Party to provide such information without causing
the loss of any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege.

 

 

Section 6.13 Publicity . The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement will be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by BCHI and the Company. Following such initial press release,
none of the Parties will, and neither the Company nor BCHI will permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or
similar public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public
statement concerning, the Transactions without the prior consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of BCHI,
in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by the Company, or the
Company, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by BCHI;
except that either of BCHI or the Company may, without the prior consent of
the other (but after prior consultation with the other to the extent
practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent such Party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law. The restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.13 will not apply to any release or public statement
in connection with any dispute between BCHI and the Company regarding this
Agreement or the Transactions; except that the foregoing will not limit the
ability of any Party to make internal announcements to their
respective employees and other stockholders that are not inconsistent in
any material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding
the Transactions.

applicable to the Transactions, the Company and BCHI, including the Company
Board and the board of directors of BCHI, will grant such approvals and take
such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated

Takeover Law on the Merger.

Section 9.2 Interpretation

 

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits, Schedules or Disclosure Letters, such reference will be to an
Article or Section of or Exhibit, Schedule or Disclosure Letter to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Unless the context otherwise requires, (i) "or" is disjunctive
but not necessarily exclusive, (ii) words in the singular include the plural
and vice versa, and (iii) the use in this Agreement of a pronoun in reference
to a Party hereto includes the masculine, feminine or neuter, as the context
may require. References to statutes include all regulations promulgated
thereunder and references to statutes or regulations will be construed
as including all statutory and regulatory provisions consolidating, amending
or replacing the statute or regulation.

 

 

(b) The Company Disclosure Letter and BCHI Disclosure Letter as well as all
other schedules and all exhibits hereto, will be deemed part of
this Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement.
The representations and warranties of BCHI and the Company are made
and given, and the covenants are agreed to, subject to the disclosures and
exceptions set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter and BCHI Disclosure
Letter. In no event will the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure
Letter or BCHI Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope
the respective Party's representations, warranties or covenants set forth in
this Agreement. All attachments to the Company Disclosure Letter and BCHI
Disclosure Letter are incorporated by reference into the Company Disclosure
Letter and BCHI Disclosure Letter, respectively, in which they are directly
or indirectly referenced. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the mere inclusion of an item therein as an exception to
a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or BCHI Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be.

 

 

(c) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 9.3 Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and
will become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that
each Party need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 

Section 9.4 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries . This
Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to in
this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, (a)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement, (b) is not intended to confer on any
Person, other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies hereunder, except (i) as provided in Section
6.6 (which is intended for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties, each
of whom will be a third party beneficiary of Section 6.6) and (ii) for the
Financing Sources and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns (each of which will be a third party beneficiary with
respect to their respective rights under this Section 9.4, Section 9.8
and Section 9.11). None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to
the Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any
rights or claims against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or
thereunder. In no event will the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

 

 

 

 

 

62

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.5 Amendment . Subject to compliance with applicable Law, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the
Stockholder Vote by written agreement signed by each of the Parties; except
that, after receipt of the Stockholder Vote, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of
this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to
be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Shares, other than as
contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 

 

Section 9.6 Extension; Waiver . At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Company (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub), by action taken or
authorized by the Company Board and by the board of directors of BCHI, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement, except that, after any approval of the
Transactions by the stockholders of the Company, there may not be,
without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver
of this Agreement or any portion hereof that reduces the amount or changes
the form of the consideration to be delivered to the holders of Shares under
this Agreement, other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Any agreement
on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with
an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

 

Section 9.7 Governing Law . This Agreement will be governed and construed
in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to any applicable conflict of laws principles (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction).

 

 

Section 9.8 Jurisdiction

 

 

(a) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and, in the absence of
such jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware, and, in the absence of such federal jurisdiction, the parties
consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state
court sitting in New Castle County (together, the "Chosen Courts"), in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Chosen
Courts, (ii) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts, and any
appellate court hearing actions or proceedings therefrom, (iii) waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts. Each of
the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

 

 

 

 

63

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will
not bring any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing
Agreements or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable
law, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts of the State of
New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the Parties agrees that a
final judgment in any such action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

 

 

(c) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 9.8(c).

 

 

Section 9.9 Assignment . Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties and any attempt to do so will be null and void; except
that each of BCHI, the Company and Merger Sub may assign its rights
and obligations hereunder to the Financing Sources providing the Financing
pursuant to the terms thereof to the extent necessary for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of such Financing, but no such assignment will release any assigning
Party from its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

 

 

Section 9.10 Specific Performance . The Parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof (including the obligation of the Parties to consummate
the Merger) in the Chosen Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, and
that such explicit rights to specific enforcement are an integral part of the
Transactions and, without such rights, neither the Company nor BCHI would
have entered into this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity.

 

 

Section 9.11 Waivers . Any failure of any of the Parties to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the
Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof, except in the case of any
express waiver of Section 9.4, Section 9.8, Section 9.10, and this Section
9.11 which is, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to
any Financing Source, which waiver will only be effective with respect to
such Financing Source if such Financing Source has consented thereto or to
the extent that the consent of such Financing Source is not required to be
obtained under the applicable provisions of the Financing Agreements relating
to waivers of this Agreement, only by a written instrument signed by the
Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition will
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

 

 

 

 

 

64

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.12 No Survival of Representations and Warranties  . The
representations and warranties of contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

 

 

Section 9.13 Severability . If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, such term, provision, covenant
or restriction will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to
render it valid, effective and enforceable, and the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 

 

Section 9.14 Non-Recourse . Except for any claim or cause of action arising
under or related to any Support Agreement, any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be
brought against Persons that are expressly named as Parties, and then
only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. Except for
any liability or obligation arising under or related to any Support
Agreement, no former, current or future direct or indirect equityholders,
controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, members,
managers, agents, trustees, Affiliates, general or limited partners or
assignees of the Parties (except permitted assignees under Section 9.9) or of
any former, current or future direct or indirect equityholder,
controlling Person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member,
manager, agent, trustee, Affiliate, general or limited partner or
assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, but for the avoidance
of doubt excluding the Parties) will have any liability or obligation for
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or for any Action based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate any of the Transactions), in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of
any assessment, by any legal or equitable Action, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by
or through a claim by or on behalf of a Party hereto or another Person or

 the provisions, if any, pursuant to which the shares of such series
are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class
or classes or of any other series of the same or any other class or classes
of stock, or any other security, of the Company or any other corporation or
other entity, and the rates or other determinants of conversion or exchange

 any other relative, participating, optional, or other special

or restrictions thereof;

 

 

 all as may be determined from time to time by the Board and stated
or expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of
such Preferred Stock (collectively, a "Preferred Stock Designation").

 

 

 Common Stock. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote on
each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders for each share
of Common Stock held of record by such holder as of the record date for such
meeting.

 

 

 The Board may make, amend, and repeal the Bylaws of the Company; provided,
that nothing herein will limit the power of the stockholders of the Company
to make, amend and repeal Bylaws. Any Bylaw made by the Board under the
powers conferred hereby may be amended or repealed by the Board (except as
specified in any such Bylaw so made or amended) or by the stockholders in the
manner provided in the Bylaws of the Company. The Company may in its Bylaws
confer powers upon the Board in addition to the foregoing and in addition to
the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon the Board by applicable
law.

 

 

 Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock:

 

 

(a) any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Company may be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Company or without a meeting by means of any consent in
writing of such stockholders; and

 

 

(b) special meetings of stockholders of the Company may be called only (i) by
the Chairman of the Board (the "Chairman"), (ii) by the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company (the "Chief Executive Officer"), or (iii) by the
Secretary of the Company (the "Secretary") acting at the request of the
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, a majority of the total number of
Directors that the Company would have if there were no vacancies on the Board
(the "Whole Board"), or stockholders of the Company holding at least a
majority of voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock. For the purposes of
this Certificate of Incorporation, "Voting Stock" means stock of the Company
of any class or series entitled to vote generally in the election of
Directors.

 

 

 

 

 

A-2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 At any annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders of the
Company, only such business will be conducted or considered as has
been brought before such meeting in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the
Company.

 

 

 Number, Election, and Terms of Directors. Subject to the rights, if any, of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors
under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation, the number
of the Directors of the Company will not be less than one nor more than nine
and will be fixed from time to time by, or in the manner provided in, the
Bylaws of the Company. Subject to adjustment per the Bylaws, the number of
Directors as of the date of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation is fixed at nine. At each annual meeting of the stockholders of
the Company, the successors to the Directors whose term expires at
that meeting will be elected by plurality vote of all votes cast at
such meeting to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting
of stockholders held in the year following the year of their election and
until their successors are elected and qualified. Election of Directors of
the Company need not be by written ballot unless requested by the presiding
officer or by the holders of a majority of the Voting Stock present in person
or represented by proxy at a meeting of the stockholders at which Directors
are to be elected. If authorized by the Board, such requirement of a written
ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission,
provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.

 

 

 Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies. Subject to the rights, if any,
of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional Directors
under circumstances specified in a Preferred Stock Designation,
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number
of Directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from
death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause will be filled
solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors then
in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or by a sole
remaining Director. Any Director elected in accordance with the preceding
sentence will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the Director
whose seat is being filled and until such Director's successor has been
elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of Directors
constituting the Board may shorten the term of any incumbent Director.

 

 

 To the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law
and any other applicable law currently or hereafter in effect, no Director
of the Company will be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders
for or with respect to any breach of fiduciary duty or other act or omission
as a Director of the Company. No repeal or modification of this Article VIII
will adversely affect the protection of any Director of the Company provided
hereby in relation to any breach of fiduciary duty or other act or
omission as a Director of the Company occurring prior to the
effectiveness of such repeal or modification.

 

 

 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise subject to or involved in
any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Company or is
or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another company or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall
be indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted or required by
the Delaware General Corporation Law and any other applicable law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to
provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Company
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith ("Indemnifiable Losses"); provided,
however, that, except as provided in Section 4 of this Article IX with
respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company
shall indemnify any such Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 1 in connection
with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such
Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

 

 

 Right to Advancement of Expenses. The right to indemnification conferred in
Section 1 of this Article IX shall include the right to advancement by
the Company of any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in defending any
such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an "Advancement
of Expenses"); provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation
Law so requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his
or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including without
limitation service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made pursuant to
this Section 2 only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking
(an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay, without
interest, all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by
final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal
(a "Final Adjudication") that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2. An Indemnitee's right to
an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Section 2 is not subject to the
satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not conditioned upon any prior
determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under Section 1
of this Article IX with respect to the related Proceeding or the absence of
any prior determination to the contrary.

 

 

 

 

 

A-3

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Contract Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of
Expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article IX shall be contract
rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to
be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

 

 

 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this
Article IX is not paid in full by the Company within 60 calendar days after
a written claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a
claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period
shall be 20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If
successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the
Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of
an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to the fullest
extent permitted or required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to
provide broader reimbursements of prosecution or defense expenses than such
law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to
an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit
brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the
terms of an Undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to recover such
expenses, without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Company
(including its Board of Directors or a committee thereof, its stockholders
or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, its stockholders or independent legal counsel) that
the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create
a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses hereunder pursuant to the
terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be
on the Company.

 

 

 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article IX shall not be exclusive
of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under
any statute, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Nothing
contained in this Article IX shall limit or otherwise affect any such other
right or the Company's power to confer any such other right.

 

 

 Insurance. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

 

 No Duplication of Payments. The Company shall not be liable under this
Article IX to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of any
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection therewith
and any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under any
insurance policy or from any other source in respect of such Indemnifiable
Losses.

this Section 2.1(b), then the Company will provide written notice of
such failure to Holding LLC or the FTI Nominating Committee, as applicable.
If such failure is not cured within ten (10) Business Days following the
transmission of such notice by the Company, then the Board will be entitled
to designate a nominee for such position. The rights of each of Holdings LLC
and the FTI Nominating Committee to designate nominees for election to the
Board as set forth in this Section 2.1(b) are personal to each of Holdings
LLC and the FTI Nominating Committee and may not be exercised by any
Transferee, except that in the event Holding LLC no longer holds any
Common Stock but its Affiliates continue to hold Common Stock Transferred by
Holding LLC to such Affiliates (whether directly or by Transfers through
other Affiliates of Holding LLC), and such rights have not been terminated
pursuant to Section 2.1(e), the rights of Holdings LLC to designate nominees
pursuant to this Section 2.1(b) may be exercised by the Affiliates of Holding
LLC to which such Common Stock was Transferred.

for election to the Board pursuant to Section 2.1(b), the Company, by action
of the remaining Directors, shall, and the Stockholders agree with the
Company to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the remaining Directors
to, fill the vacancy created thereby with a replacement nominee designated by
the entity (i.e., either Holding LLC or the FTI Nominating Committee) that
had designated such Director for nomination pursuant to Section 2.1(b) as
promptly as practicable. If such vacant position had been held by a
Person nominated under Section 2.1(b)(iii), then the nomination of the
replacement nominee shall be subject to the prior written approval of the
FTI Nominating Committee, in accordance with Section 2.1(b)(iii).

 

 

(ii) In the event that a vacancy is created at any time by the
death, disability, retirement, resignation or removal of any
Director nominated for election to the Board pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and
the remaining Directors have not caused the vacancy created thereby to be
filled pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(i) by a new designee of the appropriate
Person promptly after both Holding LLC and the FTI Nominating Committee have
been notified of such vacancy, then in such case the Company shall take all
such actions as and when requested by whichever of Holding LLC or the
FTI Nominating Committee is entitled, pursuant to Section 2.1(b) to designate
a Person to fill such vacancy (the "Designating Stockholder"), and each
other Stockholder hereby agrees with the Company to vote, or act by written
consent with respect to, all Voting Securities beneficially owned by it on
the date of the relevant vote or action to act to fill the vacancy with a
Person designated as a replacement by the Designating Stockholder in
accordance with Section 2.1(b). Upon the written request of any Person having
rights under Section 2.1(b), each other Stockholder agrees with the Company
to vote, or act by written consent with respect to, all Voting Securities
beneficially owned by it on the date of the relevant action to, remove any
Director nominated by such Person for election to the Board pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) and to elect any replacement Director designated for
nomination by such Person pursuant to this Section 2.1(d).

 

 

(iii) Subject to Section 2.1(e), unless otherwise requested in writing by
the Person entitled to nominate such Person for election to the Board under
Section 2.1(b), no other Stockholder shall take any action to cause the
removal of any Directors nominated by such Person for election to the
Board pursuant to Section 2.1(b); provided, that any Director may be removed
by the Board for Cause and, in such case, the resulting vacancy will
be filled with a Person designated as a replacement by the

majority of the Board, in accordance with the Bylaws and applicable
nomination procedures of the Company.

 

 

(e) Termination of Rights of Nomination.

 

 

(i) Upon such time as Holding LLC and its Affiliates cease to beneficially
own, collectively, at least 20% of the number of shares of Common Stock they
collectively beneficially own immediately following the Closing, Holding
LLC shall cease to have the right to designate any nominee for election to
the Board pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

 

 

(ii) Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Holding LLC and the FTI
Nominating Committee, upon such time as the aggregate number of issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Marvin Rosen
and Matt Rosen is less than that number of shares of Common Stock equal to
1.5% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, the FTI
Nominating Committee shall cease to have the right to designate any nominee
for election to the Board pursuant to Section 2.1(b).

 

 

  Company Cooperation. The Company shall take such action as may
be required under applicable Law, the Charter and the Bylaws (subject to
such vote of the Board as may be required) (a) to cause the Board to consist
of the number of Directors specified in Section 2.1(a) and (b) to cause one
of the Directors to be appointed and serve as the Chairman of the Board and
another of the Directors to be appointed and serve as the Vice Chairman of
the Board in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The Company agrees to include
in the slate of nominees to be voted upon by stockholders of the Company the
Persons designated for nomination to the Board in accordance with Section
2.1(b). The Company agrees that no modification or amendment of the Charter
or the Bylaws that is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement shall be effective without the approval of Holding LLC and the
FTI Nominating Committee.

 

 

  FTI Nominating Committee. The FTI Nominating Committee will only take
such actions under this Agreement as authorized in writing (email being
sufficient), including the nomination of individuals for election to the
Board by the FTI Nominating Committee pursuant to Section 2.1(b)(ii), by a
majority of the FTI Nominating Committee.

 

 

  FTI Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at
such time as any Person shall cease to serve as an FTI Director for any
reason, such Person shall no longer be an FTI Stockholder within the meaning
of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of such Person under this
Agreement shall terminate at such time. At such time as any Person shall be
elected as an FTI Director such Person shall become an FTI Stockholder within

Company and Holding LLC, of a duly executed joinder to this Agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A hereto or such other form approved by

Affiliate of such Stockholder, on the other, shall require the approval of a

  Specific Performance; Jurisdiction.

 

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur for which money
damages would not suffice in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached and that the parties would not have any adequate
remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that any non-breaching party shall be
entitled to seek an injunction, temporary restraining order or other
equitable relief exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery enjoining any
such breach and enforcing specifically the terms and provisions hereof, or in
the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware or another
court sitting in the state of Delaware. Each party agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party under
this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 4.11(a) are in addition to
any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law, in equity or
otherwise.

 

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding in connection with or with respect to this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement
of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or
assigns shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, or in the event (but only in the event) that such court does not
have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware or another
court sitting in the state of Delaware. The parties hereto further
agree that any dispute between the parties regarding the approval by the FTI
Nominating Committee of any Person designated by Holding LLC pursuant to
Section 2.1(b)(iii) will be submitted to the Delaware Court of Chancery with
a request to rule on an expedited basis. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action in connection with or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding in connection with or with respect to
this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this Section 4.11, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the service of any
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action in
connection with or relating to this Agreement, on behalf of itself or
its property, by the personal delivery of copies of such process to such
party or by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be
served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
Section 4.6. Nothing in this Section 4.11 shall affect the right of any
party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

 

  Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party (i) certifies and
acknowledges that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, and (ii)
acknowledges that it understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver and makes this waiver voluntarily, and that it and the other parties
have been induced to enter into the Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 4.12.

 

 

  Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  Certain Indemnification Matters. The Company hereby acknowledges that an
Indemnitee (as defined in the Charter) who is an officer, director, partner,
member, manager, employee, managing director or Affiliate of, or a Director
nominee pursuant to Section 2.1 of, a Stockholder (each such Indemnitee, a
"Specified Indemnitee") may have certain rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and/or insurance pursuant to charter documents,
constitutive agreements or other agreements with such Stockholder or
Affiliates of such Stockholder or other Person (other than the Company and
its Affiliates) of which such Specified Indemnitee is an officer, director,
partner, member, manager, employee, managing director or Affiliate
(collectively, the "Secondary Indemnitors"). In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Company hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

 

 

(d) The Company shall be the indemnitor of first resort for any claims or
proceedings (collectively, "Covered Claims") for which any Specified
Indemnitee is entitled, under the Charter or otherwise, to indemnification by
the Company (i.e., the Company's obligations to each such Specified
Indemnitee with respect to any Covered Claim are primary and any obligations
of any Secondary Indemnitor to advance expenses or to provide indemnification
for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by any such Specified
Indemnitee with respect Covered Claims are secondary).

 

 

(e) Subject to Sections 1 and 2 of Article IX of the Charter, the Company
shall pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by
any Specified Indemnitee in defending any Covered Claim in advance of such
Covered Claim's final disposition, without regard to any rights any such
Specified Indemnitee may have against any Secondary Indemnitor.

 

 

(f) The Company hereby irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases each
Secondary Indemnitor from any and all claims against such
Secondary Indemnitor for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery
of any kind in respect of any Covered Claim.

 

 

 The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by any Secondary
Indemnitor on behalf of any such Specified Indemnitee with respect to any
Covered Claim for which any such Specified Indemnitee has sought
indemnification from the Company shall affect the foregoing and any such
Secondary Indemnitor shall have a right of contribution and/or subrogation to
the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of
such Specified Indemnitee against the Company. Any amendment, repeal
or modification of this Section 4.16 shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a Specified Indemnitee or Secondary Indemnitor existing prior
to such repeal or modification.

 

 

  Rights and Obligations of Transferees. No Stockholder shall Transfer any
Equity Securities except in compliance with the Securities Act, the Charter
(as defined in the Merger Agreement), any applicable state or foreign
securities Laws and this Agreement, or if such Transfer would violate the
Communications Act or FCC Regulations and such Stockholder has been so
advised by the Company. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
such Transfer shall be made or recognized in the books and records of the
Company if such Transfer would result in a violation of the Communications
Act or FCC Regulations. Any Transfers in violation of this Agreement shall be
null and void.

 CLOSING SHARES REGISTRATION STATEMENT; Demand and Piggyback Rights

 

 

Section 6.1 Closing Shares Registration Statement. The Company shall prepare
the Closing Shares Registration Statement and file it with the SEC, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing Shares
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC no later than
120 days from the date hereof. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Closing Shares Registration Statement to remain effective
(subject to Section 2.6(c)) until the earlier to occur of (i) the date on
which all Registrable Securities included within the Closing Shares
Registration Statement have been sold (other than to a Permitted Transferee
to whom registration rights are effectively assigned in accordance with
Section 6.1 hereof) or (ii) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date that the
Closing Shares Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (the
end of such period, the "Closing Shares Shelf Expiration"). The Stockholders
who hold Registrable Securities each shall be entitled, at any time and
from time to time when the Closing Shares Registration Statement
is effective, to sell such Registrable Securities pursuant to such Closing
Shares Registration Statement (a "Shelf Takedown"). The resale of shares of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Closing Shares Registration Statement
may from time to time from and after the date the Closing Shares Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC and until the Closing Shelf
Expiration, upon the written request of any Stockholder that holds, together
with its Affiliates, at least a simple majority of the
Registrable Securities issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement to such Stockholder and its Affiliates and included
under the Closing Shares Registration Statement, be an underwritten offering;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to effect an
underwritten Shelf Takedown unless the gross proceeds from the sale of
Registrable Securities in such offering are reasonably expected to be at
least $10,000,000 (without regard to any underwriting discount or
commission); and provided, further, that the Company shall not be required
to effect more than one (1) underwritten Shelf Takedown in any 90-day period
or more than three (3) underwritten Shelf Takedowns in any 365-day period. In
the event that any Stockholder requests an underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to this Section 2.1 (the "Requesting Stockholder"), then
the other Stockholders, if any, in each of such Stockholder's discretion,
shall have the right to participate in such underwritten Shelf Takedown of
Registrable Securities registered under the Closing Shares Registration
Statement, subject to this Section 2.1, and (ii) the Company shall promptly
notify each of the Stockholders (other than the Requesting Stockholder) of
such underwritten Shelf Takedown, and such Stockholders shall have five (5)
Business Days after receipt of such notice to request, by written notice to
the Company and the Requesting Stockholder, that Registrable Securities held
by such Stockholder and registered pursuant to the Closing Shares
Registration Statement be sold pursuant to such proposed underwritten Shelf
Takedown. The Company and the Stockholders shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cooperate in taking any customary actions necessary or
appropriate, including making necessary filings with the SEC, to permit any
such Stockholder to participate in such proposed underwritten Shelf Takedown
in such circumstances. If the Closing Shares Registration Statement ceases to
be effective for any reason at any time prior to the Closing Shares Shelf
Expiration, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in
any event shall within 45 days of such cessation of effectiveness amend the
Closing Shares Registration Statement in a manner to obtain the
withdrawal of the order suspending the effectiveness thereof. In
any underwritten Shelf Takedown, the majority of the Stockholders requesting
such underwritten Shelf Takedown shall have the right to select the plan of
distribution, to select one counsel for the selling Stockholders and to
designate the lead managing underwriter in connection with any underwritten
Shelf Takedown pursuant to such registration and each other managing
underwriter for any such underwritten Shelf Takedown; provided, that in each
case, each such underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the managing
underwriters advise the Requesting Stockholder and the Company that, in their
opinion, the number of shares of Common Stock requested to be included in
such underwritten Shelf Takedown exceeds the amount that can be sold in such
underwritten Shelf Takedown without adversely affecting the distribution
(including the timing and/or price at which the Registrable Securities can
be sold) of the shares of Company Common Stock being offered,
such underwritten offering will include only the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that the underwriters advise can be sold in such underwritten
offering without having an adverse effect on the distribution (including the
timing and/or price at which the Registrable Securities can be sold) of the
shares of Company Common Stock being offered. The Company will include in
such underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant to the Closing Shares
Registration Statement, to the extent of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock which the Requesting Stockholder and the Company are so advised
can be sold in such underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Registrable Securities
of the Stockholders, pro rata, on the basis of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock requested to be included by such Stockholders.

 

 

 

 

 

C-5

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.2 Demand Registration Rights. As of and after the Closing Shares
Shelf Expiration, each Stockholder shall have the right to require the
Company to file one or more registration statements under the Securities Act
covering all or any part of its and its Affiliates' Registrable Securities
(a "Demand Registration") by delivering a written request (the "Demand
Registration Request") therefor to the Company specifying the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration and the intended
method of distribution thereof (each such Stockholder so requesting a Demand
Registration, an "Initiating Stockholder"). Any Demand Registration Request
may request that the Company register Registrable Securities on
an appropriate form, including a long-form registration statement on Form
S-1 (or any similar long-form registration statement), a shelf registration
statement, and, if the Company is a WKSI, an automatic shelf registration
statement; provided, however, that the Company shall only be obligated to
register such Registrable Securities if the sale of the Registrable
Securities requested to be registered by such Stockholder is reasonably
expected to result in aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least $20,000,000
(without regard to any underwriting discount or commission); and provided,
further, that unless otherwise approved by the Board, the Company shall not
be obligated to file a Registration Statement relating to any registration
request under this Section 2.2 within a period of 180 days after the
effective date of any other Registration Statement. The Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (subject to Section 2.6(c)), use
its reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC (no later than forty five
(45) days from the Company's receipt of the applicable Demand Request) and
cause to be declared effective such registration under the Securities Act of
the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to
register, for distribution in accordance with such intended method
of distribution, including a distribution to, and resale by, the members or
partners of the Initial Stockholder (a "Partner Distribution"), and (y) if
requested by the Stockholders, obtain acceleration of the effective date of
the registration statement relating to such registration. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause any Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2.2 (subject to Section 2.6(c) hereof) to remain
effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which all Registrable
Securities included within such Registration Statement have been sold (other
than to a Permitted Transferee to whom registration rights are effectively
assigned in accordance with Section 6.1 hereof) and (ii) the expiration of
180 days (or, if such registration is a shelf-registration statement that
permits sales of Registrable Securities on a delayed or continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, one (1) year) from the
date such Registration Statement first becomes effective (exclusive of any
period during which the holders of Registrable Securities are prohibited or
impaired from disposition of Registrable Securities by reason of the
occurrence of a Permitted Interruption), at which time the Company shall have
the right to deregister any of such securities that remain unsold. The
Company shall, at the request of any Stockholder (including to effect a
Partner Distribution), file any prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendments, or include in the initial Registration Statement
any disclosure or language, or include in any prospectus supplement or post-
effective amendment any disclosure or language, and otherwise take any
action, reasonably deemed necessary or advisable by such Stockholder
(including to effect a Partner Distribution). Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to effect
more than five (5) Demand Registrations pursuant to this Section 2.2.

 

 

Section 6.3 Piggyback Registration Rights. If the Company at any time
proposes to register any securities (whether pursuant to the exercise of
Demand Registration rights by a Stockholder of the Company or at the
initiative of the Company) under the Securities Act (other than the Closing
Shares Registration Statement solely as provided in Section 2.1) in
connection with a public offering of such securities for cash, whether for
its own account or for the account of other securityholders, and the form of
registration statement to be used may be used for the registration of
Registrable Securities held by the Stockholders, the Company shall give
prompt written notice of its intention to do to each Stockholder at least
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to filing any registration statement, and
the Stockholders ("Piggyback Stockholders"), may, by written notice to the
Company, request that any or all Registrable Securities not
otherwise registered pursuant to a Registration Statement (other than
the Closing Shares Registration Statement solely as provided in Section 2.1)
be included in such proposed registration of securities by the Company under
the Securities Act (a "Piggyback Registration"). Upon the written request of
any such Piggyback Stockholder, made within ten (10) Business Days following
the receipt of any such written notice (which request shall specify the
maximum number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such
Piggyback Stockholder and the intended method of distribution thereof),
the Company shall, subject to this Section 2.3, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities, the Piggyback Stockholders
of which have so requested the registration thereof, to be registered under
the Securities Act with the securities which the Company at the time proposes
to register to permit the sale or other disposition by the Piggyback
Stockholders (in accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof)
of the Registrable Securities to be so registered, including, if necessary,
by filing with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a supplement to the
registration statement filed by the Company or the prospectus related
thereto. There is no limitation on the number of such Piggyback Registrations
pursuant to the preceding sentence which the Company is obligated to effect.
No registration of Registrable Securities effected under this Section 2.3
shall relieve the Company of its obligations to effect Demand Registrations
under Section 2.2 hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

C-6

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 6.4 Additional Demand Registrations. If the Company effects the
registration of less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to
be included by the Initiating Stockholder in a Demand Registration under
Section 2.2, then the Stockholders shall be entitled to request an
additional Demand Registration with respect to such Registrable
Securities that were not so registered. If the Company withdraws or
suspends any Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.6(c) before
the expiration of such Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.2, and
before all of the Registrable Securities covered by such Demand Registration
have been sold pursuant thereto, the Initiating Stockholder shall
be entitled to request an additional Demand Registration with respect to
such Registrable Securities that were not so sold. Any such additional Demand
Registration shall be requested and effected in the manner and subject to the
procedures that applied with respect to the Demand Registration that was the
subject of the cutback in Section 3.4.

 

 

Section 6.5 Effective Registration Statement. A Demand Registration
pursuant to Section 2.2 shall not be deemed to have been effected unless (i)
a Registration Statement with respect thereto has become effective and, after
it has become effective, such Demand Registration is not interfered with by
any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or other
governmental agency or court for any reason, and (ii) the sale of Registrable
Securities contemplated thereby (if underwritten) has been consummated.

 

 

Section 6.6 Limitations on Demand and Piggyback Rights.

 

 

(a) With respect to any registrations requested pursuant to Section 2.2 or
Section 2.3, the Company may include in such registration any other equity
securities of the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Stockholders will not have piggyback or other registration
rights with respect to registered primary offerings by the Company (i)
covered by a Form S-8 Registration Statement (or a successor form) applicable
to employee benefit-related offers and sales, (ii) where the securities are
not being sold for cash, (iii) covered by a registration statement on Form
S-4 (or successor form) or (iv) relating to a corporate reorganization
pursuant to Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC.

 

 

(b) Any demand for the filing of a Registration Statement will be subject to
the constraints of any customary and reasonable lockup arrangements entered
into by the Company in connection with a then pending underwritten offering,
and such demand must be deferred until such lockup arrangements no longer
apply. If a demand has been made under this Article II, no further demands
may be made so long as the related offering is still being pursued in good
faith.

 

 

 

 

 

C-7

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The Company may postpone the filing of any Registration Statement or
suspend the effectiveness of any Registration Statement (including,
without limitation, the Closing Shares Registration Statement),
any amendment or post-effective amendment thereto or prospectus supplement
for a reasonable "blackout period" not in excess of 60 days if the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith that such registration,
offering, amendment or supplement (i) would materially interfere with a
bona fide business, financing or acquisition (including any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer or similar
transaction) transaction of the Company because it would be reasonably likely
to require premature disclosure of material, nonpublic information, the
premature disclosure of which the board of directors reasonably determines in
the exercise of its good faith judgment (and not for the avoidance of its
obligations under this Agreement) would not be in the best interests of the
Company, or (ii) could not be effected by the Company in compliance with the
applicable financial statement requirements under the Securities Act or
Exchange Act (such event described in this Section 2.6(c) during which
the Company is not required to make such filing, amendment or supplement is
herein referred to as a "Permitted Interruption"); provided, however, that
the Company shall not postpone the filing of a demanded
Registration Statement or suspend the effectiveness of any
Registration Statement pursuant to this Section 2.6 more than once in any
90-day period. If a Permitted Interruption affects a Registration Statement
during the period such Registration Statement remains effective, the Company
agrees to notify each of the Stockholders so affected by a Permitted
Interruption in writing as promptly as practicable upon each of the
commencement and the termination of each Permitted Interruption. The Company
shall not be required in such notice of a Permitted Interruption to
disclose the cause for such Permitted Interruption, and each
Stockholder agrees, subject to applicable law, that it will not
disclose receipt of such notice of Permitted Interruption to any
Person. Each Stockholder agrees that, upon receipt of any such notice
from the Company, such Stockholder will forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable Registration Statement
until the earlier of (i) such Stockholder's receipt of the Company's notice
as to the termination of the Permitted Interruption and (ii) 90 days
after receipt of the original notice of a Permitted Interruption. In
the event of a Permitted Interruption, the duration of the applicable period
in which a Registration Statement is to remain effective shall be extended by
the number of days of such period. The Company shall reimburse each holder of
Registrable Securities for all reasonable and documented out-of pocket costs
and expenses incurred by such Stockholder in connection with the postponement
or withdrawal of such a filing.

 

 

  ARTICLE VII

 

 

 Notices, Cutbacks and Other Matters

 

 

Section 7.1 Notifications Regarding Registration Statements. In order for
one or more Initiating Stockholders to exercise their right to demand that a
Registration Statement be filed, they must so notify the Company in writing
indicating the number of shares sought to be registered. The Company will
keep the Stockholders contemporaneously apprised of all pertinent aspects of
its pursuit of any registration, whether pursuant to a Demand Registration
or otherwise, with respect to which a Piggyback Registration opportunity is
available. Pending any required public disclosure and subject to applicable
legal requirements, the parties will maintain the confidentiality of these
discussions.

 

 

 

 

 

C-8

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 7.2 Notifications Regarding Registration Piggyback Rights. Subject
to Section 2.3, in the event that any sale of shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement is underwritten, the Company shall promptly notify
each Piggyback Stockholder of such development and the Piggyback
Stockholders shall have fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice
to request the registration by the Company under the Securities Act
of Registrable Securities not otherwise registered pursuant to
a Registration Statement (other than the Closing Shares
Registration Statement) in connection with such proposed registration
of securities.

 

 

Section 7.3 Plan of Distribution; Underwriters. In connection with any
Demand Registration, the majority of the Initiating Stockholders
participating in such Demand Registration shall have the right to select the
plan of distribution, to select one counsel for the selling Stockholders and
to designate the lead managing underwriter in connection with any
underwritten offering pursuant to such registration and each other managing
underwriter for any such underwritten offering; provided, that in each case,
each such underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

Section 7.4 Cutbacks. If the managing underwriters advise the Company and
the selling Stockholders that, in their opinion, the number of shares
requested to be included in an underwritten offering (other than any resale
of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Closing Shares Registration
Statement that is an underwritten offering, which shall be subject
to Section 2.1) exceeds the amount that can be sold in such offering
without adversely affecting the distribution (including the timing
and/or price at which the Registrable Securities can be sold) of the shares
being offered, such offering will include only the number of shares that the
underwriters advise can be sold in such offering without having an adverse
effect on the distribution (including the timing and/or price at which the
Registrable Securities can be sold) of the shares being offered. The Company
will include in such Registration Statement (other than any resale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Closing Shares Registration
Statement that is an underwritten offering, which shall be subject
to Section 2.1), to the extent of the number which the Company is so advised
can be sold in such offering, first, all securities proposed by the Company,
if any, to be sold for its own account; second, Registrable Securities
requested by the Stockholders to be included in such Registration Statement,
pro rata, on the basis of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
requested to be included in such Registration Statement.

 

 

Section 7.5 Withdrawals. Even if shares held by a Stockholder have been part
of a registered underwritten offering, such Stockholder may, no later than
the time at which the public offering price and underwriters' discount
are determined with the managing underwriter, decline to sell all or any
portion of the shares being offered for its account. In the event of such a
withdrawal, the Company and any Stockholder having the right to participate
in such offering may, in their discretion, include additional shares in such
offering in replacement of any shares so withdrawn without requiring any
further notice or piggyback registration rights with respect to the
Stockholder that has withdrawn its shares.

 

 

 

 

 

C-9

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 7.6 Lockups. In connection with any underwritten offering of
Registrable Securities, (a) the Company (and each of its executive
officers and directors) and (b) each Stockholder which is selling shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to its rights hereunder will agree to be bound
by the underwriting agreement's lockup restrictions (which must apply, and
continue to apply, in like manner to each of the Company (and each of its
executive officers and directors) and Stockholders participating in the
underwritten offering) that are agreed to (i) by the Company (if a majority
of the shares being sold in such underwritten offering are being sold for its
account) or (ii) by Stockholders holding a majority of shares being sold
by all Stockholders in such underwritten offering (if a majority of the
shares being sold in such underwritten offering are being sold by
Stockholders), as applicable.

 

 

Section 7.7 Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
Registration Statement or registered offering that includes shares held by
Stockholders, whether or not a Registration Statement becomes effective or
the offering is consummated, including all registration and filing fees,
printing expenses, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel (including
the fees and disbursements of one outside counsel for the Stockholders
(selected by the holders of the majority of the Registrable Securities to be
included in such Registration Statement) and of the independent certified
public accountants), and the expense of qualifying such shares under
state blue sky laws (all such expenses, the "Registration Expenses"), will
be borne by the Company. However, any underwriters', brokers' and dealers'
discounts and commissions, or similar fees of securities industry
professionals, and applicable transfer taxes, if any, in each case relating
to shares sold for the account of a Stockholder will be borne by such
Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company
shall not be required to pay fees and disbursements of any outside counsel
retained by any Stockholder or by any underwriter in connection with any
Registration Statement or registered offering, except as expressly set forth
above in this Section 3.7.

 

 

  ARTICLE VIII

 

 

 FACILITATING REGISTRATIONS AND OFFERINGS

 

 

Section 8.1 General. If the Company becomes obligated under this Agreement
to facilitate a registration and offering of shares on behalf of
Stockholders, the Company will do so with the same degree of care and
dispatch as would reasonably be expected in the case of a registration and
offering by the Company of shares for its own account. Without limiting this
general obligation, the Company will fulfill its specific obligations
as described in this Article IV.

 

 

Section 8.2 Registration Statements. In connection with each Registration
Statement (including the Closing Shares Registration Statement and any other
Registration Statement that is demanded by Stockholders or as to which
piggyback rights otherwise apply), the Company will:

 

 

 

 

 

C-10

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) (i) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement (or an
amendment or supplement to the Closing Shares Registration Statement)
covering the applicable shares, (ii) file amendments thereto as
warranted, (iii) seek the effectiveness thereof, and (iv) file with the
SEC prospectuses and prospectus supplements as may be required, all
in consultation with the Stockholders and as reasonably necessary in order
to permit the offer and sale of such shares in accordance with the applicable
plan of distribution;

 

 

(b) within a reasonable time prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement, any prospectus, any amendment to a Registration
Statement, amendment or supplement to a prospectus or any free
writing prospectus, provide copies of such documents to the
selling Stockholders and to the underwriter or underwriters of
an underwritten offering, if applicable, and to their respective counsel;
fairly consider such reasonable changes in any such documents prior to or

(d) notify each Stockholder promptly, and, if requested by such
Stockholder, confirm such advice in writing, (i) when a Registration
Statement has become effective and when any post-effective amendments
and supplements thereto become effective if such Registration Statement or
post-effective amendment is not automatically effective upon filing pursuant
to Rule 462 promulgated by the Securities Act, (ii) of the issuance by the
SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order, injunction or other
order or requirement suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement
or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) if, between the

of securities covered thereby pursuant to any agreement to which the Company
is a party, the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
such agreement cease to be true and correct in all material respects or if
the Company receives any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of the shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of
any proceeding for such purpose, and (iv) of the happening of any event

required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading;

 

 

(e) promptly furnish to counsel for each underwriter, if any, and for the
respective Stockholders copies of any correspondence with the SEC or any
state securities authority relating to the Registration Statement
or prospectus;

 

 

 

 

 

C-11

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including making available to its security holders an earnings
statement covering at least 12 months which shall satisfy the provisions

any similar provision then in force); and

 

 

(g) use all reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement at the earliest
possible time.

 

 

Section 8.3 Due Diligence. In connection with each registration and offering
of shares to be sold by Stockholders, the Company will, in accordance with
customary practice, make available for inspection by representatives of
the Stockholders and underwriters and any counsel or accountant retained by
such Stockholder or underwriters all relevant financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and cause
appropriate officers, managers and employees of the Company to supply all
information reasonably requested by any such representative, underwriter,
counsel or accountant in connection with their due diligence exercise.

 

 

Section 8.4 Information from Stockholders. Each Stockholder that holds
shares covered by any Registration Statement will furnish to the Company such
information regarding itself as is required to be included in the
Registration Statement, the ownership of shares by such Stockholder and the
proposed distribution by such Stockholder of such shares, and make
such customary representations to the Company, as the Company may from time
to time reasonably request in writing. Each Stockholder authorizes the
Company to include such information in the applicable Registration Statement
or other documents prepared or filed in connection therewith. Each
Stockholder further agrees to promptly notify the Company of any inaccuracies
or changes in the information provided to the Company that it becomes aware
of that may occur subsequent to the date hereof at any time while
a Registration Statement including shares owned by such Stockholder remains
effective. Each Stockholder agrees to distribute Registrable Securities
included in the Registration Statement only in the manner described in the
applicable Registration Statement.

 

 

Section 8.5 Additional Agreements of Stockholders.

 

 

(a) Each Stockholder agrees to, following such time that such Stockholder
becomes aware, as expeditiously as possible, notify the Company of the
occurrence of any event that makes any statement made in any
Registration Statement or any related prospectus regarding such
Stockholder untrue in any material respect or that requires the making of
any changes in either a Registration Statement or prospectus regarding such
Stockholder.

 

 

 

 

 

C-12

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each Stockholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 4.2(d)(ii)
or Section 4.2(d)(iv) hereof, such Stockholder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
until such Stockholder's receipt of the copies of any necessary supplements
or amendments to such Registration Statement or applicable prospectus, and,
if so directed by the Company, such Stockholder will deliver to the Company
all copies in its possession, other than permanent file copies then in
such Stockholder's possession, of the Registration Statement or applicable
prospectus covering such Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of
such notice. Each Stockholder agrees that in the event it receives any notice
from the Company under Section 4.2(d)(ii) or Section 4.2(d)(iv), it will not
disclose such fact to any person.

 

 

Section 8.6 Non-Closing Shares Registration Statements. In connection with
any non-shelf registered offering or shelf registration that is demanded by
Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.2 or as to which piggyback rights
apply pursuant to Section 2.3, the Company will:

 

 

(a) cooperate with the Stockholders selling shares and the sole underwriter
or managing underwriter of an underwritten offering shares, if any,
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing the shares to be sold and not bearing any
restrictive legends; and enable such shares to be in such
denominations (consistent with the provisions of the governing documents
thereof) and registered in such names as the selling Stockholders or
the sole underwriter or managing underwriter of an underwritten offering of
shares, if any, may reasonably request at least five (5) Business Days prior
to any sale of such shares;

 

 

(b) furnish to each Stockholder and to each underwriter, if any,
participating in the relevant offering, without charge, as many copies of the
applicable prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus, and
any amendment or supplement thereto and such other documents as
such Stockholder or underwriter may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the shares;
the Company hereby consents to the use of the prospectus, including each
preliminary prospectus, by each such Stockholder and underwriter in
connection with the offering and sale of the shares covered by the prospectus
or the preliminary prospectus;

 

 

(c) (i) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares being
offered and sold, no later than the time the applicable
registration statement becomes effective, under all applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as each underwriter, if
any, or any Stockholder holding shares covered by a registration statement,
shall reasonably request; (ii) use all reasonable efforts to keep each such
registration or qualification effective during the period such registration
statement is required to be kept effective; and (iii) do any and all other
acts and things which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
enable each such underwriter, if any, and Stockholder to consummate
the disposition in each such jurisdiction of such shares owned by
such Stockholder; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated
to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any
jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to consent to be subject to
general service of process (other than service of process in connection with
such registration or qualification or any sale of shares in connection
therewith) in any such jurisdiction;

 

 

(d) use all reasonable efforts to cause all shares being sold to be qualified
for inclusion in or listed on NASDAQ or any other U.S. securities exchange

requested by the Stockholders, or if so requested by the underwriter or
underwriters of an underwritten offering of shares, if any;

(g) enter into customary agreements (including, in the case of an

including provisions with respect to indemnification and contribution
in customary form and consistent with the provisions relating
to indemnification and contribution contained herein) and take all other
customary and appropriate actions in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such shares and in connection therewith:

 

 

(i) make such representations and warranties to the selling Stockholders and
the underwriters, if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily
made by issuers to underwriters in similar underwritten offerings;

 

 

(ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof
(which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the lead managing underwriter, if
any) addressed to each selling Stockholder and the underwriters, if
any, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in sales
of securities or underwritten offerings and such other matters as may be
reasonably requested by such Stockholders and underwriters;

 

 

(iii) obtain "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the Company's
independent certified public accountants addressed to the selling
Stockholders, if permissible, and the underwriters, if any, which letters
shall be customary in form and shall cover matters of the type customarily
covered in "cold comfort" letters to underwriters in connection with
primary underwritten offerings;

 

 

(iv) to the extent requested and customary for the relevant
transaction, enter into a securities sales agreement with the

 INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

Section 9.1 Indemnification by the Company. In the event of any registration
under the Securities Act by any Registration Statement, pursuant to rights
granted in this Agreement, of shares held by Stockholders, the Company will
hold harmless Stockholders, each director, officer, employee and Affiliate
of the Stockholders and each other person, if any, who controls any
Stockholder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each, a "Controlling
Person"), against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities
(including legal fees and costs of court), joint or several, to
which Stockholders or such Controlling Person may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or any actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
(a) contained, on its effective date, in any Registration Statement under
which such securities were registered under the Securities Act or any
amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing, or which arise out of or
are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or (b) contained in any preliminary prospectus, if used prior to
the effective date of such Registration Statement, or in the final prospectus
(as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have filed with the SEC
any amendment or supplement to the final prospectus), or which arise out of
or are based upon the omission or alleged omission (if so used) to state a
material fact required to be stated in such prospectus or necessary to make
the statements in such prospectus not misleading; and will reimburse
Stockholders and each such Controlling Person for any legal or any other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, or liability; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be liable to any Stockholder or Controlling Persons in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or
liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
such Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, solely
in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company
through a written instrument duly executed by such Stockholder specifically
for use in the preparation thereof. In connection with any underwritten
public offering effected under a Registration Statement, the Company will
agree to indemnify the underwriters on terms and conditions customary for
such an offering. This indemnity shall remain in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
an indemnified party, and shall survive the transfer (in accordance with the
terms hereof) of such Registrable Securities by the seller thereof.

 

 

Section 9.2 Indemnification by Stockholders. Each Stockholder will,
severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner
and to the same extent as set forth in Section 5.1) the Company,
each director, officer, employee and Affiliate of the Company and any Person
who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act with
respect to any statement or omission from such Registration Statement, or any
amendment or supplement to it, if such statement or omission was made solely
in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to the Company
through a written instrument duly executed by such Stockholder
specifically regarding such Stockholder for use in the preparation of
such Registration Statement or amendment or supplement; provided, however,
that such Stockholder shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
prior to the filing of any such Registration Statement amendment
or supplement, such Stockholder has furnished in writing to the Company
information expressly for use in such Registration Statement or prospectus or
any amendment or supplement which corrected or made not misleading
information previously furnished to the Company. This indemnity shall remain
in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Company, its directors, officers or controlling Persons, and
shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Securities by the
seller thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of any
such Stockholder shall not exceed an amount equal to the net
proceeds realized by such Stockholder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

C-15

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action involving a
claim referred to in the preceding Sections of this Article V, the
indemnified party will, if a resulting claim is to be made or may be
made against and indemnifying party, give written notice to the indemnifying
party of the commencement of the action. The failure of any indemnified party
to give notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations in
this Article V, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced by the failure to give notice. If any such action is brought
against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party will be entitled
to participate in and to assume the defense of the action with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and after
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election
to assume defense of the action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to
such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by the latter
in connection with the action's defense. An indemnified party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any action or proceeding and participate
in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
such indemnified party's expense unless (a) the employment of such counsel
has been specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party,
which authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld, (b) the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense and employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party within 60 days after notice of any such
action or proceeding, or (c) the named parties to any such action or
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have been advised
by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to
the indemnified party that are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying party (in which case the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
action or proceeding on behalf of the indemnified party), it
being understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not,
in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially similar
or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general
allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to all local counsel
which is necessary, in the good faith opinion of both counsel for the
indemnifying party and counsel for the indemnified party in order to
adequately represent the indemnified parties) for the indemnified party
and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred
upon written request and presentation of invoices. Whether or not a defense
is assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be
subject to any liability for any settlement made without its consent. No
indemnifying party will consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which (i) does not include as an unconditional term the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff, to the indemnified party, of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim or litigation or (ii) involves the
imposition of equitable remedies or the imposition of any non-financial
obligations on the indemnified party.

 

 

Section 9.4 Contribution. If the indemnification required by this Article V
from the indemnifying party is unavailable to or insufficient to hold
harmless an indemnified party in respect of any indemnifiable losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses, then the indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect (a) the relative benefit of the indemnifying and
indemnified parties and (b) if the allocation in clause (a) is not permitted
by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefit referred to in clause (a) and also the relative fault
of the indemnified and indemnifying parties, in connection with the actions
which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact, has been made
by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party
or parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount
paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damage,
liabilities, and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include any
legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The Company and Stockholders
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this Section 5.4 were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in the prior provisions of this Section
5.4. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.4, no indemnifying
or contributing party shall be required to contribute any amount in excess
of the amount by which the total price at which the securities were offered
to the public by such party exceeds the amount of any damages which such
party has otherwise been required to pay by reason of an untrue statement or
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such a fraudulent
misrepresentation.

Section 10.1 Transfer of Rights.

 

 

(a) This Agreement is personal to the parties hereto and not assignable or
transferable; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, a
Stockholder may assign and transfer its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to a Permitted Transferee in connection with a transfer or sale
of Registrable Securities to such Person, which assignment or transfer shall
only be effective upon receipt by the Company of a duly executed commitment
by such Permitted Transferee to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, in which case this Agreement shall be
assigned to, and may be enforced by, such Permitted Transferee, and such
Permitted Transferee shall thereupon have all of the rights and obligations
of its transferor hereunder.

 

 

(b) In the event the Company engages in a merger or consolidation in which
the Registrable Securities are converted into securities of another company,
and which securities are not tradable without registration under the
Securities Act, appropriate arrangements will be made so that the
registration rights provided under this Agreement continue to be provided to
Stockholders by the issuer of such securities. To the extent such new issuer,
or any other company acquired by the Company in a merger or consolidation,
was bound by registration rights obligations that would conflict with the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company will, unless the Required
Stockholders otherwise agree, use its best efforts to modify any
such "inherited" registration rights obligations so as not to interfere in
any material respects with the rights provided under this Agreement.

 

 

Section 10.2 Limited Liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither the members, general partners, limited partners or
managing directors, or any directors or officers of any members, general or
limited partner, advisory director, nor any future members,
general partners, limited partners, advisory directors, or
managing directors, if any, of any Stockholder shall have any
personal liability for performance of any obligation of such
Stockholder under this Agreement in excess of the respective
capital contributions of such members, general partners, limited
partners, advisory directors or managing directors to such Stockholder.

 

 

Section 10.3 Rule 144. If the Company is subject to the requirements of
Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company covenants that it
will file any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act (or, if the Company is subject to the requirements
of Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act but is not required to file
such reports, it will, upon the request of any Stockholder, make such
information available) and it will take such further action as any
Stockholder may reasonably request, so as to enable such Stockholder to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended from time to time, or (b)
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon
the request of any Stockholder, the Company will deliver to such Stockholder
a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

Section 10.4 In-Kind Distributions. If any Stockholder seeks to effectuate
an in-kind distribution of all or part of its Registrable Securities to its
direct or indirect equityholders, the Company will work with such Stockholder
and the Company's transfer agent to facilitate such in-kind distribution in
the manner reasonably requested by such Stockholder.

 

 

Section 10.5 No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered into,
and on or after the date of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement
that conflicts with the provisions hereof.

 Prior to the Closing, BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries will distribute
to the shareholders of BCHI the equity of an entity containing
certain assets associated with their consumer and single line
business services business as more fully described below, and will
enter into agreements and arrangements, containing, among others, terms set
forth below, each of which distributions, agreements and arrangements will be
preapproved by the Company. As used herein, on and after the Effective Time,
BCHI means the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 

 

 1.

 

Distribution. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, BCHI will distribute
to its shareholders all the equity interests in Spinco (as defined below)
(the "Distribution"). The time of the Distribution is herein referred to as
the "Distribution Time".

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 2.

 

Assets. Prior to the Distribution Time, BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries will
transfer to a newly created Subsidiary of BCHI or to Tempo Telecom, LLC
or another current subsidiary of BCHI approved by the Company (such company
being hereinafter referred to as "Spinco") (i) all customer contracts and
accounts relating thereto with respect to the then existing consumer business
of BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries and all customer contracts and accounts
relating thereto with respect to their single-line business services business
(collectively, the "Consumer/SMB Business Customers"), (ii) any assets that
are used solely to support the Consumer/SMB Business Customers, (iii)
any other assets that are reasonably agreed by the Parties as necessary to
support the services provided to the Consumer/SMB Business Customers, and
(iv) the patents set forth on Annex 1 to this Exhibit D and any
associated marks in the United States and Canada, which patents will
be licensed to the Surviving Company under a perpetual, royalty
free, worldwide license. The services currently provided by BCHI and
the BCHI Subsidiaries to the Consumer/SMB Business Customers
include landline local voice services, associated long distance
voice services, associated ancillary services such as adjunct-to-
basic services that are intended to facilitate completion of calls through
utilization of basic telephone service facilities including, but not limited
to, call waiting, speed dialing, caller ID, call blocking, call forwarding,
and voicemail, and associated carrier access services; the Tempo consumer
wireless voice and data services; and Canadian consumer landline local voice
services and related features (including, but not limited to, call
waiting, speed dialing, caller ID, call blocking, call forwarding,
and voicemail) associated long distance voice services (including, but not
limited to long distance calling plans, post-paid and prepaid calling cards),
and associated ancillary services (such as adjunct-to-basic services that are

service, local operator service, 4-1-1 directory assistance, 3-1-1 non-
Emergency municipal government services, 6-1-1 repairs, and 7-1-1 message
relay service) (collectively, the "Consumer/SMB Business").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 3.

 

Liabilities. The Parties agree that Spinco will, as of the Distribution Time,
have accounts receivable and accounts payable that have a net aggregate value
of $0. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to determine which accounts
receivable and accounts payable related to the Consumer/SMB Business will be
transferred to Spinco prior to the Distribution Time to achieve such net $0
aggregate value. No liabilities, other than those associated with the
accounts payable, will be assumed by Spinco other than accounts payable as
determined by this Section 3.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 4.

 

Employees. The Parties will cooperate in good faith to determine the
employees of BCHI and its Subsidiaries to be offered employment by Spinco in
connection with the Distribution.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

D-1

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.

 

Wholesale Agreement. The Company and BCHI will mutually develop the terms of
a wholesale agreement under the terms of which Spinco will purchase
specific services from the Surviving Company, these services will
include services currently purchased by BCHI and the BCHI Subsidiaries
from various third-party carriers and services available directly from the
Company and its Subsidiaries; the agreement will be structured in a manner
designed to enable the parties to maximize the benefit of any existing volume
discounts provided by third party carriers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 6.

 

Transition Services Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

(a) The Company and BCHI will negotiate the terms of a transition services
agreement, under which Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will
provide Spinco and its Subsidiaries with various agreed upon
support services that are reasonably required by Spinco to support
the Consumer/SMB Business Customers, for a period of up to three (3) years
following the Distribution Time. The cost of such services will be mutually
agreed upon by the Company and BCHI.

 

 

(b) If, prior to the Distribution Time, Spinco is unable to obtain all
required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits necessary for it
to legally operate the Consumer/SMB Business, Spinco and the
Surviving Company will enter into a management agreement, the terms of
which will be agreed by BCHI and the Company in advance of the Distribution
Time.

 

 

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Exhibit D cannot be
consummated on the terms set forth herein due to the failure to obtain
any required regulatory approvals or consents with respect to any material
contracts or arrangements, BCHI and the Company will work in good faith to
restructure these transactions in a manner that provides the parties with
substantially the same economic and commercial position as if such
transactions had occurred as set forth in this Exhibit D.

 

 

 

 

 7.

 

Valuation; Adjustments to Distribution.

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The value of the Consumer/SMB Business as of the Distribution Time will
be calculated as follows (the "Distribution Value"): (i) EBITDA of the
Consumer/SMB Business for the last full calendar month prior to the
Distribution Time; multiplied by (ii) 12; multiplied by (iii) $3.48. For
purposes of the foregoing, EBITDA of the Consumer/SMB Business will
be calculated in accordance with the methodology used in creating
the information included on Annex 2 to this Exhibit D. BCHI will
calculate the Distribution Value in good faith and provide the calculation
to the Company for its reasonable verification. If the Company and BCHI are
unable to reach agreement concerning the value of the Consumer/SMB Business,
the parties will submit the matter to an independent accounting firm for
their determination.

 

 

(c) If the Distribution Value is less than $25 million, then, immediately
prior to the Distribution Time, BCHI will deliver to Spinco a promissory
note payable to Spinco in an amount equal to the excess of $25 million over
the Distribution Value. This promissory note will be payable on the one-year
anniversary of the Closing Date and may be settled by Surviving Company, at
its election, either in cash or in shares of Company Common Stock, such
shares to be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in clause
(c) below.

 

 

(d) If the Distribution Value is greater than $25 million (the "Excess
Value"), then the BCHI shareholders will either (i) make a cash payment, at
the Distribution Time, to BCHI in an amount equal to the Excess Value, or
(ii) cause Spinco to issue a promissory note payable to BCHI in an amount
equal to the Excess Value, payable on the one-year anniversary of the Closing
Date, which at the election of Spinco can be paid in cash, or paid by the
transfer of a number of shares of the common stock of the Company equal to
(rounded up or down to the nearest whole share) (1) the Excess Value, divided
by (2) the greater of (A) $2.00, or (B) the weighted average daily
closing price of the Company Common Stock, as reported by NASDAQ (or
any successor to such exchange), for the ten (10) consecutive trading days
ending immediately prior to the third Business Day preceding the date of such
transfer.
