Section 2.10 _Adjustment to Base Purchase Price_. (a) Section 2.10 of the

liability line items and general ledger accounts that constitute the Working
Capital of the Business, the Working Capital of the Purchased Consolidated
Ventures, the Cash Amounts of the Purchased Consolidated Companies and the
Funded Debt of the Purchased Consolidated Companies (the " _Sample Post-
Closing Statement_ ").

(b) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Purchaser a closing statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good-faith estimate of (i) the
Closing Working Capital (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Working
Capital_ "), (ii) the Adjustment Amount (such estimate, the " _Estimated
Adjustment Amount_ "), (iii) the Closing Cash Amounts (such estimate, the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amounts_ ") and (iv) the Closing Funded Debt (such
estimate, the

 



-25-  " _Estimated Closing Funded Debt_ "). The Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies set forth on Section 2.10 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules (such principles, practices, methodologies and policies,
collectively, the " _Transaction Accounting Principles_ "). The Estimated
Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Estimated
Closing Cash Amount and the Estimated Closing Funded Debt shall be used to
calculate the Closing Purchase Price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the
Closing.

 

(c) As promptly as reasonably possible and in any event within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and will provide to Seller, a written statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ "), setting forth the Closing Working Capital, the Adjustment
Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt, and, in
each case, any difference from the estimates included in the Closing
Statement. The Post-Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
Purchasers calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with the
Sample Post-Closing Statement and shall be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles.

(d) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by Seller of the Post-
Closing Statement, Seller shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of any
dispute Seller has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content of
the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that if Seller does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Purchaser within such
forty-five (45) day period, the Post-Closing Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement that Seller
disputes and (ii) the correct amount of such item; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller may not dispute the accounting principles, practices,
methodologies and policies used in preparing the Post-Closing Statement unless
they are not in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles. Upon
receipt by Purchaser of a Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute set forth therein. If
Purchaser and Seller fail to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "),
then Purchaser and Seller jointly shall engage, within ten (10) Business Days
following the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, Deloitte LLP or, if
Deloitte LLP is unavailable or conflicted, another nationally recognized
independent accounting firm selected jointly by Seller and Purchaser (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any such dispute; _provided_ that,
if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on the Independent Accounting
Firm, then each of Seller and Purchaser shall select a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm, and the two (2) firms will mutually select a
third nationally recognized independent accounting firm to serve as the
Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not
more than fifteen (15) days following the engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall each prepare and submit a
presentation detailing each partys complete statement of proposed resolution
of each issue still in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm. Purchaser
and Seller shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon as
practicable after the submission of the presentations described in the
immediately preceding sentence and in any event not more than twenty (20) days
following such presentations, make a final determination, binding on the
parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items
that remain in dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice. With respect to
each disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the 

 



-26-  higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, in their respective presentations to the Independent
Accounting Firm described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of
the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
limited to whether any disputed determinations of the Closing Working Capital,
the Adjustment Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt
were properly calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Seller
and Purchaser. All determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm,
and the Post-Closing Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting
Firm, will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The parties agree
that any adjustment as determined pursuant to this Section 2.10(d) shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law.

 

(e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.10,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with each other in
good faith and make available to each other and their respective
Representatives all information, records, data and working papers, in each
case to the extent related to the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities,
Business, Purchased Entities or Purchased Consolidated Ventures, and shall
permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required
in connection with the preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement
and the resolution of any disputes thereunder.

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Base Purchase Price, _plus_
(i) the Closing Cash Amounts, _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (which may be
a positive or negative number), _minus_ (iii) the Closing Funded Debt, in the
case of each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, as finally determined
pursuant to Sections 2.10(c) and 2.10(d).

(g) If the Closing Purchase Price shall exceed the Final Purchase Price, then
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess
to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller; or if the Final
Purchase Price shall exceed the Closing Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall
pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to Seller by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to be made
within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the Adjustment Amount,
Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Funded Debt are finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.10.

 

Section 2.11 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Purchaser agree to
allocate and, as applicable, to cause their relevant Affiliates to allocate,
the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.10) and any
other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
among the Purchased Assets (including among the Purchased Entity Shares and
the Purchased Venture Interests) and the Non-Competition Obligations in
accordance with the " _Allocation_ ", as determined pursuant to this Section
2.11. No later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price and any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes as of the
Closing Date determined in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Seller s
Allocation_"). If Purchaser disagrees with the Sellers Allocation, Purchaser
may, by the later of (i) thirty (30) days after delivery of the Sellers

 



-27-  Allocation or (ii) sixty (60) days after the date hereof, deliver a notice
(the " _Purchaser s Allocation Notice_") to Seller to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Purchaser disagrees and setting forth Purchasers
proposed allocation. If the Purchasers Allocation Notice is duly delivered,
Seller and Purchaser shall, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, but in no event any later than thirty (30) days before the Closing
Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price
and any other items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax
Purposes. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement by the
date which is thirty (30) days before the Closing Date, they shall promptly
thereafter cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any remaining
disputes. Any allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes determined pursuant to
the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall not take into account
the Purchasers acquisition structure, any post-Closing restructuring by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or any other post-Closing transfers by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates affecting the economic value of any portion
of the Business (including transfers of assets, functions or risks). The
allocation, as prepared by Seller if no Purchasers Allocation Notice has been
timely given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between Seller and
Purchaser or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. None of Seller or Purchaser shall (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) take any position
inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding,
in each case, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign law). Any amounts treated as an
adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes pursuant to Section 6.9
after the Closing shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets to which they
relate.

Section 2.12 _Non-Assignment; Consents_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in Section 2.12(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to sell, assign, transfer or convey any Purchased Asset if an attempted sale,
assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof would be prohibited by Law or
would, without the approval, authorization or consent of, filing with,
notification to, or granting or issuance of any license, order, waiver or
permit by, any Person (collectively, " _Approvals_ "), (i) constitute a
breach or other contravention thereof or (ii) be ineffective, void or
voidable.

 

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
or cause to be obtained, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which
shall be governed by Section 5.1) required to sell, assign or transfer any
Purchased Asset. If such Approval is not obtained prior to Closing, until the
earlier of such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and two (2)
years following the Closing Date, then Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in
any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller intended to both
(x) provide Purchaser, or Affiliates of Purchaser designated by Purchaser,
to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits of any
such Purchased Assets (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing
or subleasing arrangement) and (y) cause Purchaser, or such designated
Affiliates of Purchaser, to bear all costs and Liabilities thereunder to the
extent an Assumed Liability from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement to the extent that Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of
Purchaser, receives the rights and benefits 

 



-28-  of such Purchased Assets from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser will, or will cause its
applicable Affiliates to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any
related Liability to the extent an Assumed Liability (including any liability
for Taxes, as determined in accordance with Section 2.12(d)) arising
thereunder after the Closing Date to the extent that Purchaser, or such
designated Affiliates of Purchaser, receives the rights and benefits of such
Purchased Assets from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(c) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with
Section 2.4(b) that does not exclusively relate to the Business (each, a "
_Shared Contract_ ") shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that relate to the
Business, to either Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser designated by
Purchaser, if so assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately
amended prior to, on or after the Closing, so that Purchaser, or such
designated Affiliate of Purchaser, shall be entitled to the rights and benefit
of those parts of the Shared Contract that relate to the Business and shall
assume the portion of the Liabilities that relate to the Business under such
Shared Contracts to the extent as Assumed Liability (such portion of such
Liabilities, the " _Purchaser Portion of the Shared Contract Liabilities_ "
and the remainder of such Liabilities under such Shared Contract, the "
_Seller Portion of the Shared Contract Liabilities_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) in no event shall any Person be required to assign (or amend),
either in its entirety or in part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable
(or cannot be amended) by its terms without obtaining one or more Approvals
and (ii) if any Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms
or otherwise, or cannot be amended, without such Approval or Approvals, until
the earlier of such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained and two
(2) years following the Closing Date, then Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser to establish an agency type or other similar arrangement reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser intended to both (x) provide Purchaser,
or Affiliates of Purchaser designated by Purchaser, to the fullest extent
practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of
those parts that relate to the Business (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y)
cause Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of Purchaser, to bear the
costs and Liabilities thereunder to the extent an Assumed Liability from and
after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement to the extent that
Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of Purchaser, receives the rights
and benefits of the parts of the Shared Contracts that relate to the Business.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser will, or will cause its applicable
Affiliates to, promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any Liability to
the extent an Assumed Liability (including any liability for Taxes, as
determined in accordance with Section 2.12(d)) arising thereunder after the
Closing Date to the extent that Purchaser, or such designated Affiliates of
Purchaser, receives the rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared
Contracts that relate to the Business.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Tax Laws (and to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.12(b) or 2.12(c)), Seller and Purchaser agree to treat
and report, and to cause their respective applicable Affiliates to treat and
report, on their Tax Returns, the Purchased Assets that are subject to the
provisions of this Section 2.12 (the " _Non-Transferred Assets_ ") as assets
owned by the Purchaser or its Affiliates. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees
to notify the other party promptly in writing if it determines that such
treatment (to the extent consistent with the relevant

 



-29-  arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.12(b) or
2.12(c)) is not permitted under applicable Tax Laws. Where such treatment is
not permitted under applicable Tax Laws, and subject to the terms of any
relevant arrangement agreed to by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.12(b) or 2.12(c), the amount of the Liability for Taxes imposed on Seller or
any of its Affiliates with respect to any Non-Transferred Asset for any Post-
Closing Period shall be calculated on a "with and without" basis, and
Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates shall pay, be responsible for and
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any
such Tax Liability. Seller shall provide, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates to provide, Purchaser with a reasonable opportunity to review the
relevant portion of any applicable Tax Returns relating to any Non-
Transferred Assets for any Post-Closing Period (and accompanying schedules,
calculations and other reasonably requested work papers) as necessary for
determining such Tax Liability; _provided_ , that, in the case of Tax Returns
of Seller, any Seller Entity or any of their respective Affiliates (or of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or Tax group including any of them), Seller
may, in lieu of delivering the Tax Returns, deliver to Purchaser pro-forma
statements setting forth in sufficient detail the information relevant for
determining the relevant Tax Liability. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to
reach an agreement in respect of any dispute concerning such Tax Liability,
they shall promptly submit any such dispute for resolution to the Independent
Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.

 

Section 2.13 _Tax Withholding_. Subject to the below provisions of this
Section 2.13, Seller, Purchaser and each of their respective Affiliates shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under
this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to such payment under any applicable Tax Law. In the event that
Purchaser reasonably determines that any portion of the Purchase Price is or
would reasonably be expected to be subject to withholding under applicable Tax
Law (other than Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such
determination in writing, but in no event less than thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date. During the ten (10) day period following the delivery of
such notice, if any, Seller shall review such notice and shall advise
Purchaser in writing of any disagreement. Seller and Purchaser shall endeavor
in good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If Seller and Purchaser cannot
resolve any such disagreement within (10) days following the delivery of
Sellers notice of disagreement, Seller shall have the opportunity to deliver
to Purchaser a written opinion of a nationally recognized tax counsel or
adviser in the relevant jurisdiction upon which Purchaser or an applicable
Affiliate of Purchaser may rely under applicable Law, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, to the effect that, at a "more likely
than not" confidence level (or such higher confidence level as may be
required to avoid the imposition of penalties on a taxpayer in the relevant
jurisdiction), no such proposed withholding is required. If such opinion is
delivered to the Purchaser at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date,
none of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall deduct or withhold any
amounts from such portion of the Purchase Price (other than any amounts
required to be deducted or withheld under Section 1445 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to a payment to a
Seller Entity that fails to comply with its obligations under Section
2.8(b)(vi)). To the extent that amounts are deducted, withheld and remitted to
the appropriate Taxing Authority in compliance with the above provisions of
this Section 2.13, such deducted, withheld and remitted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the relevant
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Each of
the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate the
imposition of any withholding Taxes.

 



-30- Section 2.14 _Foreign Acquisition Agreements_. The transfer of any Purchased
Assets or Purchased Company organized in a jurisdiction in which local Laws
require observance of specified formalities or procedures to legally effect a
transfer of such Purchased Assets or Purchased Company will be effected
pursuant to short-form acquisition agreements (the " _Foreign Acquisition
Agreements_ ") on a country-by-country basis. Each Foreign Acquisition
Agreement for the transfer of Purchased Assets shall be in substantially the
same form as the form of Foreign Acquisition Agreement attached as _Exhibit
D_ hereto, and each Foreign Acquisition Agreement for the transfer of a
Purchased Company shall be in substantially the same form as the form of
Foreign Acquisition Agreement attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto,1 except, in
each case, as Seller and Purchaser may otherwise agree, including for: (i) the
deletion of provisions which are inapplicable to such Purchased Assets or
Purchased Company; (ii) such changes as may be necessary to satisfy the
requirements of applicable local Law; and (iii) such changes as may be
reasonably agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser regarding employees and
employee benefit matters in order to adapt such agreement to the particular
circumstances of the relevant Purchased Assets or Purchased Company, as
applicable, and country; _provided_ , in each case that the Foreign
Acquisition Agreements shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the
applicable Purchased Assets or Purchased Company and shall not have any
significant effect on the value being received by Purchaser or its Affiliates
or transferred by the Seller Entities, including the allocation of assets
and Liabilities as between them, all of which shall be determined by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ that the Foreign Acquisition Agreements for
the transfer of Purchased Assets located in Japan, Korea, France, Macedonia
and Tunisia shall be substantially in all material respects in the forms
attached as _Exhibits D-1_ and _D-2_ , _D-3_ , _E-1_ , _E-2_ and _E-3_ hereto,
respectively.

 

Section 2.15 _French Assets; French Interests_. (a) The parties acknowledge
that, under French labor laws, one or several of the works councils of the
French Entities will need to be informed and consulted (such councils, the "
_Works  Councils_" and such process of informing and consulting, the "
_Consultation Process_ ") with respect to the offer made by Purchaser to
acquire any Purchased Assets located in France or the share capital or other
equity interests of any Purchased Entity or any Purchased Venture that owns or
controls any Purchased Assets located in France (collectively, the " _French
Assets_ ," such share capital or other equity interests, collectively, the "
_French Interests_ ," such Purchased Entities, the " _French Entities_ ," and
such Purchased Ventures, the " _French Ventures_ ") with the view to
completing the Consultation Process with respect to each Works Council by way
of one of the following (any of the events in clause (i) through (iv) having
occurred, the " _Completion of the Consultation Process_ "): (i) an opinion
issued by such Works Council and confirmed in writing; (ii) if the minutes of
the meeting during which an opinion described in clause (i) was issued
has not been approved by the members of such Works Council within five (5)
Business Days from the date of such meeting, a written statement of the
president of such Works Council confirming that the opinion was issued; (iii)
the expiration of the maximum period available under applicable Law for such



   1  |

NTD: If a form is able to be agreed with respect to a particular country prior
to signing, that form will be attached to the agreement in lieu of general
forms. 

---|--- 
 



-31-  Works Council to issue its opinion, if applicable; or (iv) a decision of
the relevant Governmental Entity that the Consultation Process has been
completed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, unless and until Seller has executed and delivered to Purchaser the
Acceptance Notice, (x) the provisions of this Article II shall not be
effective with respect to the French Assets and the French Interests (
_provided_ that the other provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply
to the French Assets and the French Interests), (y) for the purpose of this
Article II (and only this Article II) the French Assets and the
French Interests shall not be considered Purchased Assets, the French
Entities shall not be considered Purchased Entities and the French Ventures
shall not be considered Purchased Ventures, and (z) the Purchase Price shall
be reduced by the French Purchase Price.

(b) On the terms and conditions set forth in the offer letter attached as
_Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _French Offer Letter_ " and the offer set forth
therein, the " _French Offer_ "), including the price specified therein (the "
_French Purchase Price_ "), Purchaser has irrevocably offered to acquire, or
to cause its applicable Affiliates to acquire, the French Assets and the
French Interests (within the time limit set forth therein) and to have the
provisions of this Article II apply to such French Assets and such French
Interests following Completion of the Consultation Process. Subject to
acceptance of the French Offer by Seller following Completion of the
Consultation Process, and upon delivery to Purchaser of the executed
Acceptance Notice attached as Schedule III to the French Offer Letter (the "
_Acceptance Notice_ "), this Article II shall be effective with respect to the
French Assets and the French Interests, the French Assets and the French
Interests shall be included in the Purchased Assets, the French Entities shall
be included in the Purchased Entities and the French Ventures shall be
included in the Purchased Ventures, and the Purchase Price shall no longer be
reduced by the French Purchase Price (it being understood that the Purchase
Price assumes delivery of the Acceptance Notice and therefore already
includes the French Purchase Price).

(c) From and after the date Seller receives the French Offer Letter, Seller
shall use reasonable best efforts to convene the Works Councils to a meeting
or meetings and to diligently carry out the Consultation Process in compliance
with applicable Law. Seller shall keep Purchaser apprised of the status of
the Consultation Process and provide Purchaser with copies of any relevant
document or materials prepared for the attention of, or issued by, the Works
Councils in connection with the Consultation Process, including copies of
the minutes of the meetings where the Works Councils opinions are
delivered. If, as a result of statements made by the Works Councils in
connection with the Consultation Process, changes to the Transaction
Documents, or further arrangements in connection with the Transaction, are
considered necessary, Seller shall, after consultation with Purchaser,
negotiate in good faith on such changes (if any) to the Transaction Documents
or further arrangements (if any) in connection with the Transaction that are
appropriate. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and its relevant
French Affiliates in connection with the Consultation Process (but shall be
under no obligation to agree to any amendments to the French Offer Letter or
any amendments to any Transaction Document or to offer any concessions).

Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by
Seller with the terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, require the Approval of any Person (other than any Governmental
Entity) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to a loss of benefit under, or result in the

Purchaser. Purchaser has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Seller, this Agreement

being provided to it in connection with the Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of that certain
confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, on

Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference in
their entirety and shall, subject to the following sentence, survive the
Closing; _provided_ , that actions taken by the parties hereunder to the
extent necessary in order to comply with their respective obligations under
Section 5.1 hereunder shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Section
5.3 or the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not affect Section 5.1(b) to the extent that Section
5.1(b) specifies that it is subject to this Section 5.3 or the Confidentiality
Agreement. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the
Business or the Purchased Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser
acknowledges that its obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure with
respect to any and all other information provided to it by

 



-58-  or on behalf of Seller, the other Seller Entities, the Purchased Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, concerning Seller, the
other Seller Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (other than

confidential or proprietary information included in the Purchased Assets ("
_Confidential Business Information_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
term "Confidential Business Information" will not include any information (i)
that becomes available to Seller or its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing, from a third party source that is
not known by Seller to be under any obligations of confidentiality in respect
of such information, (ii) that is or becomes generally available to, or known
by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof) or
(iii) that is or was derived independently by Seller, its Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives without use of Confidential Business
Information. In addition, the foregoing shall not prohibit Seller,
its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives (A) from using
Confidential Business Information for the purpose of complying with the terms
of any of the Transaction Documents or any Contract that has not been assigned
or transferred pursuant to Section 2.12, or (B) disclosing Confidential
Business Information that Seller, any of its Affiliates or its or their
Representatives are required by Law (by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose ( _provided_ that Seller will, to the extent not legally
prohibited, provide Purchaser with prompt written notice of such request so

individuals.

Section 5.4 _Access to Information_. (a) Seller shall afford to Purchaser and
its Representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal

and its Subsidiaries related to the Business, the Purchased Assets and the

 



-59-  Purchased Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) neither Seller nor any

the Purchased Companies or any of their respective Affiliates.

(b) Purchaser agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the access
granted under Section 5.4(a) shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the Business, and none of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall communicate with
any of the employees of the Business without the prior written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information where, upon the advice of counsel, such access or
disclosure would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws.

 

(c) At and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, afford Seller, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives,

books, Contracts, records and employees of the Business and the Purchased
Entities to the extent that such access may be reasonably requested by Seller,
including in connection with financial statements, taxes, reporting
obligations and compliance with applicable Laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit any of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates rights of discovery.

 

(d) Purchaser agrees to hold all the books and records of the Business
existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of any thereof for
a period of ten (10) years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be

dispose of such books and records, to offer first in writing at least
sixty (60) days prior to such destruction or disposition to surrender them to
Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.4, while the existence
of an adversarial proceeding between the parties will not abrogate or suspend
the provisions of this Section 5.4, as to such records or other information
directly pertinent to such dispute, the parties may not utilize this Section
5.4 but rather, absent agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.

Section 5.5 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
Transaction shall be a joint press release and has been agreed upon by Seller
and Purchaser. Other than such joint press release, from the date of this

be settled or otherwise eliminated in such a manner as Seller shall determine
in its sole discretion (including by the Seller Entities or any of their
Affiliates removing from any Purchased Consolidated Company all Cash Amounts
or funds from cash pools by means of dividends, distributions, contributions,
the creation or repayment of intercompany debt, increasing or decreasing of
cash pool balances or otherwise). Intercompany balances and accounts solely
among any of the Purchased Companies shall not be affected by this provision.

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_. (a) _Continuation of Employment_. As of the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall (i) cause each of the
Purchased Consolidated Ventures, the Purchased Entities and their respective
Subsidiaries to continue to employ on the applicable Employee Transfer Date
its respective Current Purchased Company Employees, and (ii) with respect to
each other Current Business Employee, either (A) continue to employ such other
Current Business Employee, to the extent employment continues by operation of
Law, or (B) offer, or cause its applicable Affiliate to offer, employment to
such other Current Business Employee (subject to Section 5.7(f), exclusive of
any such individual who is receiving short- or long-term disability benefits
as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date), to the extent employment does
not continue by operation of Law, in all cases, on terms consistent with this
Section 5.7. Each Current Purchased Company Employee, each other Current

any such Delayed Transfer Employee), each Current Business Employee who
accepts Purchasers offer of employment pursuant to this Section 5.7(a) and
actually commences employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, and each
Current Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser in
accordance with Section 5.7(f) and actually commences employment with

months following the applicable Employee Transfer Date, (i) the same base wage
rate or base salary level in effect for such Transferred Business Employee
immediately prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date,

 



-61-  (ii) incentive compensation opportunities for such Transferred Business
Employee that are no less favorable than those applicable to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (iii) employee
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates. The compensation
and benefits of Transferred Business Employees who are covered by a
collective bargaining or other labor Contract shall be provided in accordance
with the applicable Contract. As of and after the applicable Employee Transfer
Date, Purchaser shall provide to each Transferred Business Employee full
credit for all purposes under any Purchased Entity Benefit Plan and under
each other employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement maintained by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, in each case for such Transferred Business
Employees service prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date with Seller
or any of its Affiliates to the same extent such service is recognized for

purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan.

(c) _Health Coverages_. Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Business

Transferred Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation already
in effect under the applicable group health Benefit Plan covering such
individual immediately prior to such Employee Transfer Date) or (B) any other
exclusion or waiting period not in effect under the applicable group
health Benefit Plan immediately before such Employee Transfer Date; and (ii)
provide each such Transferred Business Employee full credit under Purchasers
or such Affiliates group health plans, for the plan year in which the
applicable Employee Transfer Date occurs, for any deductible, co-payment or

or dependent under the applicable group health Benefit Plan for the plan year
in which the applicable Employee Transfer Date occurs.

(d) _Severance_. Subject to Purchasers compliance with its obligations under
this Section 5.7 in respect of terms of offers to, and terms of continued
employment (and employment following the applicable Employee Transfer Date)
of, respective Current International Business Employees, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain any Liability in respect of, and indemnify Purchaser
and its Affiliates for, any severance benefits payable to the Current
International Business Employee (other than any Current International Business
Employee located in Shanghai, China) that arises as a result of the
termination of such employees employment with Seller and its Affiliates and
the transfer of the employment of such employee to Purchaser or its Affiliates
(it being understood that Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates for any such Liabilities arising in respect of a Current
International Business Employee with respect to whom Purchaser has not
complied with its obligations referenced in this sentence). Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall assume (i) any Liability in respect of severance benefits
payable to any Current International Business Employee located in Shanghai,

Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (including the other
Seller Entities) and their respective Affiliates for all such severance
benefits. Without limiting Section 5.7(b) or Section 5.7(j), with respect to
each Transferred Business Employee whose employment is terminated by
Purchaser or its Affiliates without Cause during the period commencing on the
applicable Employee Transfer Date and ending twelve (12) months after such
Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, provide such Transferred Business Employee with severance benefits equal
in value to the greater of (A) those that such Transferred Business Employee
would receive under the applicable severance policy, program or arrangement of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, and (B) the severance benefits determined in
accordance with the policy set forth on Section 5.7(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, in each case, taking into account such Transferred
Business Employees service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the
applicable Employee Transfer Date and with Purchaser and its Affiliates on and
after the applicable Employee Transfer Date.

 

(e) _Accrued Vacation, Sick Leave and Personal Time_. Purchaser shall
recognize and assume all Liabilities with respect to accrued but unused
vacation, sick leave and personal time for all Transferred Business Employees
(including any Liabilities to Transferred Business Employees in respect of
earned but unused vacation time that arise as a result of the transfer of
employment contemplated by this Section 5.7) to the extent not required to be
cashed out by applicable Law. Seller shall promptly (and, in any event, within
ten (10) Business Days following the applicable Employee Transfer Date) notify
Purchaser of the amount of accrued but unused vacation time credited to each
Transferred Business Employee as of the Closing.

(f) _Disability Benefits_. If any Current Purchased Company Employee who does
not become or remain an employee of Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the
applicable Employee Transfer Date by operation of applicable Law and who is
receiving short- or long-term disability benefits as of such Employee
Transfer Date is, within six (6) months following such Employee Transfer Date,
able to return to work, Purchaser shall offer employment to such employee on
terms consistent with those applicable to Transferred Business Employees
generally under this Section 5.7. Purchaser shall return to work any inactive
employee of the Business who is subject to a collective bargaining or other
labor Contract assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates and who is receiving short-
or long-term disability benefits as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date,
but who subsequently becomes able to return to work within the period provided

(g) _401(k) Plan_. Effective as of the applicable Employee Transfer Date,
Purchaser shall establish participation by the Transferred Business Employees

Transferred Business Employee who, as of immediately prior to such Employee
Transfer Date, was eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Seller 401(k) Plans_ "). As soon as practicable after the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, Seller shall cause the Seller 401(k)
Plans, to the extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, to make
distributions available to Transferred Business Employees, and for not less
than six (6) months following the applicable Employee Transfer Date, the
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept any such
distribution (excluding loans) as a rollover contribution if so directed by
the Transferred Business Employee.

 



-63- (h) _Annual Bonuses_. Seller or its applicable Affiliate shall pay an annual
bonus for the year in which the applicable Employee Transfer Date occurs
prorated through such Employee Transfer Date (which will be based upon actual
performance determinations made by Seller, unless such determinations have not
been made as of the time of payment, in which case the amount will be based
upon the applicable target level) to each Transferred Business Employee who is
or would be eligible to receive an annual bonus under any Benefit Plan
pursuant to the terms thereof.

 

(i) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Exclusive of the Purchased Non-
Consolidated Ventures, Purchaser agrees that, as of and following the

labor Contracts as the representatives of the Transferred Business Employees
of the bargaining units described therein, in each case, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the applicable collective bargaining or other
labor Contract.

 

(j) _Treatment of International Business Employees_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7:

Business Employee, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate
to, offer (or continue, as applicable) employment on terms and conditions of
employment that (A) for a period of not less than twelve (12) months following
the applicable Employee Transfer Date, maintain (x) the same base wage rate or
base salary level in effect for such Current International Business Employee
immediately prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date and (y) incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are substantially no
less favorable in the aggregate than the incentive compensation opportunities
and employee benefits provided to such Current International Business Employee
immediately prior to the applicable Employee Transfer Date, and (B) on the
applicable Employee Transfer Date, provide employment at the same location at
which the applicable Current International Business Employee is employed as of
immediately prior to such Employee Transfer Date, _provided_ that a Current
International Business Employee employed at any of the locations set forth

to such Employee Transfer Date may be relocated to a location owned by
Purchaser or its Affiliates that is no more than fifty (50) kilometers from
the location at which such Current International Business Employee is
employed as of immediately prior to such Employee Transfer Date.

(ii) In the case of Current International Business Employees who become
Transferred Business Employees, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall comply with
obligations or standards arising under applicable Laws or Contracts governing
the terms and conditions of their employment or severance of employment in
connection with the Transaction or otherwise to the extent any such
obligations or standards require terms and conditions that exceed the
otherwise applicable terms and conditions of this Section 5.7. 

 



-64- (iii) In the case of any International Benefit Plan other than a Purchased
Company Benefit Plan, Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall
take any necessary actions to cause, effective as of the applicable Employee
Transfer Date, any International Business Employees (and their respective
eligible dependents and beneficiaries) who are participating in any such
International Benefit Plan to cease participation in such International
Benefit Plan.

(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
to the extent Purchaser or its Affiliates assumes any Liability attributable
to the employment before the applicable Employee Transfer Date of Former
International Business Employees by Seller or its Affiliates, whether by

Affiliates to, reimburse and otherwise indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates for all such Liabilities, except to the
extent attributable to a Purchased Company Benefit Plan.

(v) Purchaser and Seller agree to their respective covenants and agreements
set forth in Section 1.1(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and paragraph

of such Employee Transfer Date.

(l) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of Section
10.4, the provisions of this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and no current or former employee, director or
independent contractor or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and
nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan for any purpose.

 

Section 5.8 _Financial Obligations_. At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser
shall at its sole expense arrange for substitute letters of credit, surety

and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates against, the amount of each
claim, including any deductibles or self-insured retentions associated with
any claims under the Workers Compensation Policies and shall be liable for and
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
Affiliates against all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible
amounts of such claims, but solely to the extent that Seller would otherwise
be liable to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates for such claim under
Article IX. Following the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates to not, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate insurance
coverage under each of the Workers Compensation Policies with respect to acts,

contemplated under this Agreement, or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction relating to, in connection with or
arising from the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or the Specified Retained Litigation, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (and its and their officers and employees) to,

or defenses, including making available its personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to its books and records as shall be reasonably necessary

to, in connection with or arising from the Business, the Purchased Entities,
the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Specified Retained
Litigation, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (and its and their
officers and employees) to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its
counsel in such prosecution, contest or defenses, including making available
its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records
as shall be reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.11(a) and (b), the parties
agree that, with respect to the Specified Retained Litigations listed as
items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 on Section 2.7(n) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
(collectively, the " _IP Retained Litigations_ "): without Purchasers prior
written consent, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall agree to any
settlement of such IP Retained Litigation if such settlement (i) would require
Purchaser or its Affiliates to make a payment to the settling party or (ii)
would require Purchaser or its Affiliates to agree to any injunctive relief
or (iii) does not release Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective
successors and assigns, each in their capacity as successors to the Business,
to the same extent as it releases Seller and its Affiliates. At Sellers
request, Purchaser shall enter into a common interest agreement with Seller
with respect to the IP Retained Litigations, in a form to be mutually agreed
by the parties

 

(d) With respect to each of the IP Retained Litigations listed as items 6 and

Retained Litigation_ "), in the event that, at any time following the Closing,
a payment (whether one-time, ongoing or otherwise) to a third party is
required to be made for the use in the Business post-Closing of the
Intellectual Property asserted in such Named IP Retained Litigation, Seller
will bear the portion of such payment attributable to sales of the accused
products in the Business (or Business Products incorporating the accused
products) by Purchaser and its Affiliates for the first year immediately
following the Closing. In addition, with respect to each Named IP Retained
Litigation, in the event that, within the first year immediately following the
Closing, the court issues an injunction in such Named IP Retained Litigation
that prevents sales of the accused products in the Business (or Business
Products incorporating the accused products) by Purchaser and its Affiliates
post-Closing, but there are no required payments of the type described in the
immediately preceding sentence in connection with such Named IP Retained
Litigation, Seller will bear up to fifty percent (50%) of the costs incurred
by Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with the re-design of such
products or Business Products and the implementation of such re-design,
_provided_ that Sellers aggregate Liability pursuant to this sentence shall
not exceed $500,000.

contracting parties of the Business or the Purchased Companies to the extent
that they are in respect of a Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability hereunder.

solicit for employment any Covered Person or hire any Covered Person whose
name is set forth on Section 5.14(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules;
_provided_ that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be precluded from

its Subsidiaries and such individual, (ii) who responds to solicitation not
specifically targeted at employees of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including by a search firm or recruiting agency) or (iii) who initiates
discussions regarding such employment without any solicitation by Seller or

Person;

 

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person

consolidated annual revenues in the last completed fiscal year of such
Person;

(including extension thereof) applicable to such divestiture under the HSR
Act, or under any other applicable Law not having expired or been terminated,

Seller Disclosure Schedules to reflect all and only such Business
Intellectual Property that is used in the business of manufacturing, marketing

after the Closing (the " _Licensing Request Period_ "), Seller shall notify
Purchaser of any specific items of Business Intellectual Property that are
used in manufacturing, marketing or selling Retained Business Products and
were not included in Section 5.16(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
which notice shall separately and uniquely identify each such item of Business

or its applicable Affiliate to continue such use specifically identified in
such Licensing Notice and such license shall take effect as of the Closing
Date on such terms as may be mutually agreed by the parties in writing during
such thirty (30) days (or any mutually agreed extension thereof), _provided_
that Purchaser shall have no obligation to cooperate with Seller with respect
to any license for use outside the Seller Field of Use. The rights granted
pursuant to this Section 5.16(b) are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Business Intellectual Property License_."

 

(c) Without limiting Section 5.16(a) or Section 5.16(b), each licensee and its

or if Seller shall otherwise directly receive a Warranty Claim, Seller may

Claim, upon the terms and conditions, including pricing, to be mutually agreed
by Purchaser and Seller. If Seller does not respond in writing to Purchaser
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of notification of a Warranty Claim
or denies liability for a Warranty Claim, Purchaser may determine to honor or
deny such claim without prejudicing any of its rights or obligations
hereunder. Purchaser and Seller agree to make available for inspection upon
reasonable notice all records relating to the need for such work, the cost of
performing such work and the applicability of Sellers warranties to any

Consolidated Venture.

Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Tax Indemnified
Parties_ ") and hold each Seller Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and

_Section 10.2_, in each case, that is

 



-77-  neither (I) a tax resident of the same jurisdiction of which the Seller
Entity transferring such Purchased Assets (or assigning such Assumed
Liabilities) is a tax resident nor (II) a tax resident of Hungary or the
United States (including any such deduction or withholding applicable to (or
additional Taxes imposed with respect to) additional sums payable by Purchaser
pursuant to this clause (G)); and (H) any costs and expenses, including

Purchasers or the relevant Seller Tax Indemnified Partys, as applicable,
allocable share of such Taxes at the relevant time, as determined by reference
to such Persons direct or indirect ownership interest, at the relevant time,
in such Purchased Consolidated Venture or such Subsidiary of a Purchased
Consolidated Venture.

 

Section 6.3 _Straddle Periods_. To the extent permitted or required by
applicable Law, the taxable year of each of the Purchased Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries that includes the Closing Date shall be treated as
closing on (and including) the Closing Date. To the extent such treatment is
not permitted or required by applicable Law, for purposes of this
Agreement, in the case of any Straddle Period, (i) Property Taxes allocable
to the Pre-Closing Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in
the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) Taxes (other than Property Taxes)
allocable to the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed as if such taxable
period ended as of the end of the day on which the Closing occurs; _provided_
that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each period.

 

Section 6.4 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared (i) any combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Purchased Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any of the Purchased Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand (a " _Combined Tax Return_ "),
and (ii) any Tax Return (other than any Combined Tax Return) that is required
to be filed by or with respect to any of the Purchased Entities or any of
their Subsidiaries or, to the extent within the power of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than solely the Purchased Ventures or their Subsidiaries)
using commercially reasonable efforts, any of the Purchased Consolidated
Ventures or any of their Subsidiaries, for any taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Separate Tax Return_ "). Seller
shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns in
a manner consistent with past practices of the Purchased Consolidated
Companies and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, except to the extent that
Seller or the relevant Purchased Consolidated Company or Subsidiary of a
Purchased Consolidated Company determines in good faith that there is not at
least "substantial authority," within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i)
of the Code, for a particular position. Seller shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed any Combined Tax Return and any Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Return that is required to be filed on or before the Closing Date (taking
into account any

 



-78-  extensions). Seller shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser
all Pre-Closing Separate Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser shall timely file
or cause to be timely filed such Tax Returns other than any Tax Return with
respect to which Purchaser reasonably determines that such Tax Return
reflects a position with respect to a material item for which there is no
reasonable basis. In such case, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in
writing and Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement on any disputed items. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement, any remaining dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm as promptly as practicable, and Purchaser shall or shall cause
to be filed a Tax Return that reflects the resolution of such disputed item
(as agreed by the parties or as determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm). Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall not
amend or revoke any Combined Tax Return or any Pre-Closing Separate Tax
Return (or any notification or election relating thereto) without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall promptly provide (or cause to be
provided) to Seller any information reasonably requested by Seller to
facilitate the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this
Section 6.4(a) and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare (or cause to be prepared) such information in a manner and on a
timeline requested by Seller, which information and timeline shall be
consistent with the past practice of the Purchased Consolidated Companies or
their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

(b) Except for any Tax Return required to be prepared or caused to be prepared
by Seller pursuant to Section 6.4(a), Purchaser shall prepare and timely file
or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to the Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries,
and, to the extent within the power of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(other than solely the Purchased Ventures or their Subsidiaries) using
commercially reasonable efforts, the Purchased Consolidated Ventures or any of
their Subsidiaries. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period
(a " _Straddle Period Separate Tax Return_ "), Purchaser shall prepare or
cause to be prepared such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Purchased Consolidated Companies and their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, except to the extent that Purchaser or the relevant Purchased
Consolidated Company or Subsidiary of a Purchased Consolidated Company
determines in good faith that there is not at least "substantial authority,"
within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, for a particular
position. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller for its review and comment a copy
of each such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser
shall revise such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect any
reasonable comments received from Seller not later than fifteen (15) days
before the due date thereof (taking into account any extensions); _provided_
, _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be required to reflect any comments
received from Seller that are not consistent with past practices of the
Purchased Consolidated Companies or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, or for
which Seller or the relevant Purchased Consolidated Company or Subsidiary of a
Purchased Consolidated Company determines in good faith that there is not at
least "substantial authority," within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i)
of the Code, for the particular position requested by Seller. In such case,
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing and Purchaser and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith to reach agreement on any disputed items. If
Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach

 



-79-  such agreement, any remaining dispute shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm as promptly as practicable, and Purchaser shall or shall cause
to be filed a Straddle Period Separate Tax Return that reflects the
resolution of such disputed item (as agreed by the parties or as determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm). Purchaser shall not file any Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return without the prior approval of Seller (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or prior to the
resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm of all disputes with respect to
such Straddle Period Separate Return, as applicable; provided that
Purchaser may file or cause to be filed such a Straddle Period Separate Tax
Return to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any penalties for
failure to timely file such Tax Return. If Purchaser files a Straddle Period
Separate Tax Return without the prior written consent of Seller or prior to
the resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, Purchaser shall promptly amend or cause to be amended such
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return to reflect any agreement between the
parties or the resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm. Except to the
extent required pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser
shall not amend or revoke any Straddle Period Separate Tax Return (or any
notification or election relating thereto) without the prior written consent
of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). At Sellers request and expense, Purchaser shall amend any
Straddle Period Separate Tax Return unless such amendment would have an
adverse effect on Purchaser, any Purchased Consolidated Company or any
Affiliate thereof that is material.

 

Section 6.5 _Certain Tax Benefits, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks_.

 

(a) If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date,
the Purchased Consolidated Companies or their respective Subsidiaries)
realizes a Tax Benefit in respect of any taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the end of its second taxable year beginning after the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date as a result of any audit
adjustment (or adjustment in any other Tax Proceeding) made with respect to
any Tax Item by any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes for which Seller is
responsible under _Section 6.1_, then Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to Seller the amount of such Tax Benefit within fifteen (15) days of
the later of the filing of the Tax Return in which such Tax Benefit is
realized or Purchasers receipt of a written request by Seller for payment of
such amount.

 

(b) Seller shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from any Tax Item
arising in respect of any payment, loss, obligation, liability or Tax that
Seller is responsible for under this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the Closing Date, the Purchased Consolidated Companies)
shall claim any such Tax Item on any Tax Return for a Post-Closing Period;
_provided_ , that if any such Tax Item is not permitted by Law to be claimed
on a Tax Return for which Seller has filing responsibility pursuant to Section
6.4(a) and is permitted by Law to be claimed on a Tax Return for which
Purchaser has filing responsibility pursuant to Section 6.4(b), then Purchaser
shall (or shall cause its relevant Affiliate (including, after the Closing
Date, the Purchased Consolidated Companies) to) claim such Tax Item and pay
(or cause to be paid) to Seller the amount of any such Tax Benefit resulting
from such Tax Item that is realized in respect of any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the end of the second taxable year of
Purchaser or its relevant Affiliate, as applicable, beginning after the
taxable year of such entity that includes the Closing Date within fifteen (15)
days of the later of the filing of such Tax Return or Purchasers receipt of
a written request by Seller for payment of such amount.

 



-80- (c) If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date,
the Purchased Consolidated Companies) makes (or causes an Affiliate to make)
a payment to Seller pursuant to Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b) in respect of
any Tax Benefit and, as a result of any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any
other Tax Proceeding) made by any Taxing Authority the amount of such Tax
Benefit that is actually realized by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing Date, the Purchased Consolidated Companies) is less than
such amount paid to Seller pursuant to Section 6.5(a) or Section 6.5(b),
Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the excess of such amount
paid (or caused to be paid) by Purchaser and the amount of such Tax Benefit
actually realized by Purchaser or its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing Date, the Purchased Consolidated Companies) after taking into account
such adjustment.

(d) Subject to the following provisions of this Section 6.5(d), the
determination of whether Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the Closing Date, the Purchased Companies) has realized a
Tax Benefit (and the determination of the amount of any such Tax Benefit)
shall be made by the Purchaser in good faith. Seller shall have no rights to
review the Tax Returns of Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the Closing Date, the Purchased Companies) pursuant to
Section 6.5(a), (b), (c) or (d); _provided_ , that Purchaser shall provide
Seller with (A) such supporting documentation and other information reasonably
necessary to enable Seller to verify any determination of Purchaser described
in the first sentence of this Section 6.5(d) ( _e.g._ , an electronic
spreadsheet or other reasonable documentation setting forth any such Tax
Benefit and the calculation of the amount of any such Tax Benefit in
reasonable detail) or (B) a certification from the Independent Accounting Firm
(the costs of which shall be borne by Purchaser) as to the Tax Benefits (and
the amount of any such Tax Benefit) realized by Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the
Purchased Companies) (and the determination set forth in such certification
shall be binding on all parties hereto).

 

(e) Seller shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes
for which Seller is responsible under Section 6.1. Purchaser shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries of or against any Taxes other than refunds or credits to which
Seller is entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence. Any refunds or credits
of Taxes of the Purchased Consolidated Companies or their Subsidiaries for
any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and
Purchaser in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 6.3. Each
party shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the party entitled to a
refund or credit of Taxes under this Section 6.5(e), the amount of such refund
or credit (including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes to the
entity receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual
of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within fifteen (15) days
of the actual receipt of the refund or credit or the application of such
refund or credit against amounts otherwise payable. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the case of any refund or credit of Taxes imposed on or with respect
to any Purchased Consolidated Venture or Subsidiary of a Purchased
Consolidated Venture, this Section 6.5(e) shall apply only with respect to
the allocable share of such refund or credit, as determined by reference to
the relevant Persons direct or indirect ownership interest, at the relevant
time, in such Purchased Consolidated Venture or Subsidiary thereof.

 



-81- (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes for which
Purchaser is responsible under Section 6.2(G). Seller acknowledges and agrees
that Seller will (and will cause its Affiliates to) claim any refund or credit
of such Taxes on the applicable Tax Return of Seller or its Affiliates or Tax
Return for which Seller has filing responsibility pursuant to Section 6.4(a)
and otherwise will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such refund
or credit of Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Seller shall
pay (or cause to be paid) to Purchaser the amount of any such refund or credit
(including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes to the entity
receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such
refund or credit) within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of such
refund or credit or the application of such refund or credit against amounts
otherwise payable.

 

(g) Purchaser shall cause the Purchased Entities to carry forward, where
permitted by applicable Law, any item of loss, deduction or credit which
arises in any taxable period ending after the Closing Date into any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date.

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.5 shall not apply to (i) any
credit or refund of VAT (including any input VAT ( _Vorsteuer_ )) in
connection with the sale, transfer or acquisition of the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities or any portion of the Business conducted by the Purchased
Consolidated Companies and governed by Section 6.12 or (ii) any increase of
the Tax basis in the Purchased Assets as a result of the acquisition of the
Purchased Assets.

 

Section 6.6 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt
notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this
Article VI, except to the extent that the other party is prejudiced by such
failure (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). Such notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall
include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from
the Taxing Authority.

(b) Seller shall have the exclusive right to control any Tax Proceeding of or
with respect to any of the Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries
and, to the extent within the power of Seller, the Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates using commercially reasonable efforts, any of the Purchased
Consolidated Ventures or any of their Subsidiaries, for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise
or abandonment would have a material adverse impact on Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Purchased Consolidated Companies and their
Subsidiaries) for any Post-Closing Period. Seller may elect in writing not to
control any Tax Proceeding that Seller otherwise has the right to control
pursuant to the preceding sentence. If Seller makes such election with
respect to a Tax Proceeding, Purchaser shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding, and the
provisions of Section 6.6(c) shall 

 



-82-  apply, mutatis mutandis (substituting all references therein to "the
Controlling Party" with "Purchaser" and all references therein to "the Non-
Controlling Party" with "Seller"), with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

(c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to (A) any of the
Purchased Entities or any of their Subsidiaries and, to the extent within the
power of Seller, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates using commercially
reasonable efforts, any of the Purchased Consolidated Ventures or any of
their Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period (other than a Tax Proceeding
described in Section 6.6(d)) or (B) Taxes that are Excluded Business Taxes and
Taxes that are not Excluded Business Taxes, in each case, other than Taxes
imposed on any of the Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (and
such Tax Proceeding for Taxes that are Excluded Business Taxes is not
separable from such Tax Proceeding for Taxes that are not Excluded Business
Taxes), the Controlling Party shall have the right and obligation to conduct,
at its own expense, such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Controlling Party shall provide the Non-Controlling Party with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax Proceeding, (ii) the
Controlling Party shall reasonably consult with the Non-Controlling Party
before taking any significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding,
(iii) the Controlling Party shall reasonably consult with the Non-Controlling
Party and offer the Non-Controlling Party an opportunity to comment before
submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, (iv) the Controlling Party shall defend such Tax Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (v) the Controlling Party shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of the Non-Controlling Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further, that the
foregoing shall apply with respect to a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to a
Purchased Venture or Subsidiary of a Purchased Venture only to the extent
within the power of Seller, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates using
commercially reasonable efforts. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Controlling Party_ " shall mean Seller if Seller and its Affiliates are
reasonably expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such
Tax Proceeding, or Purchaser if Purchaser and its Affiliates are reasonably
expected to bear the greater Tax liability in connection with such Tax
Proceeding; and " _Non-Controlling Party_ " means whichever of Seller or
Purchaser is not the Controlling Party with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax
Proceeding with respect to (i) any Tax Return of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries) other
than any Tax Proceeding described in Section 6.6(c)(B); and (ii) any Tax
Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (including any Combined Tax Return); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any settlement, compromise or abandonment of a Tax
Proceeding with respect to a Combined Return would have a material adverse
impact on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries) for any Post-Closing Period, Seller shall
obtain the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before any such settlement,
compromise or abandonment.

 



-83- Section 6.7 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability
for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this Article VI or a right to
refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and
information shall include reasonably providing copies of all relevant portions
of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of
relevant accompanying schedules and supporting documentation, relevant
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities
and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property and
other information (including transfer pricing documentation), which any such
party may possess. Each party shall make its employees reasonably available on
a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax
matters, of the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries for their
respective Tax periods beginning on or before the Closing Date until the later
of (x) the expiration of the statute of limitations for the Tax periods to
which the Tax Returns and other documents relate, or (y) five (5) years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Thereafter,
the party holding such Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them
unless the other party first provides written notice that it intends to take
possession of such Tax Returns and other documents at its own expense.

 

Section 6.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements; Powers of Attorney_.

 

(a) To the extent relating to the Purchased Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries and, to the extent within the power of Seller or its Affiliates
using commercially reasonable efforts, any of the Purchased Consolidated
Ventures or any of their Subsidiaries, Seller shall terminate or cause to be
terminated, on or before the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements or
arrangements (other than this Agreement), if any, to which any of the
Purchased Consolidated Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Purchased
Consolidated Companies and any of their Subsidiaries), on the other hand, are
parties, and neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor any of the Purchased
Consolidated Companies or their respective Subsidiaries shall have any rights
or obligations thereunder after the Closing.

 

(b) At least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide
Purchaser with a list of all the effective powers of attorney granted by any
of the Purchased Consolidated Companies and any Subsidiary thereof (other than
powers of attorney solely relating to the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns), and Seller shall cause to be terminated prior to the Closing any
such powers of attorney granted by the Purchased Entities or any of their
Subsidiaries and, to the extent within the power of Seller or its Affiliates
using commercially reasonable efforts, any of the Purchased Consolidated
Ventures or any of their Subsidiaries, as Purchaser may direct in writing at
least ten (10) days prior to the Closing.

 



-84- Section 6.9 _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), Seller,
Purchaser, the Purchased Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this
Article VI, Section 2.10, and Article IX as an adjustment to the purchase
price for Tax purposes.

 

Section 6.10 _Certain Tax Elections_. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Companies) not to make any election with respect to
(including any election pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3),
or change any method of tax accounting or any tax accounting period of,
any Purchased Company or any Subsidiary thereof, which election or change
would be effective on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.11 _Additional Post-Closing Tax Covenant_. With respect to any of
the Purchased Companies or any of their Subsidiaries listed on Section 6.11
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, from the date of the Closing through the
end of the taxable period of such entity that includes the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries and, to the extent within the power of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates using commercially reasonable efforts, any
of the Purchased Consolidated Ventures or any of their Subsidiaries) not to,
enter into any extraordinary transaction with respect to such Purchased
Companies or otherwise take any action or enter into any transaction outside
of the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice that
would be considered under the Code to constitute the payment of an actual or
deemed dividend by such Purchased Company, including pursuant to Section 304
of the Code, or that would otherwise result in a diminution of foreign tax
credits that, absent such transaction may be claimed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 6.12 _Transfer Taxes; VAT_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Seller
and Purchaser shall pay, when due, and be responsible for, fifty percent
(50%) of any sales, use, transfer (including real estate transfer),
documentary, stamp or similar Taxes (other than VAT) and related fees imposed
on or payable with respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets
pursuant to this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). The party responsible
under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a
copy of such Tax Return to the other party. Seller and Purchaser shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and
file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes,
including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

(b) _VAT, Generally_.

 

(i) The amount of any payment for a supply of goods or for services or the
value of any supply made or deemed to be made by Seller or any of the Seller
Entities pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any other agreement that is
intended to effect the transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to this
Agreement (including any assignment and bill of sale, assumption agreement,
real estate deed, or other instrument of conveyance) shall be

 



-85-  exclusive of any such VAT properly chargeable on the supply, and the amount
of such VAT shall be paid by the recipient of such supply in addition to any
payment due under this Agreement at the time that a proper VAT invoice is
issued, except in the case of Mexican VAT and German VAT (which shall be
governed exclusively by Section 6.12(b)(ii), (b)(iii), (c) and (d)). The
parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts under the terms of
applicable VAT Laws to carry out the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement in the most efficient way to reduce or mitigate the imposition or
payment of any VAT, except in the case of Mexican VAT and German VAT (which
shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.12(b)(ii), (b)(iii), (c) and (d)).

(ii) If Mexican VAT or German VAT is required to be paid with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement, then the
amount of such VAT shall be paid (or caused to be paid) by Purchaser in
addition to any payment due under this Agreement at the time that a proper
VAT invoice in compliance with applicable VAT laws is issued. Purchaser shall
and shall cause its relevant Affiliates (including the Purchased Consolidated
Companies after the Closing) to use reasonable best efforts to pursue all
remedies reasonably available under applicable Law to obtain a refund or
credit of such VAT and shall keep Seller fully informed of such efforts,
including by providing to Seller all relevant documents and other information
prepared or submitted to any Taxing Authority in connection with such
efforts. Seller shall pay to Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
any such VAT paid (or caused to be paid) by Purchaser pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 6.12(b)(ii) and for which Purchaser (or an Affiliate
of Purchaser) is not able to obtain a refund or credit (such amount, the "
_VAT Leakage_ ") by the first anniversary of the date on which such VAT is
required to be paid to the relevant Taxing Authority (such date with respect
to any VAT, the " _VAT Recovery Outside Date_ "), unless and to the extent
that such VAT Leakage results from or arises out of (i) Purchasers breach of
the covenant set forth in the immediately preceding sentence or (ii) any
action taken or transaction entered into by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Companies) after the Closing (other than any action
required pursuant to this Agreement, including any action referred to
in Section 1.1(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Section 1.1(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to fifty percent (50%) of any refund
or credit of any VAT in respect of which Seller has made a payment to
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.12(b)(ii) or Section 6.12(b)(iii) that is
obtained by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the VAT Recovery Outside
Date and Purchaser shall pay to Seller fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
any such refund or credit of VAT (including any interest, and in the case of
Mexico, any inflationary or other additional credits generated under
applicable Law, paid thereon and net of any Taxes to the entity receiving
such refund or credit in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or
credit) within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of such refund or
credit or the application of such refund or credit against amounts otherwise
payable. For purposes of determining whether Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates has obtained a refund or credit of any Mexican VAT or German VAT
that is required to be paid with respect to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise required
under applicable Law, VAT refunds and credits shall be treated as obtained in
the order in which the underlying VAT payments were made. Purchaser shall
provide Seller with (A) such supporting documentation and other information
reasonably necessary to enable Seller to verify the amount of any refunds or
credits of any such Mexican VAT or German VAT ( _e.g._ , an electronic
spreadsheet or other reasonable documentation setting forth any such refunds
or credits and the

 



-86-  calculation of the amount of any such refunds or credits in reasonable
detail) or (B) a certification from the Independent Accounting Firm (the costs
of which shall be borne by Purchaser) as to the amount of any refunds or
credits of any such Mexican VAT or German VAT (and the determination set forth
in such certification shall be binding on all parties hereto).

 

(iii) If, as a result of any audit adjustment (or adjustment in any Tax
Proceeding) made by any Mexican or German Taxing Authority, as applicable,
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is required to repay any portion of any
refund or credit of any Mexican VAT or German VAT paid by Purchaser with
respect to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this
Agreement, Seller shall pay to Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the amount so
required to be repaid; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be required to make
any payment pursuant to this Section 6.12(b)(iii) to the extent the relevant
audit adjustment (or adjustment in any Tax Proceeding) is a result of any
action taken or transaction entered into by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Purchased Companies) after the Closing (other than any such
action required pursuant to this Agreement, including any action referred to
in Section 1.1(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Section 1.1(g) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules).

 

(c) _Mexican VAT_. Considering that the Purchased Assets include goods that
were acquired in Mexican territory or that were permanently imported into
Mexico for customs purposes, as well as goods that were temporarily imported
into Mexico for customs purposes and continue to be under such customs regime
using the Sellers (or its Affiliates) Maquila Program, the parties agree to
carry out all necessary steps in order to ensure that the qualifying
transactions contemplated under this Agreement satisfy the customs scheme
known as "virtual transfers" in accordance with the Mexican Customs Act and
the Trade and Customs Miscellaneous Rules, all as applicable on the Closing
Date, including the filing of one or more export summary or "pedimento"
(export customs declaration) by Seller or its Affiliates as needed and one or
more import summary or "pedimento" (import customs declaration) by Purchaser
or its Affiliates, the addition of any necessary information or notes in the
Tax invoices to be issued by Seller or its Affiliates, and the identification
of the number of the Maquila Program of the Mexican entity to which the
relevant Purchased Assets will be physically delivered or sold in Mexico. If
on the Closing Date it is not possible to carry out a virtual transfer in
accordance with the preceding sentence, the parties agree to use their
reasonable best efforts, under the terms of the Mexican legislation, including
the Value Added Tax Act and Customs Act and their applicable rules, to carry
out transactions contemplated under this Agreement in the most efficient way
to reduce or mitigate the amount of Mexican VAT imposed on the purchase and
transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. The parties agree
that Purchaser will be responsible for the payment of any Mexican import
duties arising from the purchase and virtual importation of the Purchased
Assets that are being sold and transferred in accordance with this Agreement,
except to the extent such import duties were required to have been previously
paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates upon the prior importation of such
Purchased Assets (for which Seller shall be responsible).

(d) _German VAT_.

 

(i) Seller and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to) reasonably cooperate to minimize any German VAT on the purchase and
transfer of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that
the parties shall treat the

 



-87-  purchase and transfer of the Purchased Assets held by a German Seller Entity
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _German Assets_ ") pursuant to this
Agreement (the " _German Asset Sale_ ") as a sale and transfer of a business
as a going concern ( _Gesch aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_) within the meaning of
Section 1 para. 1a German Value Added Tax Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) that
is not subject to German VAT ( _nicht umsatzsteuerbar_ ) solely if and to the
extent Seller determines in good faith that such treatment is required under
applicable Law (and if Seller so determines that such treatment is required,
(x) Seller shall promptly (and at least ten (10) days prior to issuing a VAT
invoice reflecting such determination) notify Purchaser in writing of such
determination and (y) the parties shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
treatment).

(ii) If and to the extent that the German Asset Sale is treated by the
parties pursuant to Section 6.12(d)(i) as a sale and transfer of a business as
a going concern ( _Gesch aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_) within the meaning of
Section 1 para. 1a German Value Added Tax Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ),
Seller shall provide Purchaser with the relevant information relating to
ongoing adjustment periods according to sec. 15a of the German Value Added Tax
Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) for the German Assets, in particular: (A) the
date of first use of the relevant German Assets, (B) the details according to
claimed input VAT deduction according to sec. 15 of the German Value Added Tax
Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) and (C) past corrections according to sec. 15a
of the German Value Added Tax Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ); _provided_ , that
Seller shall provide to Purchaser such supporting documentation with respect
to the foregoing reasonably requested by Purchaser in writing.

(iii) If and to the extent the German Asset Sale is not treated by the parties
pursuant to Section 6.12(d)(i) as, or a competent German Taxing Authority
determines and states in assessment notices or other written notifications
that the German Asset Sale does not constitute, a sale and transfer of a
business as a going concern ( _Gesch aftsveraußerung im Ganzen_) within the
meaning of Section 1 para. 1a German Value Added Tax Act (
_Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ), Seller shall confirm that the respective Seller Entity
transferring the German Business (each a " _German Seller Entity_ ") is, as
of the date hereof, an entrepreneur ( _Unternehmer_ ) as defined in Section 2
of the German Value Added Tax Act ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) and that the German
Asset Sale is part of its entrepreneurial activities.

Section 6.13 _Timing of Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be made
pursuant to this Article VI shall be made within ten (10) days after the
indemnified party makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no
case earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

Section 6.14 _Tax Matters Coordination and Survival_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, indemnification
with respect to Taxes (other than Taxes of any Purchased Non-Consolidated
Venture or any Subsidiary thereof, if any) and the procedures relating thereto
shall be governed exclusively by this Article VI and Section 1.1(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, and the provisions of Article IX shall not apply.
The indemnification obligations contained in this Article VI and the
representations and warranties made pursuant to Section 3.14(g) and Section
3.14(q) shall survive the Closing Date until sixty (60) days following the
expiration of the applicable statutory periods of limitations (including any
extensions or waivers thereof).

contained in Article IV of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct or
Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any

the aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties Covered Losses under
Section 9.3(a)(i) exceeds the Deductible, after which Purchaser shall be
obligated for all the Seller Indemnified Parties Covered Losses under Section
9.3(a)(i) in excess of the Deductible, subject to Section 9.3(b)(ii);
_provided_ that any claim for indemnification under Section 9.3(a)(i)
resulting from a breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation shall not be
subject to the Deductible; and

 

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of Purchaser under Section
9.3(a)(i) (other than any indemnification obligation under Section 9.3(a)(i)
resulting from a breach of a Purchaser Fundamental Representation) shall in no
event exceed the Cap.

 

Section 9.4 _Procedures_. (a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified
under this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the
party or parties liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand that the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to
give rise to such right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such
claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail, to
the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, the facts and circumstances
with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ that
neither the failure to provide such notice nor any deficiency in such notice
shall release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this
Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
materially prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices
for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in Section 9.1 for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a), the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the

 



-94-  receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and
control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party),
which notice shall state that, assuming the facts then presented to the
Indemnifying Party by the Indemnified Party is true, the Indemnifying Party
shall indemnify the Indemnified Party for the entirety of all Covered Losses
the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from arising out of, relating to,
in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the extent provided in
this Article IX. Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
one separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense as counsel of
record, if applicable, in such action or proceeding (and the parties shall
jointly control the defense), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) there
exists any actual or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third
Party Claim that would make representation by the same counsel or the counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third Party Claim
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or
(iii) such Third Party Claim is related to or otherwise arises in connection
with any criminal or regulatory enforcement Action. In any other event not set
forth in the previous sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. In any
event, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their counsel
shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this
Article IX and keep such Persons informed of all developments relating to any
such Third Party Claims, and provide copies of all relevant correspondence and
documentation relating thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(b),
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such defense,
but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records,
personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a
Third Party Claim, it shall not be authorized to consent to a settlement
or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party unless (A)
the Indemnified Party, as a condition to settlement, is given a complete and
unconditional release of any and all Liability by all relevant parties to
such claim or demand, (B) the damages payable under the settlement are limited
only to monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified
by the Indemnifying Party and (C) such Third Party Claim does not involve any
non-monetary relief of any kind (including any injunctive relief) or encumber
any assets of any Indemnified Party or finding or admission of any violation
of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. No
Indemnified Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge
and agree that, except in the case of fraud and willful misconduct and with
respect to any matter relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively
by Article VI, other than Taxes of any Purchased Non-Consolidated Venture or
any Subsidiary thereof, which shall be governed by this Article IX to
the extent such Taxes are Retained Liabilities), following the Closing, the

 



-95-  indemnification provisions of Section 9.2 and Section 9.3 shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, for any
Covered Losses (including any Covered Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and
whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise)
that each party hereto may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to,
as a result of or in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or the
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement by any party hereto, or
any failure by any party hereto to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties hereby irrevocably waive any right
of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.

 

Section 9.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, the amount of Covered
Losses shall be net of any third-party insurance or indemnity, contribution or
similar proceeds that have been recovered (net of any costs incurred to
recover such proceeds) by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that if
third-party insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar proceeds in
respect of such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the
Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of
its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly
remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the indemnification
payment made), and the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Affiliates
to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all insurance
and indemnity, contribution or similar provisions covering such Covered Loss
to the same extent as it would if such Covered Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party
for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which
the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties with respect to the
subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified
Party shall assign any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 9.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including this Article IX), neither
party shall be liable to the other party or its Affiliates, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at
law or in equity, and " _Covered Losses_ " shall not include any amounts
for punitive damages or damages that are not reasonably foreseeable, in each
case, except to the extent awarded against an Indemnified Party in connection
with a Third Party Claim.

 

Section 9.8 _Bulk Sales Waiver_. Purchaser and its Affiliates waive compliance
by Seller and its Affiliates with the provisions of any so-called "bulk
transfer law" or "bulk sales law" (or any similar Tax law) of any jurisdiction
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties shall (i) exclude, and
cooperate in order to exclude, any secondary liabilities of Purchaser or its
Affiliates in connection with the German Assets (including any liabilities
arising pursuant to sec. 25 of the German Commercial Code (
_Handelsgesetzbuch_ )) which relate to any Pre-Closing Period, and (ii) effect
the requisite entries into the respective commercial registers.

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, along with the Seller Disclosure Schedules and
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to
such subject matter. Neither party hereto shall be liable or bound to the
other party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants
relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth herein and
therein.

Section 10.2 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
and obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by either party
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto. Any attempted assignment in violation of
this Section 10.2 shall be void. Subject to the two preceding sentences, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
and their respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser may (a) assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement, or delegate all or any portion of its obligations under this
Agreement, in each case with reference to all or any portion of the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or any of the Purchased Companies, to any
of its Affiliates, without Sellers consent by providing Seller with a written
document executed by Purchaser and such Affiliate evidencing such assignment
and (b) grant a security interest and/or collateral assignment to its lenders
of its rights and benefits arising under this Agreement; _provided_ that no
such assignment or delegation or grant of a security interest will relieve or
release Purchaser from any of its Liabilities or obligations hereunder.

 

Section 10.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.
By an instrument in writing, Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or provision of
this Agreement that the other party was or is obligated to comply with or
perform. Such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such term
or provision shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure of compliance.

 

Section 10.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Section 9.2 and
Section 9.3, which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the
parties specified therein, this Agreement, together with the other Transaction
Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto are not intended
to confer in or on behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and
their successors and assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or
remedies with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof.

 



-97- Section 10.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to
any party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and
agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions 

 



-98-  hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or
in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in
equity. Any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Michigan, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Michigan. In addition, each of the parties (a) submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Third (3rd) Circuit Court of the State
of Michigan, County of Wayne, or the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Michigan located in Detroit, Michigan, in the event that
any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this
Agreement or the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby;
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (c)
agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby in any court other
than the Third (3rd) Circuit Court of the State of Michigan, County of Wayne,
or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
located in Detroit, Michigan; and (d) agrees that it will not seek to assert
by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, that any such Proceeding (i) is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) should be transferred or removed to any
court other than one of the above-named courts, (iii) should be stayed by
reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any court other than one of
the above-named court, or (iv) that this Agreement or the subject matter
hereof may not be enforced in or by the above-named courts. Each party hereto
agrees that service of process upon such party in any such Proceeding shall
be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 10.5.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 10.7, a party may commence any
Action in in any court other than the above-named courts solely for the
purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named
courts relating to any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM
AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT,
OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE ADMINISTRATION
THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREIN OR THEREIN. NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY
LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED
UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY
HERETO WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN
WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN
WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER

 



-99-  INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS
AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 10.8. NO PARTY HERETO HAS
IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS
OF THIS SECTION 10.8 WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

Section 10.9  _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transaction and
the other transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument, and shall become effective when one (1) or more such counterparts
have been signed by each party hereto and delivered (by facsimile, e-mail, or
otherwise) to the other party. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".
_pdf_ ") from, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signatures. This Agreement has been executed in the English language. If this
Agreement is translated into another language, the English language text
shall in any event prevail.

Section 10.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not
the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. 

Section 10.12 _Interpretation; Absence of Presumption_. It is understood and
agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any
specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure
Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of such
amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or Purchaser Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
in this Agreement or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.
Nothing herein (including in the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules) shall be deemed an admission by either party hereto or
any of its Affiliates, in any Proceeding or Action, that such party or any
such Affiliate, or any third party, is or is not in breach or violation of, or
in default in, the

 



-100-  performance or observance of any term or provisions of any Contract. For the

the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be held to include

form; (h) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events and
transactions; (i) the headings contained in this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in

Transaction Documents; (j) Seller and Purchaser have each participated in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation should arise,
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto or thereto, as applicable, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening either party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents; (k) a reference to any Person includes such
Persons successors and permitted assigns; (l) any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; (m) reference to
a document being "made available" shall mean such document was provided to
Purchaser or its Representatives via electronic mail, or a copy of such
document was posted (and made accessible to Purchaser or its Representatives)
