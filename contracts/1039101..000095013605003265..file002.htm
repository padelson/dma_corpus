ARTICLE 3   CONVERSION OF SHARES   3.1. MERGER CONSIDERATION. The manner and basis of converting the shares of Company Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger shall be as set forth in this Section 3.1. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any holder of Company Common Stock or holder of capital stock of Merger Sub:   (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.1, each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any treasury shares and shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, which will be cancelled in accordance with Section 3.1(c), and Dissenting Shares, which will be treated in accordance with    2    Merger Agreement  Section 3.3) shall be converted into the right to receive $23.10, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Company Certificates and Company Book-Entry Shares hereunder for the Merger Consideration.   (c) Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   (d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired, and each holder of a Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration applicable thereto pursuant to Section 3.1(a).   (e) The Company, immediately before the Effective Time, shall cancel all rights with respect to each outstanding option or right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Options") under any employee or director stock option or stock purchase plan or arrangement or agreement of the Company listed on Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), and Parent immediately after the Effective Time shall pay (less applicable withholdings and without interest) to each holder of a Company Stock Option which has been cancelled an amount equal to (A) times (B), where (A) equals $23.10 minus the per share exercise price under his or her Company Stock Option and (B) is the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to his or her Company Stock Option immediately before the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time and subject to the effectiveness of the Merger, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary (under the plans and/or agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Options are outstanding and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 3.1(e). The foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(e) shall not apply to the following Company Stock Option Plans: the Company\'s 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company\'s 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Company\'s 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code (the "Company ESPPs"). The Company ESPPs and all outstanding rights thereunder shall terminate at the Effective Time and the offering periods thereunder shall be deemed to end on the NYSE trading day immediately following the date hereof, and the rights of each participating employee then outstanding shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on such NYSE trading day. On such trading day, each participating employee will be credited with the number of shares of Company Common Stock purchased for his or her account(s) under the Company ESPPs during such offering period. The Board of Directors of the Company shall send written notice of the Merger that will result in the termination of the Company ESPPs to all participating employees not later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof. No new offering periods will be allowed to commence under the Company ESPPs during the period prior to the Closing unless this Agreement has been terminated.    3    Merger Agreement   (f) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant listed on Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be converted into a warrant to receive cash as provided in this Section 3.1(f). Following the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Warrant shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Warrant, except that   (x) each such Company Warrant shall be exercisable for $23.10 in cash  for each share of Company Common Stock into which such Company Warrant may  be exercised (the "Warrant Consideration"); and   (y) the exercise price payable to receive the Warrant Consideration  shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock  under such Company Warrant at the Effective Time.   3.2. MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   3.3. DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such Company Common Stock in accordance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the relevant Merger Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by the DGCL, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, in which case such shares of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the relevant Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 3.1, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and withdrawals of such demands, any other instruments or documents served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company with respect to such demands, and the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such Dissenting Shares under the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation and as of the Effective Time such shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist.   3.4. SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.   (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of certificates representing outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Certificates") or shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry ("Company Book-Entry Shares") (in    4    Merger Agreement  each case, other than Dissenting Shares), a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) (the "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Certificates or, in the case of Company Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. After the Effective Time, upon surrender in accordance with this Section 3.4(a), to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the holder of such Company Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange therefor, the Merger Consideration (without interest), to be received by the holder thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company or its transfer agent of shares of Company Common Stock and, if Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Company Certificate surrendered for exchange is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Company or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Certificate surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.4(a), each Company Certificate and each Company Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 3.1.   (b) The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock so exchanged.   (c) At any time following the date which is nine months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Company Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange    5    Merger Agreement  Agent shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for cash delivered to public officials pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws.   (d) If any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate.   3.5. CLOSING. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York New York 10017-3954, or such other location as shall be mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company on the Business Day immediately following the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (other than the delivery of certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing, but subject to the delivery at the Closing of such certificates, opinions and other instruments and documents) is fulfilled or waived, or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree (the date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date").   3.6. WITHHOLDING. Parent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the aggregate Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Common Stock all amounts required by law to be deducted or withheld therefrom. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or Merger Sub, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or Merger Sub.
