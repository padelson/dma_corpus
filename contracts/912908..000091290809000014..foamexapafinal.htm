Section 2.5

     |  

_**Contract Designation Rights**_.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, Sellers shall have delivered to
Purchaser a list of (i) all Material Contracts to which any Seller is a party,
(ii) the amount of the Cure Costs associated with each Material Contract
identified in Section 5.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and (iii) any

  



  

 

  

22   



  

 

  



  

Material Contracts entered into by Sellers during the pendency of the
Bankruptcy Case. To the Knowledge of Sellers, such list shall also contain a
list of all other Contracts to which Sellers are a party, other than such
Contracts that are immaterial to the Business. Sellers shall cooperate with
and provide such additional information to Purchaser in order to identify and
provide to Purchaser as  promptly as practicable all Material Contracts
related to the Business (and the related Cure Costs), as well as Cure Costs of
non-Material Contracts, and subject to assumption or rejection hereunder.

  

(b) Any motions filed by Sellers with, and any proposed orders submitted
by Sellers to, the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization after the date
hereof to assume or reject any Contracts, or any notices of disclaimer,
resiliation, or repudiation given by any Seller in the Canadian Proceeding
shall be satisfactory in form and substance to  Purchaser in its reasonable
discretion. As set forth in the Approval Order, no later than twenty (20) days
prior to the Sale Hearing, the Sellers shall cause notice to be provided to
all counterparties to the Contracts, substantially in the form annexed to the
Approval Motion as Exhibit D regarding the (i) assumption and assignment to
Purchaser all of the Contracts, except for any such Contracts which Purchaser
previously has advised Sellers in writing that it does not wish to  assume
(and Sellers shall thereupon be under no obligation to seek assumption and
assignment to Purchaser of any such Contracts), and (ii) fixing of the Cure
Costs associated with each Contract as of the Sale Hearing (or as of such
later date reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers). Sellers shall
consult with, and give due consideration to the views and concerns of,
Purchaser prior to compromising or commencing any Action with respect to any
material payment required to be  made under the Bankruptcy Code to effectuate
the assumption of any such Contract, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to provide five (5) days notice of any such compromise or Action to
Purchasers.

  

(c) For the purpose of determining whether a Contract of Sellers shall
be included as a Purchased Contract or an Excluded Asset, from and after the
filing of the Approval Motion all such Contracts shall be treated as follows:

  

(i) no later than three (3) days prior to the day of the Auction,
Purchaser shall notify Sellers in writing of those Contracts which Purchaser
desires to be designated to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to Purchaser on
the Closing Date, with Purchaser responsible for all Cure Costs associated
therewith;  _provided, however_ , each such Contract identified in Section
5.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule as a Material Contract shall be
designated to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to Purchaser, with Purchaser
responsible for all Cure Costs associated therewith, unless otherwise
specifically noted in such Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (in which
case each such Contract shall be deemed rejected and shall not be  purchased
by Purchaser as a Purchased Contract);

  

(ii) each of such Contracts entered into during the pendency of the
Bankruptcy Case shall be designated to be assigned to Purchaser, unless
Purchaser notifies Sellers in writing that it will not purchase such Contract,
in which case such Contract shall not be assigned to Purchaser and shall be
included as an Excluded  Asset; _provided, however,_ if such Contract was
required to be identified in Section 5.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
as a Material Contract and was not identified or was entered into on or after
the date hereof in breach of this Agreement then such Contract shall not be
assigned to or purchased by Purchaser; and

  

(iii) after the Auction but in any event no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall notify Sellers in writing of
any Contracts which Purchaser does not desire to be assumed by Sellers and
assigned to Purchaser, in which case any such Contracts shall not be assigned
to Purchaser and shall be  included as Excluded Assets and may be rejected by
Sellers.

  



  

 

  

23   



  

 

  



  

Any Contract designated to be assumed and assigned hereunder shall be
accompanied by such information or documentation related to "adequate
assurance of future performance" as shall be reasonably required in connection
with the assumption and assignment of such Contract, and upon Bankruptcy Court
approval for the assumption and assignment thereof to Purchaser, shall
constitute a  Purchased Asset hereunder. Any Contract that is not assumed as
provided above shall be an Excluded Asset, and shall not constitute a
Purchased Asset hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, to the extent that, prior to Closing, any Purchased
Contract is not subject to an order of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to
the assumption and assignment of such Purchased Contract, any Liabilities of
Sellers related to such Purchased Contract shall be  the responsibility of
Sellers until such Purchased Contract is either assumed by Sellers and
assigned to Purchaser or rejected by Sellers.

  

(d) At Closing, to the extent not previously paid, Purchaser shall pay
or cause to be paid (and shall reimburse or cause to be reimbursed to Sellers
on an after-Tax basis any amounts paid after the date hereof in respect of)
any and all Cure Costs in respect of all prepetition Contracts that are
Purchased Contracts.

  

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt by
Sellers to assign any Contract to the extent that such Contract is not
assignable under the Bankruptcy Code or the CCAA or otherwise without the
consent of the other party or parties thereto, and the consent of such other
party has not been given or received, as  applicable. With respect to any
Contract for which the consent of a party thereto to the assignment thereof
shall not have been obtained at Closing and any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, to the extent Purchaser waives the
condition set forth in _Section_9.2(f)_ (to the extent applicable), Sellers
and Purchaser shall use their reasonable good faith efforts to obtain as
expeditiously as possible the  written consent of the other party or parties
to such Contract necessary for the assignment thereof to Purchaser. Unless and
until any such consent, waiver, confirmation, novation or approval is
obtained, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate to establish an arrangement
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser under which Purchaser would obtain the
claims, rights and benefits and assume the corresponding Liabilities and
obligations thereunder (including by means of any subcontracting, 
sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) or under which Sellers would enforce
for the benefit of Purchaser, with Purchaser assuming and agreeing to pay
Sellers\' obligations (other than any related Cure Costs), any and all claims,
rights and benefits of Sellers against a third party thereto. In such event,
(i) Sellers will hold in trust for and promptly pay to Purchaser, when
received, all moneys received by them under any such Contract or any claim,
right or benefit arising  thereunder and (ii) Purchaser will promptly pay,
perform or discharge, when due, any and all obligations and Liabilities
arising thereunder (other than any related Cure Costs), other than those being
contested in good faith. Purchaser acknowledges that no adjustment to the
Purchase Price shall be made for any such Contracts that are not assigned and
that Purchaser shall have no claim against Sellers in respect of such
unassigned Contracts. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed a  waiver of
Purchaser\'s right to receive an effective assignment of all of the Purchased
Assets at Closing nor shall any Contracts covered by this paragraph be deemed
to constitute Excluded Assets solely by virtue of this paragraph. Sellers\'
obligations under this paragraph shall terminate on the date that is ninety
(90) days after the Closing Date.

  

Section 2.6 _ **Transferred Benefit Plans**_. On or prior to the date
hereof, Sellers have delivered to Purchaser Section 2.6 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, which includes a list of all Benefit Plans currently
anticipated to be assumed by and assigned to Purchaser on the Closing Date. 
Purchaser shall have the right to add or remove any Benefit Plans from Section
2.6 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, until three (3) days prior to the date
of the Auction. Those Benefit Plans set forth in Section 2.6 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule on such date shall be assumed by and assigned to Purchaser
on the Closing Date (the " **Transferred Benefit Plans** ").

termination of this Agreement.

Capital is set forth in _Section_3.3(c)_.

  

(b) The " **Final Cash Purchase Price** " shall be a cash amount equal

Credit Amount, (y) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which Final Working Capital

unless the positive or negative difference between Final Working Capital and

Price, each of which shall be certified as prepared in accordance with this
Agreement by Foamex Inc.\'s chief financial officer. Within two (2) Business
Days after such delivery, if Purchaser has any objections to Sellers\'
calculation of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price, Purchaser shall provide a
written statement of its objections to Sellers; _provided_ that such
objections shall be limited to mathematical errors or the  failure to include
a material component of Current Assets or Current Liabilities in the
calculation of Working Capital. The parties shall use their respective good
faith efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the calculation of the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price as promptly as practicable. Sellers shall
prepare and

  



  

 

  

25   



  

 

  



  

deliver to Purchaser, no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers\' final calculation of Estimated Working Capital and the
Estimated Cash Purchase Price, which shall be conclusive for purposes of
_Section 3.3(a)_.

  

(d) Not more than forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers: (i) a statement (the "
**Closing Statement** ") of its calculation of the Working Capital (the "
**Final Working Capital** ") and (ii)  its calculation of the Final Cash
Purchase Price, each of which shall be certified as prepared in accordance
with this Agreement by Purchaser\'s chief financial officer.

  

(i) The Closing Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties unless Sellers give written notice of their disagreement with any
component of the Closing Statement (the " **Notice of Disagreement** ") to
Purchaser within fifteen (15) Business Days following  Sellers\' receipt
thereof. The Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any such disagreement. If a Notice of Disagreement complying with
the preceding sentence is received by Purchaser in a timely manner, then the
Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below)
shall become final, binding and non-appealable (after complying with _Section
3.3(d)(ii)_ ) upon the earlier of (x) the  date on which the parties resolve
in writing any disputes with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement or (y) the date on which any such disputes are finally resolved
in writing by the Accounting Firm.

  

(ii) During the thirty (30) day period following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement in compliance with paragraph (i) above, the parties
shall seek in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such thirty (30)
day period, the parties have  not resolved such disputes, the parties shall
submit to the national office of a mutually acceptable "big four" accounting
firm (the " **Accounting Firm** ") for review and resolution of any and all
matters that remain in dispute. The parties shall use their respective good
faith efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision resolving the
matters in dispute within thirty (30) days following the submission of such
matters to  the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm\'s determination shall

final, binding and non-appealable, absent manifest or mathematical errors. All
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers and
Purchaser.

3.3 (but in any event, within five (5) Business Days after such
determination):

more than $2,000,000, then Foamex Inc. and Purchaser shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to disburse (1) to Purchaser from the Escrow Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser,
the amount by which the Estimated  Working Capital exceeds the Final Working
Capital, together with interest earned thereon and (2) to Foamex Inc., the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount (if any), together with interest earned
thereon, after the payment to Purchaser in accordance with the foregoing
clause (1), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Sellers; or

  

(b) If the Final Working Capital equals or exceeds the Estimated Working
Capital, then Foamex Inc. and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Escrow

exceeds the Estimated Working Capital, together with interest thereon between

Purchaser and Sellers agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Escrow Amount shall be the sole
source of recovery for any purchase price adjustments in favor of Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ and any adjustments to the Purchase Price in
favor of Purchaser as a result of the application  of this _Section 3.4_
shall not exceed the Escrow Amounts.

after the Final Cash Purchase Price has been determined pursuant to Section
3.3 (but in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after such
determination), Purchaser shall provide Sellers with an allocation of the 
Purchase Price as determined for Tax purposes among the Purchased Assets on a
Seller-by-Seller basis. Such allocation schedule shall be prepared in
accordance with Section 1060 of the IRC for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
(or in accordance with other Tax Laws, as applicable) and shall be binding on
Purchaser and Sellers. The parties shall cooperate with each other and provide
such information as any of them shall reasonably request in connection with
this Section 3.5.  The parties will each report the federal, state and local

provisions of this Agreement. Purchaser shall file the joint elections with
the returns required to be filed by Purchaser under the Excise Tax Act

reporting periods in which the sale was made, in compliance with the
requirements of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and an Act Respecting the Quebec

disclosed therein) and except as set forth in the disclosure schedule
delivered by Sellers (the " **Seller Disclosure  Schedule** ") to Purchaser
simultaneously with the execution and delivery hereof, Sellers jointly and

Seller and Purchased Subsidiary is an entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is

or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed (individually

Adverse Effect. Each Seller has  delivered to Purchaser complete and correct

subject to entry of the Sale Order and the entry of the

  



  

 

  

31   



  

 

  



  

Sale Order Recognition Order, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
each Seller, enforceable against each Seller in accordance with its terms,
subject to (x) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors\' rights generally and (y) general principles of equity, regardless
of whether enforcement is  sought in a proceeding at law or in equity.

  

(b) Subject to the Bankruptcy Court\'s entry of the Approval Order and
the Sale Order and the Canadian Court\'s entry of the Approval Order
Recognition Order and the Sale Order Recognition Order, the execution and
delivery by Sellers of this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents to
which a Seller is a party does not, and the consummation  by Sellers of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents
to which a Seller is a party, and compliance by Sellers with the provisions of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Documents to which a Seller is a
party, shall not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
obligation or  to a loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of any Seller or any Purchased
Subsidiary under (i) the Fundamental Documents of any Seller or Purchased
Subsidiary or (ii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in _Section 5.3(c)_ , any judgment, order, decree, statute, Law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to any Seller or its respective 
properties or assets other than any such conflicts, violations, defaults,
rights, losses or Liens that (individually or in the aggregate) would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

(c) No Consent of any Governmental Authority, or any third party, is
required by or with respect to any Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Seller,
or the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for (i) the Consents set  forth in Section 5.3(c) of the

(d) Neither the aggregate value of the Purchased Assets, nor the
aggregate value of the gross revenues from sales in or from Canada generated
from the Purchased Assets, exceeds the threshold value set forth in Section
110(2) of the Competition Act (Canada) and accordingly the transactions
completed by this Agreement are not subject to  review under the Competition
Act (Canada). The transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not subject
to review under Part IV of the Investment Canada Act on the grounds that the
thresholds set forth in Section 14.1 of the Investment Canada Act are not met.

Seller or Purchased  Subsidiary has waived or altered its rights thereunder,

Subsidiary to use such property in the operation of the Business as currently
conducted.

contemplated special assessments or reassessments of any parcel included in

Real Estate or in the rent, additional rent or other sums and changes payable
by any Sellers or Purchased Subsidiaries under the Leases.

property Tax purposes as a wholly-independent Tax lot, separate and apart from

or advisory letter) that has not been revoked, and (A) there are no existing
circumstances or events that have occurred that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect in any material respect the qualified status of any

failing to accept such eligible rollover distributions.

  

(c) Each Transferred Benefit Plan has been administered and is in
compliance in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all
applicable Laws, except where, with respect to any Transferred Benefit Plan of

resulted in and could not reasonably be  expected to result in a Mexican MAE.
Except as set forth in Section 5.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no
prohibited transaction has occurred (i) with respect to any Seller Benefit
Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to
the Purchaser or (ii) with respect to any Benefit Plan of a Purchased
Subsidiary, a Mexican MAE. All contributions required to be made to any
Transferred Benefit Plan by applicable Laws or regulations for any period 
through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected in the SEC Documents and the Financial Statements, except

expected to result in a Mexican MAE. Only to the extent that Section 280G(a)
of the IRC is applicable to any Purchased Subsidiary, without limiting the

been asserted or instituted against the Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Benefit  Plans, any other persons with

and (b) is duly qualified to conduct business and is in good standing in each
other jurisdiction where its ownership or lease of property or the conduct of

information provided or made available, or statements made, to Purchaser or
its Affiliates or Related Persons (or any omissions therefrom).

  

Section 6.9 _ **Warranties Exclusive**_. Purchaser acknowledges that
the representations and warranties contained in Article V are the only
representations or warranties given by Sellers and that all other express or

Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement which is
assumed by Purchaser as described under this Section 7.7 will be governed by
the terms of such assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement, subject to any
modifications of  benefits as referenced in this Section 7.7; _provided_
that, and notwithstanding any of the foregoing, if any Transferred Employees
were covered immediately prior to the Closing Date by a Collective Bargaining
Agreement which is not assumed by Purchaser as described under this Section
7.7, Purchaser shall retain the right, at its sole discretion, to set the
initial terms of employment of such Transferred Employees subject to  and in
accordance with applicable Laws.

  

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and to the extent that
Sellers have any personnel to do so, from time to time following the Closing,
Sellers shall make available to Purchaser such non-confidential data in
personnel records of Transferred Employees as is reasonably necessary for
Purchaser to transition such Transferred Employees  into Purchaser\'s
records.

  

(c) Purchaser shall assume all accrued, but unused, vacation of
Transferred Employees as an Assumed Liability. To the extent that service is
relevant for purposes of eligibility and vesting (and, in order to calculate
the amount of any vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits)
under any benefit plan of Purchaser or  its Affiliates or where required to
by applicable Law, Purchaser shall credit (or cause to be credited)
Transferred Employees for service earned prior to the Closing with Sellers or
any of their respective predecessors in addition to service earned with
Purchaser on and after the Closing.

  

(d) To the extent the Transferred Employees and their dependents enroll
in any welfare benefit plan sponsored by Purchaser or its Affiliates,
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to waive, or cause such waiver of,
any preexisting condition limitation applicable to such Transferred Employees
to the extent that the Transferred Employee\'s  or dependent\'s condition
would not have operated as a preexisting condition under the applicable
welfare benefit plan maintained by Sellers. In addition, Purchaser shalluse
reasonable best efforts to, or cause any applicable subsidiary or Affiliate to
(i) waive all waiting periods otherwise applicable to the Transferred
Employees and their dependents, other than waiting periods that are in effect
with respect to such individuals as of the Closing to the extent not satisfied
under  the corresponding benefit plans of Sellers and (ii) provide each
Transferred Employee and his or her dependents with corresponding credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid by them under the corresponding Benefit
Plans during the portion of the respective plan year prior to the Closing.

  

(e) To the extent Sellers\' 401(k) plan/tax-qualified "cash or deferred
arrangement" is not a Transferred Benefit Plan, following the Closing and
pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the IRC, Purchaser shall permit its tax-
qualified defined contribution plan to accept rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions"  (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the IRC) in cash in an amount up to the full account balance distributed to
a Transferred Employee from Sellers\' tax-qualified defined contribution plan.
For purpose of this _Section_7.7(e)_ , the term "eligible rollover
distribution" shall include (i) the amount of any unpaid balance of any loan
made to a Transferred Employee under

  



  

 

  

53   



  

 

  



  

Sellers\' tax-qualified defined contribution plan and (ii) the promissory note
evidencing such loan. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event of a breach of _Section_5.12(b)(ii)_ , Purchaser shall
not be required to accept eligible rollover distributions (or purported
eligible rollover distributions) from any of the  Sellers 401(k) plans/tax-
qualified "cash or deferred arrangements," and as such, Purchaser shall not be
deemed to be in breach of _Section_7.7(e)_ hereof for failing to accept such
rollover distributions.

  

(f) Purchaser shall be responsible for satisfying obligations under
Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA and Section 4980B of the IRC, to provide
continuation coverage to or with respect to any Transferred Employee (and
eligible dependents) with respect to any "qualifying event" which  occurs
after the Closing, and for any Employee with respect to the Purchased Assets
(or such spouse or dependent of any Transferred Employee) who is an "MandA
qualified beneficiary," as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation
54.4980B-9, QandA 4 _et seq_. or such other applicable Laws. With respect to
each such "MandA qualified beneficiary" Sellers shall: (1) provide written
notice to Purchaser within ten (10) days prior to  date of termination of
each of Sellers\' group health plans of which any such "MandA qualified
beneficiary" is eligible to receive continuation coverage under Section 601
_et seq._ of ERISA and Section 4980B of the IRC, and (2) provide such other
information related to the "MandA qualified beneficiaries" within five (5) days
of a request from Purchaser to enable Purchaser to properly satisfy any
notification  requirements with respect to these individuals.

  

(g) All provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee
benefit plans or compensation of Transferred Employees are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties hereto. Nothing contained herein (a)
shall confer upon any former, current or future employee of Sellers, Purchased
Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any  legal representative or beneficiary thereof
any rights or remedies, including, without limitation, any right to employment
or continued employment, of any nature, for any specified period, (b) shall
cause the employment status of any former, present or future employee of
Purchaser to be other than terminable at will or (c) shall confer any third
party beneficiary rights upon any Transferred Employee or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof or any heirs or assigns  thereof.

(i) Any Liability or obligation that Sellers may incur with respect to
severance benefits, OSHA exposure or termination of employees of Sellers
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date will be an Excluded Liability,
except as provided by applicable Laws or this Agreement.

  

(j) Except as contemplated by _Section 7.7(f)_ hereof and except with
respect to Transferred Benefit Plans and any Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser
will not be liable for any post-retirement welfare benefits required to be
provided with respect to service performed for Sellers or their  Affiliates
or any of their Affiliates prior to the Closing Date with respect to: (i) all
Transferred Employees, (ii) all employees of Sellers or their Affiliates who
do not become Transferred Employees and (iii) all former employees of the
Sellers or their Affiliates and, in each case, all of their eligible
dependents.

  

(k) Subject to agreement by each of the unions that are parties to the
Collective Bargaining Agreements, and subject to the provisions of _Section
7.7(l)_ , Purchaser or its Affiliate may assume and continue in full force and
effect the Collective Bargaining Agreements effective as of the  Closing
Date; _provided, however_ , that no Benefit Plans, other than Transferred
Benefit Plans, shall be assumed. Purchaser or its Affiliate may substitute
insurance carriers or providers to administer and/or deliver the benefits to
Transferred Employees who are covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements,
_provided_ that those benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate 
to those benefits that would have been required under the Collective
Bargaining Agreements. Purchaser or its Affiliate continuing the

  



  

 

  

54   



  

 

  



  

Collective Bargaining Agreements will have sole responsibility for all
obligations and liabilities arising under the assumed Collective Bargaining
Agreements, save and except for the Benefit Plans that Purchaser is not
assuming.

  

(l) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain from each union that is a party to a Collective Bargaining
Agreement the union\'s written acknowledgement, understanding and agreement,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, that if Sellers sell
their assets as contemplated by  this Agreement and Purchaser assumes such
Collective Bargaining Agreement, such Collective Bargaining Agreement may be
amended such that Purchaser or its Affiliate, at its respective election, may
substitute its own benefits for the existing benefits provided under such
Collective Bargaining Agreement, including providing a defined contribution
plan rather than a defined benefit pension plan, if applicable; _provided_
that those  benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
which exist under such Collective Bargaining Agreement as of the date hereof,
except that Purchaser or its Affiliate may provide a defined contribution plan
rather than a defined benefit pension plan, if applicable. With respect to any
Collective Bargaining Agreement, if no such written acknowledgment or
understanding is obtained, unless otherwise notified by Purchaser, such
Collective Bargaining Agreement shall not be  a Purchased Contract and
Purchaser will retain its lawful right to set the initial terms of employment
of those Transferred Employees who were covered by such Collective Bargaining
Agreement immediately prior to the Closing Date.

  

(m) No provision of this _Section 7.7_ will create any third party
beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary, dependent or alternate payee thereof ) of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with 
either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and no provision of this _Section
7.7_ will create any such rights to any such Persons in respect of any
benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Benefit Plan,
or any plan or arrangement which may be established by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

  

(n) At any time and from time to time after the date hereof, Purchaser
shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions necessary to effectuate
the foregoing as set forth in this _Section 7.7_ , including, without
limitation, taking all action necessary to assume and adopt each Transferred 
Benefit Plan effective as of the Closing. Sellers will reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser and take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions as the
Purchaser may reasonably request in order to effectuate the foregoing.

  

(o) To the extent that the Mexican Assets are purchased pursuant to the
Mexican APA, the Mexican APA shall designate which employees of the Purchased
Subsidiaries shall be hired by the purchaser of the Mexican Assets and which
Liabilities of the Purchased Subsidiaries, including employee benefit plans,
shall be assumed by the purchaser of the  Mexican Assets. The Mexican APA
shall also designate which Mexican Collective Bargaining Agreements, if any,
shall be assumed by Purchaser in connection with the Mexican APA, and the
extent of any such assumption.

(a) Purchaser and Sellers shall, and Sellers shall cause the Purchased
Subsidiaries to negotiate in good faith and enter into one or more separate
asset purchase agreements (the " **Mexican APA** ") with respect to the
Sellers\' assets, including those of the Purchased Subsidiaries, located in 
Mexico (the " **Mexican Assets** ") and any reasonably required Real Estate
transfer documents, pursuant to which,

  



  

 

  

55   



  

 

  



  

among other things, the Purchased Subsidiaries shall assign, to the extent
permitted under Mexican law, all Consents required by the Mexican Governmental
Authorities to operate the business of the Purchased Subsidiaries and assign
all Contracts to which the Purchased Subsidiaries are a party (together with
the Mexican APA, the " **Mexican Transfer  Documents** ") on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Sellers. If the necessary
Consents with respect to the transfer and operation of the Mexican Assets to
Purchaser pursuant to the Mexican Transfer Documents cannot, in the opinion of
Purchaser, be obtained or assigned, as the case may be, on or prior to the
Closing Date, or the Contracts cannot, in the opinion of Purchaser, be
assigned as of the Closing Date, so long as all other  conditions in Article
IX are satisfied or anticipated to be satisfied at the Closing, (i) Purchaser
and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith a service agreement (the " **Mexican
Service Agreement** "), effective as of the Closing Date, pursuant to which,
until the Consents necessary to operate the Mexican Assets and to effectuate
the transfer of the Mexican Assets to Purchaser are obtained, and the
Contracts are assigned, the Purchased  Subsidiaries shall provide, or cause
to be provided, services to Purchaser such that Purchaser shall receive the
same benefits, and be no materially worse off with respect to the Mexican
Assets, as if the Mexican Assets had been transferred to Purchaser at the
Closing pursuant to the Mexican Transfer Documents; and (ii) the Purchased
Subsidiaries shall grant to the individuals appointed by Purchaser, the
necessary powers of attorney and assistance in order to transfer and/or
assign  the Consents and Contracts.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Sellers and Purchaser agree,
including without limitation, on the specific steps that must be taken to
implement such transfer, instead of entering into the Mexican Transfer
Documents, at the Closing Sellers shall transfer to Purchaser the Equity
Securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries pursuant to this  Agreement.

  

(c) The amount of the Purchase Price allocated for Mexican Tax purposes
to the Mexican Assets or the Equity Securities of the Purchased Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, will be determined in accordance with Mexican GAAP and
Mexican valuation procedures.

and (iii) if the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Authority issues a "second request" for information under

10.1(c)_.

  

(e) If required pursuant to applicable provisions of the Federal

Upon the occurrence of the events set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) or

Purchaser upon the consummation of such Alternative  Transaction or
Restructuring Transaction, as applicable.

  

Any obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee and/or Reimbursable Expenses hereunder
shall be absolute and unconditional; such payment shall constitute an
administrative expense of Sellers\' estates under sections 503(b)(1)(A) and
507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be payable as specified herein, and
not subject to any defense, claim, counterclaim, offset, recoupment, or

to  _Section 10.1(b)_ all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.1_ and
_9.2_ have been satisfied and continue to be satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), then the
Deposit Amount shall be payable to Sellers. Sellers agree (i) that
Purchaser\'s aggregate Liability for money damages in such  circumstances
shall be limited to the Deposit Amount and (ii) the Deposit Amount constitutes
the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers, whether at Law or in equity, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated under such circumstances, except in
the event of Purchaser\'s fraud or willful breach. Sellers and Purchaser agree
that the Deposit Amount was a material inducement to Sellers to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
shall be  payable as specified herein and not subject to any defense, claim,
counterclaim, offset, recoupment, or reduction of any kind whatsoever.

  

(d) Except as set forth above in this _Section 10.2_ , all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not
the Sale is consummated.

**ARTICLE XII**

  

**MISCELLANEOUS**

  

Section 12.1 _ **Governing Law**_ **.** This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Bankruptcy Code and, to the extent
not inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code, the laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to conflicts of law principles  thereof.

  

Section 12.2 _ **Jurisdiction; Forum; Service of Process; Waiver of
Jury**_. With respect to any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, each of Sellers and Purchaser hereby irrevocably:

  

(a) consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, as
the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any matters arising under or
in connection with the Agreement. After Sellers are no longer subject to the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, each of Sellers and Purchaser
irrevocably submits to the exclusive  jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York and of the United States of America, in each case located in
Manhattan, (" **Selected Courts** ") for any Action arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (and agrees not to commence any Action
relating hereto or thereto except in such courts) and waives any objection to
venue being laid in the  Selected Courts whether based on the grounds of
forum non conveniens or otherwise;

  

(b) consents to service of process in any Action by the mailing of
copies thereof by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, or by
recognized international express carrier or delivery service, to Sellers or
Purchaser at their respective addresses referred to in _Section 12.5_
hereof;  provided, however, that nothing herein shall affect the right of any
party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by law, and

  

(c) WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS.

  

Section 12.3 _ **Successors and Assigns**_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
upon, the successors by operation of law and permitted assigns of the parties
hereto. No assignment of this Agreement may be made by any party at any 
time, whether or not by operation of law, without the other party\'s prior
written consent; provided, however, that Purchaser may, without the consent of
the other parties hereto, assign any of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to one or more Affiliate(s) of Purchaser, which
assignment, in either case, will not relieve Purchaser of any obligations
hereunder. Except as specifically provided for herein, only the parties to
this Agreement or their permitted  assigns shall have rights under this
Agreement.

  

Section 12.4 _ **Entire Agreement; Amendment**_. This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the
full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to
the subjects hereof and supersede all prior agreements relating to the
subject  matter hereof. Except as expressly provided herein, neither this
Agreement nor any term hereof may be amended, modified, supplemented, waived,
discharged or terminated other than by a written instrument signed by Sellers
and Purchaser expressly stating that such instrument is intended to amend,
modify, supplement, waive, discharge or terminate this Agreement or such term
hereof. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of  any other provision hereof (whether or
not similar).

Section 12.6 _ **Delays or Omissions**_. Except as expressly provided
herein, no delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing
to Sellers or Purchaser upon any breach or default of any party under this
Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of Sellers or
Purchaser  nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or
default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default
thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be
deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter
occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on
the part of Sellers or Purchaser of any breach or default under this
Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any  such party of any provisions or
conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only
to the extent specifically set forth in such writing. All remedies, either
under this Agreement or by law, in equity, or otherwise afforded to Sellers or
Purchaser shall be cumulative and not alternative.

  

Section 12.7 _ **Counterparts**_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

Section 12.8 _ **Severability**_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect without said provisions;  _provided_ that no such severability
shall be effective if it materially changes the economic benefit of this
Agreement to any party. Any provision held invalid or unenforceable only in
part or degree will remain in full force to the extent not held invalid or
unenforceable.

  

Section 12.9 _ **Titles and Subtitles**_. The titles and subtitles used
in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered
in construing or interpreting this Agreement.

  

Section 12.10 _ **No Public Announcement**_. Absent the prior written
consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall make any press
release, public announcement or securities filing with any Governmental
Authority concerning the  transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be obligated
to make any such disclosure by this Agreement or by applicable Law, and then
only after giving the other party hereto adequate time to review such
disclosure and consider in good faith the comments of the other party hereto
and consultation as to such comments with such party as to the content of such
disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein  or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties hereto and each of their respective
employees, representatives or other agents, are permitted to disclose to any
and all Persons, without limitations of any kind, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transactions and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to such parties
related to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided, however, that the
foregoing permission  to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure does
not permit the disclosure of any information that is not relevant to
understanding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions
(including the identity of any party and the amounts paid in connection with
the transactions); provided, further, however, that the tax treatment and tax
structure shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with
federal or state securities laws.

reference shall be to such agreement, instrument or statute as at that
particular date. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors
and assigns.

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly

Agreement and the terms of the Approval Order or the Sale Order, this
Agreement shall control.
