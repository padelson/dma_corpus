TRANSACTION AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF AMALGAMATION   

 TRANSACTION AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF AMALGAMATION, dated as of October 27, 2003 (this "Agreement"), by and among HSBC Holdings plc, a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales ("Parent"), The Bank of Bermuda Limited, a body corporate incorporated under the laws of Bermuda (the "Company") and Somers Investment Company Limited, a body corporate incorporated under the laws of Bermuda ("Amalgamation Sub").   

 WHEREAS, Amalgamation Sub is a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.11(a)) of HSBC Asia Holdings B.V., a company organized under the laws of the Netherlands ("Intermediate Holding Sub"), and Intermediate Holding Sub is an indirect, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent;   

 WHEREAS, it is proposed that the Company and Amalgamation Sub amalgamate (the "Amalgamation") and continue as one company (the "Amalgamated Company") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and an amalgamation agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1 (the "Amalgamation Agreement"), and in accordance with the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the "Companies Act");   

 WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent, Intermediate Holding Sub, Amalgamation Sub and the Company have each approved the Amalgamation upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Amalgamation Agreement;   

 WHEREAS, the parties contemplate that the Company will declare a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") of BD$5.00 per outstanding common share of the Company, par value BD$1.00 per share ("Company Shares") to shareholders of record as of the close of business on the day prior to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) and payable by the Amalgamated Company 10 business days thereafter;   

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby;   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I   

THE AMALGAMATION   

 1.1 _The Amalgamation_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Amalgamation Agreement, and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Companies Act, at the Effective Time, Amalgamation Sub and the Company shall amalgamate and the Company and Amalgamation Sub shall continue as one company as a result of the Amalgamation.    ##### 

    

 1.2 _Closing Date_. The closing of the transactions provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall be held at the Companys headquarters in Hamilton, Bermuda, at 10:00 A.M., local time, on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to be satisfied or waived of the conditions (other than the delivery of certificates pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3) set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 or at such other place and on such other date as shall be agreed to by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date."   

 1.3 _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable following Closing on the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Amalgamation to be consummated by filing the memorandum of association of the Amalgamated Company and all other required documents with the Bermuda Registrar of Companies, in accordance with Section 108 of the Companies Act. The term "Effective Time" means the date and time that the Amalgamation shall be effective pursuant to the Companies Act.   

 1.4 _Deliveries at Closing_. Subject to the provisions of Article VII, on the Closing Date there shall be delivered to Parent and the Company the officers certificates required pursuant to Sections 7.2 and 7.3.   

 1.5 _Effect of the Amalgamation_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Amalgamation shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the Companies Act.   

 1.6 _Consideration_. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of Amalgamation Sub, the Company or the holders of Company Shares, and subject to applicable Bermuda law:   

 (a) Except as specified in Section 1.6(b) and 1.6(c) below, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive in cash U.S.$40.00 per Company Share (without interest, subject to applicable withholding for taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges) (the "Amalgamation Consideration"). At the Effective Time all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration as provided herein. Nothing in this section shall affect the right of any holder of Company Shares as of the record date for the Special Dividend to receive the Special Dividend.   

 (b) Each Company Share (if any) (i) owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Company Shares held for the account or benefit of any customer, client or other Person (as defined in Section 9.11(a))) or (ii) held in trust for use in Company Share Option Plans (as defined in Section 1.8(a)) or Company Share Purchase Plans (as defined in Section 1.8(c)) (other than Company Shares actually used to satisfy the Companys obligations to deliver Company Shares under such plans at or prior to the Effective Time including the delivery of Company Shares previously purchased pursuant to Company Share Purchase Plans) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration    

2

and shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.  

 (c) Each Company Share held by a dissenting shareholder for the purposes of Section 106 of the Companies Act (a "Dissenting Shareholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration, and shall be cancelled and converted into a right to receive payment of fair value pursuant to and subject to Section 106 of the Companies Act; provided that if a Dissenting Shareholder withdraws such claim, such holders right to receive payment of fair value shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6(a). The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of the existence of any Dissenting Shareholders, attempted withdrawals of applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the shares and any other instruments served pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholders rights to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholders Company Shares, as provided in Section 106 of the Companies Act; and (b) the opportunity to direct any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Shares, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.   

 (d) The common shares of Amalgamation Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable common shares of the Amalgamated Company equal to the number of Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.   

 1.7 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment of Consideration_    

 (a) Parent will cause Intermediate Holding Sub, from time to time after the Effective Time, to make available to a bank or trust company agreed by Parent and the Company (the "Paying Agent") sufficient funds to make the payments due pursuant to Section 1.6(a) on a timely basis to holders of Company Shares that are converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). Parent will cause Intermediate Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. Parent will cause Intermediate Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent to have available an office in Hamilton, Bermuda (which may be at the Companys main office) to facilitate payment of the Amalgamation Consideration in Bermuda.   

 (b) Parent acknowledges that the Company may cause the Paying Agent to mail, no later than 10 days prior to the Effective Time, to Bermuda resident holders of record of Company Shares immediately prior to such mailing a form (a "Brokerage Notice"), permitting the holder to deliver a notice of such holders request (a "Request") to have the Paying Agent, in the event the Amalgamation is consummated, deliver to Le Masurier, James and Chinn (or, if Le Masurier, James and Chinn is unavailable or unwilling to serve as broker, a broker selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent) the Amalgamation Consideration to which they    ##### 

    

will have become entitled so that such holder may, in such holders
sole discretion, subsequently use any or all of such funds to purchase
ordinary shares in the capital of Parent for a period of 30 days following
the Closing, without the payment of any brokerage fees by such holder. Such
mailing may, if agreed by Parent and the Company, accompany the Shareholder
Materials (as defined in Section 6.1(a)). The Brokerage Notice shall be on
terms reasonably satisfactory to Parent and shall require such procedures as
are necessary in order for such payment to be deposited and such purchase to
be made, including, without limitation, the surrender of Certificates (as
defined in Section 1.7(c)) (or other procedures for book stock) and
certification that such holder is a Bermuda resident.  

 (c) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Intermediate Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of Company Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than such holders who already made a valid Request pursuant to Section 1.7(b) above) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") which sets forth the procedures by which holders of share certificates, which prior to the Effective Time represented Company Shares (the "Certificates"), and the holders of book shares, which are uncertificated, may receive the Amalgamation Consideration. Upon a holder complying with such procedures (but in no event prior to the Effective Time), the Paying Agent will deliver to such holders cash in an amount (without interest, subject to applicable withholding for taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges) equal to the number of Company Shares owned by such person immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Amalgamation Consideration. All such Certificates shall forthwith be cancelled and book accounts shall be cancelled. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered or book account is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that all documentation for a book account transfer is received and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder or establish to the satisfaction of the Amalgamated Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.7(c), each Certificate and each book account shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Amalgamation Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Company Shares evidenced by such Certificate or book account, without any interest thereon.   

 (d) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making on an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Amalgamated Company, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Amalgamated Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Amalgamation Consideration with respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby.   

 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Amalgamated Company. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not complied with Section 1.7(c) prior to the end of such six-month period    ##### 

    

shall thereafter look only to the Amalgamated Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their claim for the
Amalgamation Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent,
Intermediate Holding Sub nor the Amalgamated Company shall be liable to any
holder of Company Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund
or otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificates (or book shares) shall
not have been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or
such earlier date as shall be immediately prior to the date that such
unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar law), unclaimed funds payable with respect to such
Certificates (or book shares) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Amalgamated Company, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.  

 1.8 _Share Options; Equity Plans_.   

 (a) Company Share Option Plans. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company (or, if appropriate, the board of directors of the Company or Parent or any committee of the board of directors of the Company administering the Companys Executive Share Option Plan, Share Option Plan 2000, and 1999 Director Share Option Plan, each as amended (collectively, the "Company Share Option Plans")) shall take such action as may be required or desirable (including obtaining all applicable consents) to effect the following provisions of this Section 1.8(a). The board of directors of the Company or the applicable committee may exercise its powers under the Company Share Option Plans to accelerate, as of a date prior to the Effective Time as agreed by the Company and Parent, exerciseability of all outstanding Company Share Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to acquire Company Shares (each, a "Company Share Option") granted pursuant to the Company Share Option Plans or otherwise granted by the Company to any current or former employee or director of, or consultant to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Option Holder") shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (an "Assumed Share Option") to purchase a number of Parent ordinary shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) (so that there is no continuing right to acquire Company Shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section 9.11(a)); and the per share exercise price for Parent ordinary shares transferable upon exercise of such Assumed Share Option (rounded to the nearest whole cent) shall be equal to (A) the excess of (i) the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Share Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time over (ii) the Special Dividend divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any Company Share Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. The Assumed Share Option shall be exercisable immediately and shall otherwise in all material respects be subject to the same terms as were applicable to the corresponding Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain prior to the Effective Time the consent of all Option Holders to the foregoing treatment of the options.    ##### 

    

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Option Holders appropriate notices setting forth the number of Parent ordinary shares subject to such Assumed Share Options held by each such Option Holder and the exercise price under each such Assumed Share Option, each as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.8(a) hereof, and stating that such Assumed Share Options shall be subject to the original conditions (and no other conditions) applicable to the corresponding Company Share Options as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments required and changes permitted by Section 1.8(a)).   

 (c) Company Share Purchase Plans. The Company shall take such action as is necessary to (i) cause the acquisition (prior to the record date for the Special Dividend) by participants of all Company Shares to which they are entitled under either the Companys Third Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "Third Plan") or the Companys Executive Share Plan (together with the Third Plan, the "Company Share Purchase Plans"), subject always to the right of a participant under rule 13 of the Third Plan to receive a cash refund equal to the amount of the installments deducted from such participants salary for the purposes of the Third Plan for the current Plan Year (as defined therein), together with any accumulated interest thereon; and (ii) provide that no further purchase period shall commence under the Third Plan following such date; provided, however, that such cessation of further purchases shall be of no further force and effect if this Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the Amalgamation. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Amalgamation, the Company shall terminate the Company Share Purchase Plans.   

 (d) Securities Registration. If required, Parent shall, promptly following the Effective Time, use reasonable endeavours to prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") with respect to the issuance of the Parent ordinary shares subject to the Assumed Share Options.   

 (e) Necessary Actions; Transfer of Authorities. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or appropriate action (including amending any of the Company Share Option Plans or the Company Share Purchase Plans and related award agreements or making adjustments as permitted thereby) to effectuate all necessary or appropriate transactions contemplated or required in this Section 1.8 and the assignment to Parent of the authorities and responsibilities of the board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to the Company Share Option Plans and the Company Share Purchase Plans.

has had or would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section
9.11(a)) with respect to the Company or Parent, as the case may be.

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of their respective customers, violate Company policy with respect to client confidentiality, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, but shall disclose the nature of all such withheld information. The parties hereto will, to the extent practicable, make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 6.4 _Board Recommendation._ The Companys board of directors has adopted a resolution recommending approval of the Amalgamation and the Amalgamation Agreement by the Companys shareholders and, except as provided in the next sentence, the board of directors of the Company shall at all times recommend approval of the Amalgamation and the Amalgamation Agreement by the Companys shareholders. The board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent and Amalgamation Sub (or not to continue to make) its recommendation to its shareholders if, but only if, (a) it reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, (b) the Company has given Parent five business days prior notice of its intention to withdraw or modify such recommendation and the Companys board of directors has considered any proposed changes (if any) to this Agreement and/or the Amalgamation Agreement proposed by Parent and (c) the Company has fully and completely complied with Section 6.5.   

 6.5 _Other Offers._ The Company and its Subsidiaries, and the officers, directors, employees, financial or legal advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, will not, directly or indirectly, (a) take any action to solicit, initiate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or (b) engage in negotiations with, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company may, in response to an unsolicited written proposal from a third party regarding an Acquisition Proposal, engage in the activities specified in clause (b) of this Section 6.5, if (i) the board of directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and (ii) the Company has received from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated as of April 6, 2003 between the Company and Parent. The Company will immediately notify Parent orally and will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after the relevant event) notify Parent in writing (which oral and written notices shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or request for information and set forth the material terms thereof) after having received any Acquisition Proposal, or request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person who is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep Parent fully and currently informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or request and any related discussions or negotiations. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and directors, officers, employees and financial and legal advisors to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from taking and disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a third party to the extent required by applicable law or from making such disclosure to the shareholders of the Company which, in the judgment of the outside counsel of the Company, is required under applicable law; provided that nothing in this sentence shall affect the obligations of the Company and its board of directors under any other provision of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or  ##### 

    

proposal for, or any indication of interest in (w) an amalgamation, scheme of
arrangement, merger or consolidation, or any similar transaction,

or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the
assets or deposits of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (y) a purchase
or other acquisition (including by way of an amalgamation, scheme of
arrangement, merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of
beneficial ownership of securities representing 10% or more of the voting
power of the Company or 25% or more of the voting power of any Subsidiary of
the Company, or (z) any substantially similar transaction.  

 6.6 _Shareholder Approval_. The Company will take all action reasonably necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Company Shares (the "Company Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining the approval of the Amalgamation and the Amalgamation Agreement required by Section 106 of the Companies Act (the "Company Shareholder Approval"). In the event that a quorum is not present at the Company Meeting, the Company shall, from time to time as requested by Parent, adjourn the Company Meeting to a later date so that a quorum may be achieved. The Companys obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be affected by any determination of the Companys board of directors not to recommend the Amalgamation or to no longer recommend it or deem it advisable. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and the terms of this Agreement (including Section 6.4), the board of directors of the Company shall recommend to its shareholders the approval of the Amalgamation and the Amalgamation Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and shall use reasonable endeavours to solicit such approval (including the solicitation of proxies).   

 6.7 _Reasonable Endeavours_. Subject to Section 6.4, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable endeavours (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal or regulatory requirements which may be imposed on such party, the Amalgamated Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to the Amalgamation and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party (including, in the case of the Company, obtaining any required consent in respect of a Company Contract) which is required to be obtained by the Company or Parent, the Amalgamated Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Amalgamation; provided that none of Parent, Amalgamation Sub nor Intermediate Holding Sub shall be obligated to agree to, in the case of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this Agreement, "Burdensome Condition" means any conditions, restrictions or requirements which the board of directors of Parent reasonably determines would, individually or in the aggregate, (A) reduce the benefits of the Amalgamation to such a degree that Parent would not have entered into this Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the date hereof or (B) have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material and adverse effect on the Company or the Amalgamated Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Effective Time, including as Previously Disclosed.  ##### 

    

 6.8 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) The bye-laws of the Amalgamated Company shall contain, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the provisions with respect to limitation of liability and indemnification set forth in the Company Bye-laws on the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties (as defined below) in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, actions or omissions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby); provided that the bye-laws of the Amalgamated Company shall not be required to contain such provisions if not permitted by applicable law or if Parent otherwise provides the same level of indemnification rights to such individuals as contained in the bye-laws of the Amalgamated Company.   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to (A) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent that would be permitted by Bermuda law if given by the Amalgamated Company in relation to its own present and former officers and directors, the present and former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacities as such (each an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, expenses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Losses") arising out of actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, actions or omissions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby), and (B) (without duplication) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the present officers and directors of the Company in their capacities as such, to the fullest extent that the Amalgamated Company would be permitted to indemnify such officer or director under English Law if the Amalgamated Company were an English public limited company and such indemnity were given by it in relation to its own officers and directors, against all Losses pertaining to this Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and all actions taken by such officer or director in connection herewith, other than Losses arising from matters not known to Parent prior to the date hereof with respect to this Agreement or such transactions or action.   

 (c) Parent shall use its reasonable endeavours to cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that Parent may substitute therefore policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are (i) not less advantageous than such policy or (ii) approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Amalgamated Company who were members of the board of directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, actions or omissions relating to the transactions contemplated hereby) which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent or its Subsidiaries be required to expend an aggregate of more than 200% of the current annual amount expended by the Company (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; provided, further, that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.8(c), Parent shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Insurance Amount.    ##### 

    

 (d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 6.9 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Amalgamated Company will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Amalgamation Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Amalgamation Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Amalgamated Company any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Amalgamated Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Amalgamation.   

 6.10 _Advice of Changes_. Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other of any change or event having, or which could have, a Material Adverse Effect on it or them, as applicable, or which would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions in Article VII not to be satisfied or to cause the satisfaction thereof to be materially delayed.   

 6.11  _Employee Benefits_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause  the Amalgamated Company to, recognize prior service recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that continues to be employed by the Amalgamated Company following the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") as service under the employee benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals) in which such Company Employee is eligible to participate following the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any applicable group health plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries to be waived with respect to applicable Company Employees to the extent that such Company Employees were covered or would have been covered under the group health plans of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) give each Company Employee credit, for the plan year in which such Company Employee commences participation in the plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries, towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the commencement of participation. Parent shall maintain employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (excluding equity-based plans and similar arrangements) for Company Employees following the Effective Time which provide benefits that continue to maintain the Companys market position vis a vis benefits in Bermuda and which are not, in the aggregate, inconsistent with the Companys prior general approach to employee benefits; provided that the foregoing shall not    

32      

* * *

 

##### 

  

apply to Company Employees who are transferred to Parent or one of Parents
Subsidiaries (other than the Amalgamated Company and its Subsidiaries).
Parent will continue in place the Companys past practices with respect to
retired employee medical benefits, to the extent Previously Disclosed.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be applied to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits or be interpreted to require Parent to provide
employment to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or provide for participation of any Company Employee in any employee
benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements of Parent. Notwithstanding
any other provision herein, none of Parent, the Amalgamated Company nor any
of their Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue the employment of
any Company Employee for any period following the Effective Time. Parent
agrees to perform, or cause to be performed, those actions which are referred
to as Parent having told the Company it will take in employment agreements
being entered into with certain Company executives simultaneously
herewith.  

 6.12 _Board of Directors of Amalgamated Company_. Parent shall have the right to designate the members of the board of directors of the Amalgamated Company, which members shall be specified in the Amalgamation Agreement. Parent shall designate, subject to their willingness to act, the members of the board of directors of the Company as of the date hereof and up to two additional directors, as nominated by Parent, to serve as the initial board of directors of the Amalgamated Company. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use reasonable endeavours to ensure that such designees may be validly appointed to the board of directors of the Amalgamated Company as of the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall prejudice Parents right to require changes to the board of directors of the Amalgamated Company after the Effective Time.   

 6.13 _Bermuda_. Parent confirms its statements made to the board of directors of the Company that it: (a) will cause the Amalgamated Company to continue to use for at least five years following the Effective Time the name "The Bank of Bermuda Limited", used as appropriate with Parents logo; (b) concurs with the continued support, at current levels as Previously Disclosed by the Company, by the Amalgamated Company of the Bank of Bermuda Foundation and the Companys local sponsorship of events and (c) will, promptly following the Effective Time, apply for a secondary listing on the Bermuda Stock Exchange for Parent ordinary shares.   

 6.14 _DRIP_. Simultaneously with the execution hereof, the board of directors of the Company has suspended the operation of the DRIP and the DRIP shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 (c) _Approvals._ All third party approvals (other than the Requisite Regulatory Approvals) that are necessary for the conduct, immediately following the Effective Time, by the Amalgamated Company of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,    #####

ARTICLE VIII   

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 (a) by mutual consent of Parent and the Company in a written instrument executed and delivered in accordance with their respective applicable laws;   

 (b) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Entity which must grant or satisfy, as the case may be, a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Amalgamation and such denial has become final and nonappealable, or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable Injunction permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;   

 (c) by either Parent or the Company if the Amalgamation shall not have been consummated on or before April 30, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;   

 (d) by either Parent or the Company if there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company (in the case of Parent) or Parent (in the case of the Company), which breach (other than a breach of Section 6.4) is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the date referred to in Section 8.1(c); provided that such breach, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, would constitute, individually or in the aggregate with other such breaches, the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b), 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as applicable;

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.   

 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to compliance with applicable law, Parent and the Company may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto for its benefit, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties for its benefit contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the waiving partys benefit. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 9.3 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this    ##### 

    

Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to require the
Company, Parent or any of their respective directors, Subsidiaries or
affiliates to take any action which would violate any applicable law
(including any bank secrecy law), rule or regulation. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, neither Parent, on the one hand, nor the
Company, on the other, shall be deemed to have failed to comply with any of
its obligations hereunder (other than the giving of notice contemplated by
Section 8.1(d)) to the extent such failure is due to a breach (subject to the
standard set forth in Section 2.2) by the other party of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein.  

 9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.   

 9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Amalgamation Agreement, the exhibits attached hereto and all other documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other than the provisions relating to confidentiality contained in the Confidentiality Agreements.   

 9.6 _Governing Law_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.   

 (b) If any party has a claim against another party arising out of or in connection with this Agreement such claim shall be referred to the High Court of Justice in England, to the jurisdiction of which each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably submits. The jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice in England over any such claim shall be an exclusive jurisdiction and no courts outside England shall have any jurisdiction to hear and determine any such claim. Amalgamation Sub hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints Parent to accept service of all legal process arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. The Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints The Law Debenture Trust, Fifth Floor, 100 Wood Street, London EC2V 7EX to accept service of all legal process arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.   

 9.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.    ##### 

    

 9.8 _Publicity_. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall either of them permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement concerning, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and, in any event, only after consultation with the other parties to the extent feasible; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 9.8 shall prevent either party or their respective Subsidiaries from issuing or causing the publication of any press release or other public announcement, or otherwise making a public statement, in accordance with the requirements of applicable law or the rules and regulations of any Regulatory Agency.   

 9.9 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.8, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, and a Person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.
