converted into the right to receive in cash U.S.$40.00 per Company Share
(without interest, subject to applicable withholding for taxes, levies, imposts
or other governmental charges) (the &#147;Amalgamation Consideration&#148;). At the
Effective Time all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such
Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration as provided herein. Nothing in
this section shall affect the right of any holder of Company Shares as of the

pursuant to and subject to Section&nbsp;106 of the Companies Act; provided that if a
Dissenting Shareholder withdraws such claim, such holder&#146;s right to receive
payment of fair value shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into a right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration in
accordance with Section&nbsp;1.6(a). The Company shall give Parent (a)&nbsp;prompt notice
of the existence of any Dissenting Shareholders, attempted withdrawals of
applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of
the shares and any other instruments served pursuant to the Companies Act and
received by the Company relating to any Dissenting Shareholder&#146;s rights to be

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Parent will cause Intermediate Holding Sub, from time to time after
the Effective Time, to make available to a bank or trust company agreed by
Parent and the Company (the &#147;Paying Agent&#148;) sufficient funds to make the
payments due pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.6(a) on a timely basis to holders of Company
Shares that are converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation
Consideration (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Payment
Fund&#148;). Parent will cause Intermediate Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to make the payments provided for in the
preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. Parent will cause
Intermediate Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent to have available an office
in Hamilton, Bermuda (which may be at the Company&#146;s main office) to facilitate
payment of the Amalgamation Consideration in Bermuda.

is consummated, deliver to Le Masurier, James &#038; Chinn (or, if Le Masurier,

discretion, subsequently use any or all of such funds to purchase ordinary
shares in the capital of Parent for a period of 30&nbsp;days following the Closing,
without the payment of any brokerage fees by such holder. Such mailing may, if
agreed by Parent and the Company, accompany the Shareholder Materials (as
defined in Section&nbsp;6.1(a)). The Brokerage Notice shall be on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and shall require such procedures as are necessary in
order for such payment to be deposited and such purchase to be made, including,
without limitation, the surrender of Certificates (as defined in Section
1.7(c)) (or other procedures for book stock) and certification that such holder
is a Bermuda resident.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Intermediate
Holding Sub to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of Company
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than such holders who
already made a valid Request pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.7(b) above) a letter of
transmittal (the &#147;Letter of Transmittal&#148;) which sets forth the procedures by
which holders of share certificates, which prior to the Effective Time
represented Company Shares (the &#147;Certificates&#148;), and the holders of book
shares, which are uncertificated, may receive the Amalgamation Consideration.
Upon a holder complying with such procedures (but in no event prior to the
Effective Time), the Paying Agent will deliver to such holders cash in an
amount (without interest, subject to applicable withholding for taxes, levies,
imposts or other governmental charges) equal to the number of Company Shares
owned by such person immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Amalgamation Consideration. All such Certificates shall forthwith be cancelled
and book accounts shall be cancelled. If payment is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered or book account
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that all documentation for a book account transfer is received and that the
Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or similar taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder or establish
to the satisfaction of the Amalgamated Company that such tax has been paid or
is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.7(c), each Certificate and
each book account shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive,
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Amalgamation Consideration in cash
multiplied by the number of Company Shares evidenced by such Certificate or
book account, without any interest thereon.

making on an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Amalgamated Company, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Amalgamated
Company may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Amalgamation Consideration with
respect to the Company Shares formerly represented thereby.

abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for payment of their claim

Parent, Intermediate Holding Sub nor the Amalgamated Company shall be liable to
any holder of Company Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or
otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificates (or book shares) shall not have
been surrendered prior to six years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date as shall be immediately prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would
otherwise become subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law),
unclaimed funds payable with respect to such Certificates (or book shares)

Amalgamated Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

directors of the Company or Parent or any committee of the board of directors
of the Company administering the Company&#146;s Executive Share Option Plan, Share
Option Plan 2000, and 1999 Director Share Option Plan, each as amended
(collectively, the &#147;Company Share Option Plans&#148;)) shall take such action as may
be required or desirable (including obtaining all applicable consents) to
effect the following provisions of this Section&nbsp;1.8(a). The board of directors
of the Company or the applicable committee may exercise its powers under the
Company Share Option Plans to accelerate, as of a date prior to the Effective
Time as agreed by the Company and Parent, exerciseability of all outstanding
Company Share Options. Effective as of the Effective Time, each then
outstanding option to acquire Company Shares (each, a &#147;Company Share Option&#148;)
granted pursuant to the Company Share Option Plans or otherwise granted by the
Company to any current or former employee or director of, or consultant to, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an &#147;Option Holder&#148;) shall be assumed
by Parent and shall be converted into an option (an &#147;Assumed Share Option&#148;) to
purchase a number of Parent ordinary shares (rounded to the nearest whole
share) (so that there is no continuing right to acquire Company Shares) equal
to the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of Company Shares subject to such Company
Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)&nbsp;the Option
Exchange Ratio (as defined in Section&nbsp;9.11(a)); and the per share exercise
price for Parent ordinary shares transferable upon exercise of such Assumed
Share Option (rounded to the nearest whole cent) shall be equal to (A)&nbsp;the
excess of (i)&nbsp;the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Share
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time over (ii)&nbsp;the
Special Dividend divided by (B)&nbsp;the Option Exchange Ratio; provided, however,
that in the case of any Company Share Option to which Section&nbsp;421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code, the
conversion formula shall be adjusted, if necessary, to comply with Section
424(a) of the Code. The Assumed Share Option shall be exercisable immediately
and shall otherwise in all material respects be subject to the same terms as
were applicable to the corresponding Company Share Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable endeavours to obtain
prior to the Effective Time the consent of all Option Holders to the foregoing
treatment of the options.

Holder and the exercise price under each such Assumed Share Option, each as

approval of the Amalgamation and the Amalgamation Agreement by the Company&#146;s
shareholders. The board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent and Amalgamation Sub (or not
to continue to make) its recommendation to its shareholders if, but only if,
(a)&nbsp;it reasonably determines in good faith (after due consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties, (b)&nbsp;the Company has given Parent five business days&#146; prior notice of
its intention to withdraw or modify such recommendation and the Company&#146;s board

making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal; provided that the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited written proposal from a third party regarding an
Acquisition Proposal, engage in the activities specified in clause (b)&nbsp;of this
Section&nbsp;6.5, if (i)&nbsp;the board of directors of the Company reasonably determines
in good faith (after due consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure

has received from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement with
confidentiality terms not materially less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the confidentiality agreement dated as of April&nbsp;6, 2003 between
the Company and Parent. The Company will immediately notify Parent orally and
will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after the relevant event)
notify Parent in writing (which oral and written notices shall identify the

prohibit the Company or its board of directors from taking and disclosing to

making such disclosure to the shareholders of the Company which, in the
judgment of the outside counsel of the Company, is required under applicable
law; provided that nothing in this sentence shall affect the obligations of the

Amalgamated Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Amalgamation; provided that none of Parent, Amalgamation Sub nor
Intermediate Holding Sub shall be obligated to agree to, in the case of the
Requisite Regulatory Approvals, any Burdensome Condition. For purposes of this
Agreement, &#147;Burdensome Condition&#148; means any conditions, restrictions or
requirements which the board of directors of Parent reasonably determines
would, individually or in the aggregate, (A)&nbsp;reduce the benefits of the
Amalgamation to such a degree that Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been known at the
date hereof or (B)&nbsp;have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material
and adverse effect on the Company or the Amalgamated Company and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, following the Effective Time,
including as Previously Disclosed.
