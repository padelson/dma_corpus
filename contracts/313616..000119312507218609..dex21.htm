Returns were true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has paid or caused to be paid all material Taxes in respect of the periods covered by such Tax Returns. The 2007 Financial Statements of the
Company reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with GAAP for all Tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries through the date thereof. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely withheld and paid all material Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor, shareholder or other third party. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension
of time within which to file any material Tax Return, other than for automatic extensions that do not require the affirmative consent of the taxing authority. There are no material security interests on any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax. There is no claim or dispute concerning any material Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries either (i)&nbsp;claimed or raised by any authority in writing or
(ii)&nbsp;as to which any of the directors and officers (and employees responsible for Tax matters) of the Company and its Subsidiaries has knowledge based on personal contact with any agent of such authority. No issue has been raised in writing in
any examination by any authority with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary which, by application of similar principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed material increase in Tax, in excess of that provided for in any reserve
for Taxes, for any other period not so examined. All income Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries through the year ended May&nbsp;31, 2003 have been examined by the IRS or other appropriate
taxing authority and the examination concluded, or are Tax Returns with respect to which the period during which any assessments may be made by the IRS or other appropriate taxing authority has expired (taking into account any extension or waiver
thereof). All material deficiencies and assessments asserted as a result of such examinations or other audits by federal, state, local or foreign taxing authorities have been paid, fully settled or adequately provided for in the Company&#146;s
financial statements, and no issue or claim has been asserted in writing for material Taxes by any taxing authority for any prior period, other than those heretofore paid, fully settled or adequately provided for in the Company&#146;s financial
statements. There are no outstanding agreements or waivers extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i)&nbsp;has been a
