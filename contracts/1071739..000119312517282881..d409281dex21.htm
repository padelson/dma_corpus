of the Enrollment Notice and calculation of the Closing Enrollment, the

Seller with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by Seller). If Seller
does not deliver a Enrollment Objection Notice to Buyer on or before the

Enrollment Notice and the calculations therein in full. Any determination set
forth on the Enrollment Notice which is not specifically objected to in the
Enrollment Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall be
final and binding upon Seller upon delivery of the Enrollment Objection

(d) In the event that Seller delivers an Enrollment Objection Notice objecting
to all or any portion of the Closing Statement within the Review Period,
Buyer and Seller shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt to resolve such
objections. Any such objections set forth in the Enrollment Objection Notice
which cannot be resolved between Buyer and Seller within thirty (30)
days following Buyers receipt of the Enrollment Objection Notice (the "
_Enrollment Disputed Items_ ") shall be resolved in accordance with this
Section 2.07(d). Should Seller and Buyer not be able to resolve
such Enrollment Disputed Items within the thirty (30) day period described
above, either party may submit the matter to the Independent Accountants for
review and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of its engagement, and
to resolve any objections consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The
Independent Accountants shall only have authority to make determinations in
respect of Enrollment Disputed Items, and all determinations shall be based
solely on the presentations of Buyer and Seller and their respective
Representatives, and not by independent review. Buyer and Seller each shall
provide the Independent Accountants with their respective determinations of
the Enrollment Disputed Items. In resolving any Enrollment Disputed Item, the
Independent Accountants: (i) shall be bound by the principles set forth in
this Section 2.07, (ii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party, and (iii) shall act as an expert
and not an arbitrator. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountants
to deliver to each of Buyer and Seller a written statement setting forth its
resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
dispute to such firm, which resolution, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties and not subject to appeal or further
review. The Enrollment Notice shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination by the Independent Accountants, as well as the resolution by or
on behalf of the parties of any Enrollment Disputed Item. All Enrollment
Disputed Items that are resolved between Seller and Buyer and all Enrollment
Disputed Items that are determined by the Independent Accountants will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto and may be entered in any
Court of competent jurisdiction, and each of the Parties

 



\- 36 -  hereto agrees that it shall not have any right to, and shall not, institute
any Action of any kind challenging such determination or with respect to the
matters that are the subject of this Section 2.07. The other Partys only
defense to such a request for enforcement shall be fraud by or upon the
Independent Accountant or manifest error. Absent such fraud or manifest error,
such other party shall reimburse the Party seeking enforcement for all of its
expenses related to the enforcement of the Independent Accountants
determination. The fees and costs of the Independent Accountants shall follow
the methodology set forth in Section 2.07(b). The fees and costs of the
Independent Accountants, if one is required, shall be borne by Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accountants,
which proportionate allocation will also be determined by the Independent
Accountants.

(e) If the Closing Enrollment results in a decrease in the Closing Cash
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.05, then Seller shall pay the amount of
such decrease to Buyer in cash or other immediately available funds within
five (5) Business Days of determination of the Closing Enrollment. If the
Closing Enrollment results in an increase in the Closing Cash Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.05, then Buyer shall pay the amount of such excess to
Seller in cash or other immediately available funds within five (5) Business
Days of determination of the Closing Enrollment. If the Closing Acquired Cash
Amount exceeds the Estimated Acquired Cash Amount, then Buyer shall pay the
amount of such excess to Seller in cash or other immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days of determination of the Closing Acquired Cash
Amount. If the Estimated Acquired Cash Amount exceeds the Closing Acquired
Cash Amount, then Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to Buyer in
cash or other immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days of
determination of the Closing Acquired Cash Amount. If the Closing Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay
the amount of such excess to Seller in cash or other immediately available
funds within five (5) Business Days of determination of the Closing Working
Capital. If the Estimated Working Capital is greater than the Closing Working
Capital, then Seller shall pay the amount of such excess to Buyer in cash or
other immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days of
determination of the Closing Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, if
Seller fails to promptly pay any amounts due to Buyer under this Section
2.07(e), Buyer may demand that such amount be paid to Buyer from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Seller shall promptly
thereafter deposit such amount into the Escrow Fund.

 

Section 2.08 Determination of Working Capital Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
have delivered to Buyer a written statement (the " _Estimated Closing

Working Capital Methodologies along with reasonable supporting detail to
evidence the calculation thereof.

(b) On or after the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, but no later
than thirty (30) calendar days following the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) Buyers calculation of Acquired Cash
(the " _Final Acquired Cash Amount_ ") and (ii) Buyers calculation of the
Working Capital (the " _Final Working Capital_ ") determined in accordance
with the Working Capital Methodologies, along with reasonable supporting
detail as part of the Closing Statement to evidence the calculation thereof.

 



\- 37 - (c) Seller shall have thirty (30) days following Buyers delivery of the
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the same. If Seller
objects to any portion of the Closing Statement on or before the expiration of
the Review Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement setting
forth in reasonable detail and accompanied by reasonable supporting
information, its objection to the Closing Statement (the " _Closing Statement
Objection Notice_ "). During the Review Period, Buyer shall upon reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours permit Seller and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements, memoranda,
etc.) and shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining work papers
from Buyers accountants pertaining to or used in connection with the
preparation of the Closing Statement and calculation of the Final Acquired
Cash Amount and Final Working Capital, and provide Seller with copies thereof
(as reasonably requested by Seller). If Seller does not deliver a Closing
Statement Objection Notice to Buyer on or before the expiration of the Review
Period, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement and the
calculations therein in full. Any determination set forth on the Closing
Statement which is not specifically objected to in the Closing Statement
Objection Notice shall be deemed accepted by Seller and shall be final and
binding upon Seller upon delivery of the Closing Statement Objection Notice.

(d) In the event that Seller delivers a Closing Statement Objection
Notice objecting to all or any portion of the Closing Statement within the
Review Period, Buyer and Seller shall promptly meet and in good faith attempt
to resolve such objections. Any such objections set forth in the Closing
Statement Objection Notice which cannot be resolved between Buyer and Seller
within thirty (30) days following Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement
Objection Notice (the " _Closing Statement Disputed Items_ ") shall be
resolved in accordance with this Section 2.08(d). Should Seller and Buyer not
be able to resolve such Closing Statement Disputed Items within the thirty
(30) day period described above, either party may submit the matter to the
Independent Accountants for review and resolution, with instructions to
complete the same as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty
(30) days of its engagement, and to resolve any objections consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including making the calculations in accordance with
the Working Capital Methodologies. The Independent Accountants shall only have
authority to make determinations in respect of Closing Statement Disputed
Items, and all determinations shall be based solely on the presentations of
Buyer and Seller and their respective representatives, and not by independent
review. Buyer and Seller each shall provide the Independent Accountants with
their respective determinations of the Closing Statement Disputed Items.
In resolving any Closing Statement Disputed Item, the Independent
Accountants: (i) shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section
2.08, (ii) shall not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either Party, and (iii) shall act as an expert and
not an arbitrator. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accountants to
deliver to each of Buyer and Seller a written statement setting forth its
resolution of the dispute within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
dispute to such firm, which resolution, absent manifest error, shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties and not subject to appeal or further
review. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such
determination by the Independent Accountants, as well as the resolution by or
on behalf of the parties of any Closing 

 



\- 38 -  Statement Disputed Item. All Closing Statement Disputed Items that are
resolved between Seller and Buyer and all Closing Statement Disputed Items
that are determined by the Independent Accountants will be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties hereto and may be entered in any Court of competent
jurisdiction, and each of the Parties hereto agrees that it shall not have any
right to, and shall not, institute any Action of any kind challenging such
determination or with respect to the matters that are the subject of this
Section 2.08. The other Partys only defense to such a request for enforcement
shall be fraud by or upon the Independent Accountant or manifest error.
Absent such fraud or manifest error, such other party shall reimburse the
Party seeking enforcement for all of its expenses related to the enforcement
of the Independent Accountants determination. The fees and costs of
the Independent Accountants, if one is required, shall be borne by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on the matters resolved by the Independent Accountants, which
proportionate allocation will also be determined by the Independent
Accountants.

(e) Determinations; Adjustments. If the Final Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08 is greater than the Closing
Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller the full amount by which the Final
Working Capital is greater than the Closing Working Capital in accordance
with Section 2.08(f). If Final Working Capital as finally determined pursuant
to this Section 2.08 is less than the Closing Working Capital, Seller shall
pay to Buyer the full amount by which the Closing Working Capital is
greater than Final Working Capital in accordance with Section 2.08(f). If the
Final Acquired Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08
is greater than the Closing Acquired Cash Amount, Buyer shall pay to
Seller the full amount by which Final Acquired Cash Amount exceeds Closing
Acquired Cash Amount in accordance with Section 2.08(f). If the Final Acquired
Cash Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.08 is less
than the Closing Acquired Cash Amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer the full
amount by which Closing Acquired Cash Amount exceeds Final Acquired Amount in
accordance with Section 2.08(f). For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller fails
to promptly pay any amounts due to Buyer under this Section 2.08(e), Buyer
may demand that such amount be paid to Buyer from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Seller shall promptly thereafter
deposit such amount into the Escrow Fund.

(f) Final Payments. The amount (if any) owed to Seller, on the one hand, or to
Buyer, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 2.08(e) shall be referred to as
the " _Final Closing Adjustment_." If Buyer is obligated to pay the Final
Closing Adjustment, it shall make payment to Seller in cash by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
Seller. If Seller is obligated to pay the Final Closing Adjustment, Seller
shall make payment to Buyer in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Buyer. Any payment required
under this Section 2.08(f) shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment. For the avoidance of
doubt, if Seller fails to promptly pay any amounts due to Buyer under this
Section 2.08(f), Buyer may demand that such amount be paid to Buyer from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and the Seller shall
promptly thereafter deposit such amount into the Escrow Fund. 

 



\- 39 - Section 2.09 Allocation of Purchase Price. Within sixty (60) days after
Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a proposed allocation of
the total consideration to be paid to Seller by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement for the Purchased Assets, which shall include relevant Assumed
Liabilities, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of Law, as
appropriate) (the " _Purchase Price Allocation_ "). In the event that Seller
objects to the Purchase Price Allocation, Seller shall notify Buyer of such
objection within twenty (20) days of receipt of the Purchase Price Allocation
and the parties will endeavor to resolve such dispute in good faith prior to
Closing. In the event that Buyer and Seller agree on the Purchase Price
Allocation (or if Seller does not object within the twenty (20)-day period
described above), each of Seller and Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall report and file Tax Returns, in all respects and for all Tax purposes
consistent with such mutually agreed upon allocation, and neither Seller nor
Buyer shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns, or otherwise)
which is inconsistent with such allocation, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or a determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the
Code. In the event that Buyer and Seller do not agree on the Purchase Price
Allocation, the items in dispute shall be referred to the Independent
Accountant for a determination that is final and binding on the Parties.

Section 2.10 Third Party Consents. Subject to Section 6.08(a) and Section
6.08(d), Seller, with Buyers reasonable cooperation, shall use reasonable
best efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all consents from all third
parties that are described on Section 4.04 of the Disclosure Schedules. To
the extent that Sellers or its Subsidiaries rights under any Contract
constituting a Purchased Asset, or any other Purchased Asset, may not be
assigned to Buyer without the consent of another Person which has not
been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would constitute a
breach thereof or be unlawful, and Seller and Buyer shall, at Sellers
expense, cooperate in good faith and shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as possible.
If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would
be ineffective or would impair Buyers rights under the Purchased Asset in
question so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such
rights, Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law and the Purchased Asset, shall act after the Closing at
Sellers sole cost and expense, as Buyers agent in order to obtain for Buyer
the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted
by Law and the Purchased Asset, with Buyer in any other
reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Section 2.10 to the contrary, Buyer
shall not be deemed to have waived its rights under Section 7.02(b) hereof
unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers thereof or elects to
proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
Closing.

 

Section 2.11 Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration and any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to Seller or any other Person such amounts as Buyer is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made. Prior to any such withholding, Buyer shall give notice
to Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing and will consult
in good faith with Seller.

Adverse Effect.

foreign entity and is in good standing under the Laws of each jurisdiction
listed on Section 4.02(b) of the Disclosure Schedules and each other

of the organizational documents of Seller and its Subsidiaries as amended to

on the part of such Persons, and no other proceedings on the part of such
Persons are requisite to authorize the execution, delivery and performance
thereof by such Person. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer)
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding at law or in equity). When each other Transaction Document to
which Seller is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Seller (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each
other party thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and
binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

cancellation under, any Material Contract or Permit to which Seller or its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or the Purchased Assets are
bound or affected (for purposes of this Section 4.04(c), in each case,
without giving effect to Section 2.10 and, for the avoidance of doubt,
including any Material Contracts which are Excluded Contracts); or (d) result
in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on the Purchased Assets. No

any Governmental Authority is required by or with respect to Seller or its

which it is presently being used and Seller or its Subsidiaries have adequate
rights of ingress and egress into and from each for the operation of the
business of Seller or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course. None of the

exists, or if it is, then Seller or its Subsidiaries have delivered the
appropriate subordination and non-disturbance agreement for the applicable
Real Property Lease confirming that the rights of Seller or its Subsidiaries
under the Real Property Lease will not be disturbed. Neither Seller nor its
Subsidiaries have collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest
in the Leased Real Property or any interest therein. Neither Seller nor its
Subsidiaries have subleased, licensed or otherwise granted to any Person
the right to use or occupy any portion of the Leased Real Property. Neither

maintained in accordance with normal industry practice. Neither Seller nor
its Subsidiaries have received written notice of and there are no existing,
proposed or threatened eminent domain or other proceedings that would result
in the taking of all or any part of the Leased Real Property. Seller
hereby represents and warrants that neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries owns

of its Subsidiaries. No provision of a benefit, acceleration, or amount to be
paid with respect to any current or former employee of, or consultant or other

result in "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)
of the Code; or (ii) require a "gross-up" or other payment to any
"disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code.

and none of the SEC Reports, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The financial statements of Buyer included (or incorporated by reference)
in the SEC Reports (including the notes thereto) comply in all material

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Buyers financial reporting
and the preparation of Buyers financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and that (a) transactions are executed in accordance with
managements general or specific authorization, (b) transactions are recorded

GAAP and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization, and

effective to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Buyer in the reports it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SECs rules and forms. Buyers management has completed an evaluation of
the effectiveness of Buyers internal controls over financial reporting as
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and has concluded that such internal controls were
effective. Buyer has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of Buyers
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,

material weaknesses in the design or operation of Buyers internal control
over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Buyers ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyers internal
control over financial reporting. Buyers management has evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of Buyers disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable SEC

 



\- 66 -  Report that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto,
filed prior to the date of this Agreement,

 

its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation (and as of the most recent evaluation, such
disclosure controls and procedures were effective). Since the date of the most
recent evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures and internal
controls, there have been no material changes in such controls or in other
factors that would reasonably be expected to materially affect disclosure
controls and procedures or internal controls, including any corrective actions
with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

Section 5.11 Listing and Maintenance. The Buyer Common Stock is registered

terminating such registration. Buyer is in material compliance with the
listing and maintenance requirements and any other applicable rules and
regulations of the NYSE.

Section 6.02 Access to Information. From the Signing Date until the Closing,
Seller shall (a) furnish Buyer and its Representatives and Financing Sources
with such financial, operating and other data and information as Buyer or any
of its Representatives or Financing Sources may reasonably request related to
(i) the Business, or (ii) the Purchased Assets; (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Buyer (i) sufficiently in advance of the
Closing, copies of such information as is reasonably requested by Buyer and
its Representatives in order for Buyer to assume operations on the Closing
Date for the transition of the Enrollees and continuity of care"acqired, and
(ii) copies of such other information as is necessary for the operation,
ownership and management of the Business or which is otherwise reasonably
requested by Buyer, and which Seller is permitted by applicable Law to provide
or which is required in writing to be provided to Buyer by DFS, DOH or
CMS (and Seller shall provide such written consents and authorizations as may
be reasonably necessary for Buyer to have access to materials on file with any
Governmental Authority), including any information as may be required to
permit Buyer to satisfy its obligations to any Governmental Authority
following the Closing, including any third party accreditation or review
organization (such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance); and (c)
make available to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
Representatives of Buyer upon the reasonable request of Buyer and during
normal working hours, officers, accountants, counsel, consultants, investment
banker and other Representatives or agents of Seller for discussion of the
Business as Buyer may reasonably request. Any inquiries pursuant to this
Section 6.02 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the Business or any other businesses of
Seller. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
to the contrary shall in any manner restrict the ability of Buyer, from and
after the date of this Agreement, to discuss the business and affairs of
Seller or its Subsidiaries with any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over Seller or its Subsidiaries or the fiscal intermediaries
administering Sellers payor programs. From the date hereof until the earlier
of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Article IX, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to contact such third
parties, including customers, prospective customers, specifying agencies,
vendors or suppliers of Seller and its Subsidiaries, as Seller and Buyer
mutually deem reasonably necessary. Prior to the Closing Date and after any
termination of this Agreement, each Party shall hold and shall cause its
Representatives to hold, in confidence, all confidential documents and
information concerning the other Partys or any of its Subsidiaries furnished
to a Party or its Representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the manner and for the time period specified
in (i) the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 24, 2017 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (ii) the Clean Team Agreement dated July
21, 2017, in each case, between Buyer and Seller, and as further amended from
time to time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Closing Date and
prior to any termination of this Agreement, nothing in the foregoing sentence
shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosures made by Buyer and its
Affiliates to the Financing Sources, rating agencies, prospective traders,
prospective Financing Sources, existing lenders (and related agents) or
otherwise in connection with efforts

 



\- 71 -  or activities by Buyer or the Financing Sources to obtain the Financing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.02 shall be construed
to obligate Seller or its Subsidiaries to provide any information or reports
to Buyer in a form that Seller and its Subsidiaries do not generate in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice if providing
information or reports in such form would be reasonably expected to interfere
in any material respect with the conduct of the Business or any other
businesses of Seller.

Section 6.03 No Solicitation of Other Bids.

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements
or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition
Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and or cause to be terminated, and
shall cause the other Seller Parties to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal and shall notify each such party that it, or any
Representative retained by it, no longer seeks or requires the making of any
Acquisition Proposal, and withdraws any consent theretofore given to the
making of an Acquisition Proposal. None of the Seller Parties shall, directly
or indirectly, and each of the Seller Parties shall cause their Affiliates and
their respective Representatives not to, solicit, initiate or conduct any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or otherwise
cooperate in any other way with, or facilitate or encourage any effort to
attempt to, or enter into any agreement or understanding with, any Person or
group of Persons regarding any Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect
disposition, whether by sale, merger or otherwise, of all or any portion of
the Business or the Purchased Assets or any public announcement of a proposal,
plan or intention to do the foregoing or any agreement to engage in the
foregoing. At the Closing, Seller shall assign to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates all confidentiality agreements, non-disclosure agreements,
standstill agreements or similar agreements entered into with any third
parties regarding any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if any such attempted assignment would be ineffective, then from and after
the Closing, Seller will continue to enforce its rights under such agreements
on Buyers behalf.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this Section 6.03, Seller shall
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof
by any Seller Party) advise Buyer orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and the identity of the Person making the same. 

(c) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 6.03 shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
Court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any
such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer. 

 



\- 72 - Section 6.04 Notice of Certain Events.

 

(a) From the Signing Date until the earlier of termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article IX or the Closing, Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing of:

(i) any fact, circumstance, event or action the existence, occurrence or
taking of which (A) has had or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (B) has resulted
in any representation or warranty made by Seller hereunder not being true and
correct (to the extent occurring or arising after the Signing Date, a "
_Disclosure Update_ "), or (C) has resulted in, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.02 to be satisfied;

(ii) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority, other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
which does not relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents; and

 

(iv) any Actions commenced or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to, involving or otherwise affecting the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that, if pending on the Signing Date, would
have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.10 or that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) No Disclosure Update shall be deemed to modify, or cure any breach of
Sellers representations and warranties in this Agreement or have any effect
for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.02 (other than Section 7.02(c)) or the obligations of Seller under
Article VII.

Section 6.05 Employees.

 

(a) Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable access during normal business
hours to the employees of the Business not less than forty-five (45) days
prior to the Closing Date and with information reasonably requested by Buyer
with respect to compensation and benefits of the employees of the Business. No
less than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, to be effective as of the
Closing but contingent on the Closing, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall
offer employment to all individuals who are employed by Sellers or its
Subsidiaries in good standing in the operation of the Business; _provided
however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to make offers of employment to
(i) any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries who does not satisfy Buyers
employment policies regarding employee documentation, drug testing, background
screening, and other similar matters or (ii) any Inactive Employee, except as
set forth in this Section 6.05. Each such offer of employment shall provide
for the payments and benefits required to be provided by Section 6.05(c). Each
employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries who reports to work on the first work
day immediately following the Closing (after taking into

 



\- 73 -  account any authorized paid time off) and commences employment with Buyer as
of immediately following the Closing (after taking into account any authorized
paid time off) shall be considered a " _Hired Employee_." Any Inactive
Employee who returns to active employment within six (6) months of the Closing
Date, or such longer period as required by applicable Law, and who satisfies
Buyers employment policies regarding employee documentation, drug testing,
background screening, and other similar matters shall be considered a Hired
Employee upon such Inactive Employees commencement of employment with Buyer,
provided such date is within six (6) months of the Closing Date. Buyer and
its Affiliates shall only be responsible for Liabilities relating to an
Inactive Employee from and after the date such Inactive Employee becomes a
Hired Employee. From the Closing Date through the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not terminate any Hired Employee other than (1) for
Cause or (2) due to the occurrence of any material adverse change to the
Business (including as a result of any Change in Healthcare Laws) during such
twelve (12) month period.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
terminate the employment of all of the Hired Employees as of the Closing, or,
with respect to any Inactive Employee who becomes a Hired Employee after the
Closing Date, upon their commencement of employment with Buyer in accordance
with Section 6.05(a). Except as otherwise specified herein, effective as of
the Closing, all Hired Employees will cease to be active participants in the
Seller Employee Plans (other than Assumed Plans) and will become participants
in the corresponding new or existing plans of Buyer and its Affiliates,
including group health and other welfare benefit plans in each case subject to
the terms thereof; _provided however_ , that Seller shall maintain each
Inactive Employees participation in the Seller Employee Plans in accordance
with the terms of such plans in effect from time to time.

(c) For the one (1) year period described in Section 6.05(a), Buyer shall
provide or cause to be provided to each Hired Employee (i) base salary or base
wages and annual or other periodic cash incentive opportunities (excluding any
retention bonuses and other special or non-recurring bonuses or cash awards)
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than cash compensation payable to
such Hired Employee by Seller or its Subsidiaries immediately before Closing
(excluding any retention bonuses and other target-level special or non-
recurring bonuses or cash awards), and (ii) retirement, welfare, fringe and
other employee benefits (excluding any nonqualified deferred compensation or
equity benefits) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits that are provided to them by Seller and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Seller Employee Plans or, in
Buyers discretion, are substantially comparable to those made available to
similarly situated employees of Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates.

(d) Seller shall be responsible for timely payment, in accordance with the
applicable arrangement, plan or policies, of all Seller Employee Payables to
the person or persons entitled thereto; provided that Seller shall only be
obligated to pay accrued paid time off in respect of any Hired Employees in
excess of their one hundred and fifty (150) hours. All such payments that are
subject to the applicable Tax withholding will be made through Sellers
payroll system. Buyer shall assume and shall be solely responsible for
the payment or satisfaction of any and all Liabilities with respect to (i)
any Hired Employee arising after the Closing Date and (ii) the Assumed Plans
after the Closing Date. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Seller
shall use best efforts to cause the Assumed Plans to be assigned to Buyer as
of the Closing. To the extent Seller is not able to assign an Assumed Plan to
Buyer, such plan shall no longer be designated as an Assumed Plan and the
Parties shall cooperate in good faith to either implement a mirror plan at
Buyer or transition the Hired Employees to a plan of Buyer and its Affiliates
as of the Closing.

 



\- 74 - (e) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that (i) all
Hired Employees receive credit for prior service with Seller and its
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit accruals or
eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan)
under any employee benefit or compensatory plan, program or arrangement of
Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates in which Hired Employees are eligible to
participate to the extent such prior service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits, (ii) subject to any required consent under applicable
Law, all Hired Employees receive credit for their accrued paid time off as of
the Closing up to One Hundred and Fifty (150) hours, (iii) any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical
examinations under any group health benefit plans of Buyer or any of Buyers
Affiliates will be waived with respect to Hired Employees and their
eligible spouses and dependents, to the extent waived or satisfied under a
corresponding Seller Employee Plan in which the applicable Hired Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing; and (iv) subject to Seller
providing adequate data to Buyer, in a format required by Buyer, that the
Hired Employees and their eligible spouses, dependents and beneficiaries will
receive credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred
prior to the Closing Date that were credited for the same purpose to such
individual under the corresponding Seller Employee Plan as of the Closing
Date.

 

(f) Prior to, and effective as of, the Closing, Seller shall amend the Seller
403(b) Retirement Savings Plan (the " _403(b) Plan_ ") to discontinue
(freeze) all employee and employer contributions thereunder. At the Closing,
Seller shall assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, Sellers
sponsorship of, and all of Sellers rights, title and interest in, the 403(b)
Plan, and Buyer shall assume sponsorship of, and perform and discharge all
Liabilities under, the 403(b) Plan after the Closing. Buyer shall continue to
maintain the 403(b) Plan after the Closing as a frozen plan until the 403(b)
Plan is terminated by Buyer, at its discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall Buyer permit any employee or employer contributions to be made
to the 403(b) Plan on or after the Closing; provided, however, that after the
Closing and until the Buyer terminates the 403(b) Plan, Hired Employees with
unvested account balances under the 403(b) Plan may continue to vest under the
terms of the 403(b) Plan and, to the extent permitted by Law, Hired Employees
with outstanding loan balances under the 403(b) Plan shall be permitted to
make scheduled loan payments under the 403(b) Plan so as to avoid, to the
extent possible, a loan default and deemed distribution with respect to such
outstanding loans. Buyer shall adopt or designate a new or existing tax-
qualified defined contribution retirement plan of the Buyer with a cash or
deferred arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k)
Plan_ ") that will cover Hired Employees on and after the Closing.

(g) This Section 6.05 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the Parties. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall
be deemed to confer upon any Hired Employee (or any spouse, dependent,
beneficiary of or other Person claiming through such Hired Employee) any third
party beneficiary rights or remedies of any nature

 



\- 75 -  whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.05, (ii) shall be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any Seller Employee Plan or any other benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the
ability of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or (iv) is intended to or shall confer upon any
current or former employee of Business or any other person any right to
employment or continued employment or service for any period of time by reason
of this Agreement or any other related agreement, or any right to
a particular term or condition of employment.

(h) Seller and Buyer agree that, for purposes of any of Sellers nonqualified
deferred compensation plans maintained under Section 457(f) of the Code, the
Hired Employees shall be deemed to have incurred a "separation from service"
within the meaning of Code Section 409A as a result of their termination
of employment with Seller hereunder.

Section 6.06 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, the Seller shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, hold, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to hold, in
confidence any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the
Business and Purchased Assets, except to the extent that (a) such information
relates to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, except to the extent such
information relates to the Business, (b) such information is generally
available to and known by the public through no fault of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives, or (c) is lawfully acquired by Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or Representatives from and after the Closing from sources
(other than Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective Representatives)
which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation. If Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial
or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer in writing, if and to the extent Seller is permitted by
applicable Law to do so, and shall disclose only that portion of such
information which Seller are advised by its counsel is legally required to be
disclosed, provided that Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at
Buyers expense, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information.

(a) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
either for Sellers own benefit or for the benefit of any other Person, (i)

assist or provide any material services to any Person in engaging in
a Restricted Business in the Territory; (ii) have an ownership interest in
any capacity, including as a partner, shareholder, member, principal, joint

Seller to have become a Provider, Enrollee, supplier or licensor of the
Business during the Restricted Period) to terminate or modify its business
relationship with the Business in a manner adverse to the Business; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that it will not constitute a breach of this Section
6.07(a) for Seller or any of its Affiliates to (x) acquire

 



\- 76 -  any business entity which engages in the Restricted Business in the
Territory if such business entitys revenues from the operation of the
Restricted Business constitute less than five percent (5%) of such business
entitys total revenues (measured based on actual trailing twelve month
revenues from the date of measurement) at all times during the Restricted
Period, or (y) acquire or hold bonds or up to five percent (5%) of the
outstanding shares of any class or series of equity securities of any entity
if such bonds or equity securities are publicly traded.

 

(b) During the Restricted Period, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or
hire any Hired Employee, or encourage any Hired Employee to leave such
employment or hire any Hired Employee who has left such employment, except
pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed specifically to any
Hired Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section
6.07(b) shall prevent Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from hiring any
employee of Buyer whose employment has been terminated by Buyer and such
termination was not directly or indirectly attributable to actions of Seller.

(c) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section
6.07 will give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer, for which monetary damages
will not be an adequate remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a
breach or a threatened breach by Seller of any such obligations, Buyer shall,

it in respect of such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any
other relief that may be available from a Court of competent jurisdiction.

constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
any covenant contained in this Section 6.07 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any Court is expressly empowered
to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such
jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
Section 6.07 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants
and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the

or any of its Affiliates, shall be required to propose, commit to, agree to or
effect any action (or refrain from taking any action) that is required by a
Governmental Authority in connection with the imposition of a Burdensome
Condition. Subject to each partys compliance with its obligations under this
Section 6.08, without the prior written consent of the other party, no party
shall, with respect to any Governmental Authority, propose, negotiate, commit
to or effect any restriction, condition, limitation or requirement, effective
as of the Closing Date, (i) in the case of Seller, on the Business, Purchased
Assets or Assumed Liabilities, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates and their
respective businesses or (ii) in the case of Buyer, on Seller or any of its
Affiliates and their respective businesses.

 

(c) The Parties agree that, with respect to the Required Governmental
Approvals, Buyer and Seller shall mutually determine (i) the scheduling of,
and strategic planning for, any meeting with or filing with any Governmental
Authority, (ii) the process for receipt of any Required Governmental Approvals

submission or attendance all analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or
on behalf of either Party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or
regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the
Transaction ( _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be required to
disclose to the other Party at any time (a) any interactions between Seller or
Buyer with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business, (b)
any disclosure which is not permitted by Law, or (c) other than to the other
Partys outside antitrust counsel, any disclosure containing confidential or
proprietary information, any attorney-client privileged documents or
communications, and any appraisals, valuations, market studies, legal or
financial opinions, or board presentations prepared, submitted and/or reviewed
in connection with any application for a Required Governmental Approval), it
being the intent that the Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection
with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals and (y) each Party shall
give notice to the other Party with respect to

 



\- 78 -  any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental
Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such
notice being sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact, it
being understood that a Governmental Authority may require, or insist upon,
only communicating with and through the Seller or Buyer, as applicable.

(d) Seller shall give any notices to third parties in connection with all
Assigned Contracts or other Purchased Assets for which the consent of a third
party is required to transfer such Assigned Contract or other Purchased Asset
to Buyer or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
consents. Seller shall regularly consult with Buyer in connection with the
foregoing. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with
Sellers efforts related thereto. Seller shall pay any consideration, fees or
costs therefor to any third party from whom a consent is requested, if and to
the extent required by such third party.

Section 6.09 New Material Contracts.

(a) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any new Material Contract (including
any Provider Contract which would reasonably be expected to become a Material
Provider Contract, based on anticipated payments during the twelve (12) months
following its execution) proposed to be executed after the Signing Date on
behalf of Seller (and any Material Contract which has not been provided to
Buyer on or before the Signing Date). Buyer may elect, at any time and in its
sole discretion, to treat any such new Material Contract as an Excluded
Contract.

 

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees to promptly supply to Buyer, when
reasonably requested, such information and materials (including specific
answers or responses) required in connection with receipt of any required
consents, authorizations, orders and approvals which relate to the provider
network, the Provider Contracts and the continuity of services (such
information and materials to be in such form as may reasonably be requested
for purposes of filings with the applicable regulatory authorities). Without
limiting the generality of Section 2.10, with respect to any Assumed Provider
Contract requiring consent of the Provider to transfer or assign it: (A) this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer any right,
benefit or obligation arising thereunder if an assignment or transfer without
the consent of the Provider would constitute a breach or violation thereof or
adversely affect the rights of Seller or Buyer thereunder (however, the
foregoing shall not excuse or waive any breach of any representation or
warranty contained herein) and (B) before the Closing, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Provider Contract to be assigned with
any required consent, and if such consent cannot be obtained, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer to obtain its own direct
contract on terms acceptable to Buyer.

Section 6.10 Closing Conditions. From the Signing Date until the Closing,

agreed to by the Parties, unless required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or as
may be requested by a Governmental Authority, in which case the issuing party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before
issuing any such release or making any such public statement, and the issuing
party shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or public statement in advance of such issuance and shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments of such party. Upon execution of this Agreement
and upon the Closing, Seller and Buyer (or their respective Affiliates) shall
each issue press releases announcing the transaction, in each case in
accordance with a communications plan mutually agreed to by the Parties.
Buyers press release announcing the transaction shall include the statements
set forth on Exhibit Q attached hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, neither
the foregoing nor any other provision of this Agreement or the Confidentiality
Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure made by Buyer and
its Affiliates or any of these deemed representations to the Financing
Sources, rating agencies, prospective traders, existing lenders (and related
agents) or otherwise in connection with efforts or activities by Buyer to
obtain the Financing.

 

Section 6.12 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any
or all of the Purchased Assets to Buyer; it being understood that any
Liabilities arising out of the failure of Seller to comply with the
requirements and provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws
of any jurisdiction which would not otherwise constitute Assumed Liabilities
shall be treated as Excluded Liabilities.

 

Section 6.13 Reconciliation. If Buyer collects or receives any Excluded Asset
from any third party after the Closing, then Buyer shall deliver such
Excluded Asset to Seller as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof. If Seller collects or receives any Purchased Asset from any third

Purchased Asset(s) as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof.

after the Closing and Seller shall forward any claim for an Assumed Liability
to Buyer after the Closing. Without limitation to this Section 6.13, Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in Buyers collection of the receivables
that are Purchased Assets.

 

Section 6.14 Transition Planning. Between the Signing Date and the Closing
Date, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer from time to time to develop and implement an integration and transition
plan for the Business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate to develop and implement a mutually agreeable
communications plan with respect to the Enrollees and Providers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Seller make a general
announcement to its or its Subsidiaries employees regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement before any press releases have been issued by
Buyer or Seller in accordance with Section 6.11.

 



\- 80 - Section 6.15 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the Parties
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, Seller shall, on and after the Closing Date, transfer (or

services related to the operation of the Business, as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer (and, in the case of electronic data files, in such

__(a) After the Closing, each Party shall afford the other Party and its

business hours, reasonable access to the books, records and other information
in such Party s possession relating to the Business, and the right to make
copies and extracts therefrom at its expense, or shall provide copies of such
information to the other Party, in each case to the extent such access is
reasonably required by the requesting Party (i) to comply with reporting,
disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed by a Governmental Authority,
(ii) for use in the conduct of any Tax audit or other proceeding in respect of
Taxes or other litigation in which such requesting Party is a party, (iii) to

_provided_ , that, Buyer agrees to treat such information as confidential, if
applicable. __

(b) In addition, after the Closing Seller shall provide to Buyer such written

For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor Buyer
shall, or permit its Affiliates to, destroy or otherwise dispose of any of the
books, records or other information described in this Section 6.16 relating
to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities without first
offering in writing to surrender such books, records and other information to
the other Party, which other Party shall have ten (10) days after such offer
to agree in writing to take possession thereof. Without limiting the
foregoing, if any Governmental Authority shall, pursuant to applicable Law,
require in writing the transfer by Seller to Buyer of ownership
of information related to the Business as operated prior to the Closing,
Seller and Buyer shall coordinate in good faith to effect such transfer;
_provided_ , that, in no event shall Seller be required to transfer ownership
of any information which Seller requires for the run-out of the Medicaid
Business and Medicare Business by Seller.

Subsidiaries, hereby grants to Buyer (i) for a period of no longer than nine
(9) months after the Closing, a non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free
license to use the Corporate Name solely to effectuate the transition by
Buyer to new names and marks as promptly as possible (the " _Phase-Out
License_ "), and (ii) solely to the extent necessary in connection with its
performance of its rights and obligations under the Medicare Reinsurance
Agreement and

 



\- 81 -  the QHP and EP Reinsurance Agreement and/or administrative matters relating
thereto, a perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable to Affiliates of Buyer (only
in connection with the operation of Business), and transferable (upon prior
written consent of Seller in connection with the sale or transfer of all or an
applicable portion of the Business, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), non-exclusive, worldwide, and royalty-free
license to use the Corporate Name (or any successor name adopted by Seller)
and names and marks incorporating the Corporate Name (or any successor name
adopted by Seller) (the "Long-Term License"). As soon as reasonably

performance of its rights and obligations under the Long-Term License.
All goodwill associated with the Corporate Name generated by Buyers use of
the Corporate Name pursuant to the foregoing license in this Section 6.16(c)
shall inure to the benefit of Seller. Buyer shall use the Corporate Name at a
level of quality equivalent in all material respects to that in effect for
the Corporate Name as of the Closing. For purposes of clarity, nothing in this
Section 6.16(c) shall preclude any uses of the Corporate Name by Buyer that
are required or otherwise not prohibited under applicable Law, including uses
of the Corporate Name not in commerce, uses that would not cause confusion as
to the origin of a good or service, uses for historical and administrative
purposes and references to the Corporate Name in historical, Tax, regulatory
and similar records.

respective Affiliates not to, talk about or otherwise publicly communicate to

Seller.

connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and
paid evenly between Buyer and Seller when due; _provided_ , that to the extent
Seller is exempt from any Transfer Tax, but such Transfer Tax (or in the case
of a sales tax, the corresponding use tax) is imposed on the Buyer, such
Transfer Taxes shall be borne and paid by Buyer when due. Buyer shall duly
prepare any Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees
(and Seller shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary), and shall give
Seller a copy of each such Tax Return for its review and comment at least
fifteen (15) days prior to filing. Following such review and comment period,

of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Public Law 111-148
(124 Stat. 119 (2010)), as amended by Section 10905 of PPACA, and as further
amended by Section 1406 of the Health Care and Reconciliation Act of 2010,

any Contract for "health insurance" (within the meaning of Treasury

novated to Buyer, as Sellers "premiums written" for health insurance of
United States health risks (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 57.2) and (iii) determine Sellers "net premiums written"
without reducing such "premiums written" described in clause (i) by any amount

Regulations Section 57.2(b)) in the applicable "test year" (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 57.2(g), (ii) Seller continues to be a
New York not-for-profit corporation that is exempt from Tax within the meaning

Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 __(a) Unless, and to the extent, Buyer shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of Seller that Buyer shall have sufficient cash from
other sources (including by reason of capital markets, securities or other
financing transactions) available to satisfy its cash payment obligations
under this Agreement, from and after the execution of this Agreement,
Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to the
Commitment Letter, if such amendment or modification (A) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount required together with the
other sources to pay the Required Funding Amount or (B) imposes additional
conditions or otherwise amends any of the conditions to the receipt of the
Financing in a manner that could reasonably be expected to (I) prevent the
Closing from occurring prior to the Termination Date, (II) make the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) materially less likely to occur or (III) materially impact the
ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto. For the
avoidance of doubt, but subject to the foregoing, Buyer may amend, supplement,
modify or replace the Commitment Letter as in effect at the date hereof (x) to
add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement, (y) to increase the amount of indebtedness or (z) to replace
all or a portion of the facility committed under the Commitment Letter as in

commitment or facility, a " _Replacement Facility_ "); provided, that the
terms of such Replacement Facility shall comply with clauses (A) and (B)
above. Promptly following the execution of a Replacement Facility by Buyer,
Buyer shall notify the Seller to such effect and shall promptly provide a
fully executed copy of such Replacement Facility and any related agreements

Alternative Financing and, in the case of __Section 6.23(d) __, any offering
or sale of debt or equity securities the proceeds of which are intended to be

"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter as may be
amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this __Section 6.23 __, any
commitment letters with respect to any Replacement Facility, and any
commitment letters with respect to the Alternative Financing. __

(b) Unless, and to the extent, Buyer shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of Seller that Buyer shall have sufficient cash from
other sources (including by reason of a capital market or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this
Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, including to (i) maintain in effect the

 



\- 85 -  Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms (except for amendments not
prohibited by Section 6.23(a)) until the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter

(as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer) than the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements, the
" _Definitive Agreements_ "), and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by
Buyer, seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all conditions to funding in the
Commitment Letter that are within its control and, in the event that all
conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter are satisfied at or prior to
Closing, consummate the Financing at the Closing in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letter as in effect at or prior to the
Closing.

 

(c) Unless, and to the extent, Buyer shall have demonstrated to the reasonable
satisfaction of Seller that Buyer shall have sufficient cash from other
sources (including by reason of a capital market or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this
Agreement, in the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Buyer shall
promptly notify Seller in writing and use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an
amount not less than the Required Funding Amount under this Agreement (the "
_Alternative Financing_ "); provided, however, that Buyer shall not be
required to obtain financing which includes terms and conditions materially
less favorable (taken as whole and taking into account any "market flex"
provision) to Buyer (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer), in
each case relative to those in the Financing being replaced.

 

(d) The Seller shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives, including legal, Tax, regulatory and accounting
Representatives, to provide, at Buyers expense, on a timely basis, all
reasonable cooperation requested by Buyer and/or the Financing Sources in
connection with the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such cooperation shall in any event include: (i) promptly providing
Buyer and the Financing Sources and their respective agents with (A) the
financial information regarding the Seller and its Subsidiaries required to
be delivered pursuant to Section 6(b) and Section 9 of Annex C of the

pursuant to any permitted amendments to the Commitment Letter or pursuant
to any Alternative Financing or Replacement Facility) as such information
relates to the Company and (B) other information, including projections, as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer, the Financing Sources or their
respective agents to prepare customary bank information memoranda, lender

Financing (all information required to be delivered pursuant to this clause
(i) being referred to as the " _Required Information_ "); (ii) participating
(including by making members of senior management, certain representatives
and certain non-legal advisors, in each case with appropriate seniority and

arrangers or agent for, and prospective lenders and purchasers of, the
Financing and senior management and Representatives, in each case with
appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Seller and its Subsidiaries), due
diligence sessions, presentations, "road

Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (taking into account all applicable
extensions). Any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or for a Straddle
Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, procedure
and accounting methods (unless otherwise required by Law). Buyer shall
deliver each such Tax Return (together with schedules, statements and, to the
extent required by such other party, supporting documentation) to Seller for
review and comment at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. If Seller objects to any item on any such Tax
Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify Buyer in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity any
such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Buyer and Seller
shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement
within five (5) days after receipt by Buyer of such notice, the disputed items
shall be resolved by a final determination of the Independent Accountants.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne by Seller
and Buyer in the same proportion by which their respective positions as
initially presented to the Independent Accountants (based on the aggregate of
all differences taken as a whole) differs from the final resolution as
determined by the Independent Accountants. Buyer and Seller agree to file any
Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or to amend any
such Tax Return that was required to be filed during the period the
Independent Accountants were making their determination, consistent with the
Independent Accountants determinations. Seller shall pay (or cause to be
paid) to Buyer any Taxes due with respect to any Tax Returns for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period for which Seller is responsible under
this Agreement no later than three (3) days before the due date for the
payment of such Taxes.

 



\- 89 - (b) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause prompt payment to be made to Seller of

by Salus, Salus IPA, or such Subsidiary, as applicable, with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, net of any tax payable by the party entitled to
receive such refund or apply such credit with respect to its receipt or
application thereof (including with respect to any interest included in such
refund or overpayment) and net of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
associated with collecting such amounts, received; provided, that in the event
that any such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed, Seller shall repay
to the applicable Person an amount equal to such refund or credit (and any
interest thereon paid by a Governmental Authority) within ten (10) days of
written request therefor; provided, further, Seller shall not be entitled to
any refund or credit of Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the
extent attributable to the carryback of any loss, deduction or similar item
arising in a Post-Closing Taxable Period.

 

(c) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer and its Affiliates
(including on or after the Closing Date the Subsidiaries) shall not file, or
cause to be filed, any restatement or amendment of, modification to any Tax
Return of any of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent
such action would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Seller, without
the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Seller and Buyer will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, close
the taxable period of the Salus, Salus IPA and each of their respective
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date. If applicable
Law does not permit a Subsidiary to close their taxable year on the Closing
Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to Straddle
Period, the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period of Salus, Salus
IPA and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall be allocated (i) to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period for the period up to and including the close of
business on the Closing Date, and (ii) to the Post-Closing Tax Period for the
period subsequent to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
except as provided in Section 6.21, in the case of any Straddle Period of a
Subsidiary, Taxes shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the amount which would be
payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date.

shall make any election under Section 338 of the Code, or other comparable
provision under state, local or foreign law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

applicable form of registration including by prospectus supplement to an

Law due to the existence of any fact or happening of any event that makes any
statement of a material fact in such registration statement, any related
prospectus or issuer free writing prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue or which would require
the making of any changes in such registration statement, prospectus or

statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case of such prospectus
or issuer free writing prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (C) is
otherwise prohibited under the Registration Rights Agreement, then Buyer shall
deliver at the Closing, in lieu of such Share Consideration, an amount in
cash equal to the Share Consideration Amount in respect of such Share
Consideration, and for purposes of this Agreement all references to the "Share
Consideration Amount" (notwithstanding any prior election made by Buyer with
respect thereto) shall mean an amount equal to Zero Dollars ($0).

actually recovered by such Indemnified Party under policies of insurance (less
any costs and expenses of recovery thereof), with respect to such Losses. If
and to the extent any insurance proceeds are actually received by any
Indemnified Party after such Indemnified Party has recovered any Losses
pursuant to this Article VIII such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to such insurance proceeds to which the
Indemnifying Party is entitled pursuant to the first sentence of this
paragraph.

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be compensated more than once
for the same Loss.

 



\- 97 - (f) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate Losses for which indemnification may be claimed by such Indemnified
Party under this Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law.

Section 8.05 Indemnification Procedures. The party making a claim under this
Article VIII is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the party against
which such claim is asserted under this Article VIII is referred to as the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ".

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such
notice of such Third Party Claim (a " _Claim Notice_ "). The failure to give a
Claim Notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that such failure
has a materially prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available
to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or the
indemnification obligations are materially increased as a result of such
failure. A Claim Notice shall describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and
shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably determinable, of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the
Claim Notice, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel
(which choice of counsel shall be subject to the Indemnified Partys prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense;
_provided_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in
writing to the Indemnified Party its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party as provided hereunder in respect thereof, (ii) the Indemnifying Party
must conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently in
order to preserve its rights in this regard and (iii) notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to elect to defend
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party
shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense) if the Third
Party Claim (A) could result in any Adverse Claim Consequences or (B) seeks
non-monetary relief, relates to a criminal action or involves claims by a
Provider or Governmental Authority. In the event that the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section
8.05(b), it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such
Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided_ ,
that (A) if the Indemnifying Party requests that the Indemnified Party
participates in the defense of such Third Party Claim or (B) if, in the
reasonable written opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (x) there are
legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (y) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party

 



\- 98 -  and the Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable documented fees and expenses of one counsel
to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party
determines counsel is required. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim or fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section 8.05(b), pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and
all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third Party Claim.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making
available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.05(a)) records relating
to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to
settle or compromise any Third Party Claim if the terms of such settlement do
not contain a release of the Indemnified Parties or (i) would result in the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party, (ii) would result in a
finding or admission of wrongdoing or violation of Law by the Indemnified
Party, (iii) would result in any monetary Liability of the Indemnified Party
that will not be paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) has a
material adverse effect on any ongoing business of the Indemnified Party (any
of the foregoing, " _Adverse Claim Consequences_ "). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not
admit any Liability with respect to, settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that such failure has a materially prejudicial effect on the
defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the
Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) calendar days
after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim.
The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to allow the Indemnified Party to investigate
the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim,
and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in

 



\- 99 -  respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall assist the
Indemnifying Partys investigation by providing reasonable access (including
access to the Indemnified Partys premises and personnel, documents or
records during normal business hours on a mutually convenient basis) as the
Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request.
If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such thirty (30)
calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected
such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 8.06 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days
of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (or, if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement, to the extent applicable).

Section 8.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by Law.

 

Section 8.08 Exclusive Remedy.

 

(a) Except in the case of Section 8.02(d) or Section 8.03(d), or claims for
equitable relief (including the enforcement of any covenant requiring
performance following the Closing), from and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy for all Losses relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article VIII.

(b) Subject in all instances to the limitations and provisions provided for in
this Article VIII, Buyer agrees that any and all amounts payable as a result
of any Third Party Claim or Direct Claim by any Buyer Indemnitee for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a) (other than in respect of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of Seller
set forth in Section 4.13 (Employment and Benefits Matters) and Section 4.14
(Taxes)) shall be paid solely from the then-remaining Escrow Funds in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any other Liability therefor, whether in indemnity or
otherwise.

 

Section 8.09 Materiality. For purposes of Section 8.02(a), Section 8.02(b),
Section 8.03(a) and Section 8.03(b), any qualifications as to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect, material adverse effect or similar qualification
contained in the representations or warranties in this Agreement (other than
with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.05(a) (third sentence) and Section 4.06(a), as to which this Section 8.09
shall not apply), shall be disregarded and have no effect for purposes of
determining whether there has been an inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty and calculating the amount of any Losses
thereunder.

 



\- 100 - ARTICLE IX

(d) by Buyer or Seller, by written notice to the other party, in the event
that:

 

(i) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Prohibitive Order
restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Prohibitive Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d)(i)

cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied (or waived) by the
Initial Termination Date, the Initial Termination Date may be extended by
either Seller or Buyer for up to two (2) months from the Initial Termination
Date (the Initial Termination Date, as it may be extended pursuant to this
Section 9.01(d)(ii), is referred to herein as the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 9.01(d)(ii) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date.

 

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with this
Article IX, this Agreement shall forthwith become void (in whole or in part,
as applicable) and there shall be no liability on the part of any Party hereto
(nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates) or any of the Financing Sources
except:

 

(i) as set forth in this Article IX, in Section 6.06 and in Article X hereof;
and

 

(ii) that subject to Section 9.02(b), nothing herein shall relieve any Party

Party in connection with, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(including with respect to the termination thereof). In the event of a
termination by either Party as contemplated by this Section 9.02(b), the non-
terminating Partys receipt of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of such party and its Affiliates against the Terminating
Party and any of its Affiliates and any of the Financing Sources for any and
all Losses that may be suffered based upon, resulting from or arising out of
the circumstances giving rise to such termination, and none of the terminating

Agreement acknowledge the agreements contained in this Section 9.02(b), are

Agreement, and that the payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, does
not constitute a penalty.

writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar

State of New York.

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN
CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT,
THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY (WITHOUT LIMITING SECTION 10.12, INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF
DOUBT, ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE) MAY ONLY BE INSTITUTED IN THE
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF
MANHATTAN, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS,
SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH
HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD
OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY

TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE FINANCING
OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO). EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION,
(ii) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) SUCH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10(c).

 

Section 10.11 Specific Performance. Without intending to limit the remedies
available to the Parties hereunder, the Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof, for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms hereof, without, in any such
case, the requirement to post any bond or other undertaking, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party
agrees not to oppose the granting of such injunctive relief on the basis that
monetary damages are an adequate remedy.

 

Section 10.12 Non-Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Seller agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and
their Representatives that none of the Financing Sources shall have any
liability or obligation to the Seller or any of its or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives relating to this Agreement, any
commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including with respect to
the Financing). The Seller and its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives hereby waive any and all rights or claims and causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
the Financing Sources that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing
document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including
the Financing or the Commitment Letter), and each of Seller and its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives agrees not to commence or support an Action
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or any
commitment letter, engagement letter or

 



\- 107 -  definitive financing document or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (including any Action relating to the Financing or the Commitment
Letter). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is
