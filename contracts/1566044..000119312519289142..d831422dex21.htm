ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with Sections 314 through 327 of the Israeli
Companies Law5759-1999 (the " _Companies Law_ "), at the Effective Time (as
defined in _Section_ __ _ 1.2_), Menlo Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Foamix. As a result of the Merger: (a) the separate corporate existence
of Menlo Merger Sub (as the target company, or _Chevrat Ha_ __ _Ya_ __ _ad_
) shall cease and Foamix (as the absorbing company, or _HaChevra Ha_ __
_Koletet_ ) shall continue as the surviving entity following the Merger
(sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Company_ "); and (b) Foamix
shall (i) become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Menlo, (ii) continue to be
governed by the Laws of the State of Israel, (iii) have a registered office in
the State of Israel, and (iv) succeed to and assume all of the rights,
properties and obligations of Menlo Merger Sub and Foamix in accordance with
the Companies Law and the existing shareholders of Foamix shall be entitled to
Merger Consideration (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ below) in
accordance with the provisions of _Article II_ of this Agreement.

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 7:00
a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction

 



2

    

 or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in _Article_ __ _ VI_ hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the
occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New
York, New York 10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on or immediately prior to the Closing Date, each of Foamix and
Menlo Merger Sub shall (and Menlo shall cause Menlo Merger Sub to), in
coordination with each other, inform the Registrar of Companies of the State
of Israel (the " _Israeli Registrar of Companies_ ") that all conditions to
the Merger under the Companies Law and this Agreement have been met (together
with any other documentation required to be submitted to the Israeli Registrar
of Companies, whether under this Agreement or the Merger Proposal, by the
Israeli Companies Registrar or otherwise) and setting forth the proposed date
on which the Merger shall become effective and on which the Israeli Registrar
of Companies is requested to issue a certificate evidencing the Merger in
accordance with Section 323(5) of the Companies Law (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance by the Israeli
Registrar of Companies of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Section
323(5) of the Companies Law (the time at which the Merger becomes effective
is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, it is the intention of the parties that the Merger shall be declared
effective and that the issuance by the Israeli Registrar of Companies of the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of the Companies Law
shall both occur on the Closing Date or the immediately following Business
Day.

 

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and as specified in the applicable provisions of the
Companies Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall succeed to all the
rights and properties and the business of each of Menlo Merger Sub
and Foamix, and shall assume all of the debts, claims, liabilities and
obligations of each of Menlo Merger Sub and Foamix. Menlo Merger Sub will
cease to exist and will be stricken from the records of the Israeli Registrar
of Companies, and Foamix will become a private company wholly owned
(including with respect to any warrants, options or other securities) directly
by Menlo, all as provided under the Companies Law.

Effective Time, the articles of association of Foamix shall be amended and
restated in their entity to read as set forth in _Exhibit 1.4_ , and as so

articles of association of the Surviving Company (the " _Surviving Company
Articles_ ") until thereafter amended as provided by applicable Law and such
articles of association.

Section 1.5  _Directors and Officers_.

(a) _Directors and Officers of Menlo_.

 

(i) Menlo shall cause, effective as of the Effective Time, (i) the Menlo Board
to consist of seven (7) individuals, which shall consist of five (5)

_Foamix Designee_ ") and two (2) directors selected by Menlo Board (at least
one (1) of whom shall be independent) (each, a " _Menlo Designee_ "), (ii)
both such Menlo Designees and one Foamix Designee to each be appointed to the
Menlo Board as a Class I director with a term ending at the 2022 annual

each Menlo Designee, the

 



3

    

 committees on which each such Foamix Designee and Menlo Designee shall serve
and shall select a Chairman of the Board and Committee Chairpersons from the
Foamix Designees and Menlo Designees. In the event any Foamix Designee or any
Menlo Designee is not a member of the Foamix Board or the Menlo Board,
respectively, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each of Foamix and
Menlo shall be entitled to replace such Foamix Designee or Menlo Designee, as
the case may be, with a another individual serving on the Foamix Board (in the
case of a Foamix Designee) or Menlo Board (in the case of a Menlo Designee)
immediately prior to the Effective Time to serve as a director in place of
the individual originally selected (the " _Substitute Designee_ ");
_provided_ , that, in the case of a Substitute Designee selected by Foamix,
such Substitute Designee shall be reasonably acceptable to Menlo, and in the
case of a Substitute Designee selected by Menlo, such Substitute Designee
shall be reasonably acceptable to Foamix. In the event that either of the
Menlo Designees becomes unable to serve as a member of the Menlo Board
following the Effective Time and resigns therefrom prior to the 2022 annual
meeting of Menlo, then the Menlo Board shall fill the vacancy as a result of
such resigning Menlo Designee with an individual designated by the remaining
Menlo Designee, provided such individual previously served on the Menlo Board
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is satisfactory to the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of the Menlo Board.

 

(ii) Immediately following the Effective Time, Menlo shall take all necessary
action to appoint the officers of Foamix to become the equivalent officers of
Menlo until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

 

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_.

 

(i) The Parties shall take all actions necessary (i) so that from and after

Surviving Company, if any.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, the officers of Foamix immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

2.1(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_ hereof, each Foamix Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to

(i) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Menlo (the " _Menlo Common Stock_ ")
equal to 0.5924 shares of Menlo Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); and

Stock Right, together with the shares of Menlo Common Stock referred to
in clause (i) above, being referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_
").

As of the Effective Time, (a) all Foamix Shares, pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_, shall be deemed transferred under Israeli Law to Menlo, and
each holder of a Certificate (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_) or Book-
Entry Share which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
Foamix Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Menlo Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, in each
case without interest, and less, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_, any

is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically and without further action converted into one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share with a par value of NIS 1.00 per share, of
the Surviving Company, and the shares of the Surviving Company into which the
shares of Menlo Merger Sub Shares are so converted shall be the only shares of
the Surviving Company that are issued and outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Menlo Merger Sub Shares shall evidence ownership of
such shares of the Surviving Company.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each Foamix Share, if any, that is a
dormant share (or _menayah redumah_ ) under Israeli Law and each Foamix Share
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is owned by Foamix, Menlo or
Menlo Merger Sub or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Foamix or Menlo or Menlo Merger Sub, shall be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist without any conversion, and no consideration shall be
delivered in respect thereof.

(d) _Foamix Equity Awards_.

 

(i) _Foamix RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
award relating to Foamix Shares granted under any Foamix Equity Plan (each, a
" _Foamix RSU Award_ ") that remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Menlo and converted into a
restricted stock unit award of Menlo (each, an " _Adjusted RSU Award_ ") that
settles in the number of shares of Menlo Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the number of Foamix Shares subject to the Foamix RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, which Adjusted RSU
Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Foamix RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including vesting and the current Tax Track, assuming that all the
conditions of such Tax Track are met and subject to the provisions of the
Options Tax Ruling (if applicable)). In the event that following the
Effective Time any Contingent Stock Right is converted into Menlo Common Stock
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contingent
Stock Rights Agreement, each individual who held an outstanding Foamix RSU
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of conversion of the applicable Contingent
Stock Rights, be entitled to receive, in respect of each such Foamix RSU
Award, an additional restricted stock unit award (each, a " _Contingent RSU
Award_ ") that settles in the number of shares of Menlo Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the number of Foamix Shares subject to such Foamix RSU Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of
Menlo Common Stock (or fraction thereof) that a holder of a Foamix Share would
have received upon conversion of a Contingent

 



5

    

 Stock Right. Each Contingent RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions applicable to the Foamix RSU Award in respect of which such
Contingent RSU Award is granted (including vesting and Tax Track, assuming
that all the conditions of Tax Track are met and subject to the provisions of
the Options Tax Ruling (if applicable)).

 

(ii) _Foamix Stock Options_. As of the Effective Time, each compensatory
option to purchase Foamix Shares granted under any Foamix Equity Plan (each,
a " _Foamix Stock Option_ ") that remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be assumed by Menlo and converted into a compensatory option to purchase,
shares of Menlo Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ "), on the same
terms and conditions (including vesting and the current Tax Track, assuming
that all the conditions of such Tax Track are met and subject to the
provisions of the Options Tax Ruling (if applicable)) as were applicable under
such Foamix Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
any changes that are required solely to reflect the conversion of such Foamix
Stock Option to an Adjusted Option, relating to the number of shares of Menlo
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to (x)
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Foamix Shares
subject to such Foamix Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Exchange Ratio and the exercise price per share of such Adjusted
Option shall be an amount equal to the quotient of the exercise price per
Foamix Share subject to such Foamix Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents
rounded up to the next higher number of whole cents. In the event that
following the Effective Time, any Contingent Stock Right is converted into
Menlo Common Stock pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement, the Menlo Board shall, as soon as
practicable following the date of the conversion of the applicable Contingent
Stock Rights, make such equitable adjustments to the exercise price per share
of, and the number of shares of Menlo Common Stock subject to, any Adjusted
Option that is outstanding on the date of the conversion of such Contingent
Stock Rights as the Menlo Board determines to be necessary to account for the
payment or issuance of such Contingent Stock Rights. The exercise price per
share of any such Adjusted Option and the number of shares of Menlo Common
Stock relating to any such Adjusted Option will be determined and adjusted,
as applicable, in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 102 of
the Ordinance, Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Foamix Stock
Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of
Section 424 of the Code, as applicable.

 

(iii) _Foamix ESPP; Menlo ESPP_.

 

(A) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)(iii)(D)_, as of the Effective Time,
Menlo shall assume Foamixs 2019 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the " _Foamix
ESPP_ "), and the Foamix ESPP shall continue in effect in accordance with its
terms following the Effective Time; provided that, each outstanding Purchase
Right (as defined in the Foamix ESPP) (a " _Foamix Purchase Right_ ") that
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a purchase
right in respect of Menlo Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Purchase Right_
"), on the same terms and conditions (including the current Tax Track,
assuming that all the conditions of such Tax Track are met and subject to the
provisions of the Options Tax Ruling (if applicable)) as were applicable
under such Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for
any changes that are required solely to reflect the conversion of such
Purchase Right to an Adjusted Purchase Right, relating to the number of
shares of Menlo Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Foamix
Shares subject to such Purchase Right immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (B) the Exchange Ratio.

(B) Prior to the Effective Time, Foamix shall take all action that may be
necessary to: (A) cause any outstanding offering period (or similar period
during which Foamix Shares may be purchased) under the Foamix ESPP to be
terminated as of the last business day prior to the date on

  



6

    

 which the Merger becomes effective (the last business day prior to the date
on which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the " _Designated
Date_ "); (B) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the Foamix ESPP; and (C)
cause the exercise as of the Designated Date of each outstanding purchase
right under the Foamix ESPP; _provided_ , __ that the actions described in
clauses "(A)" through "(C)" of this sentence shall be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Merger. On the Designated Date, Foamix shall apply the
funds credited as of such date under the Foamix ESPP within each participants
payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole Foamix Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Foamix ESPP.

(C) Following the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.1(d)(iii)(D), Menlo
shall continue to maintain the Foamix ESPP (as may be amended or terminated
from time to time in accordance with its terms), and shall be able to grant
"incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) under the Foamix ESPP. As of
immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) the maximum number of shares of
Foamix Shares that may be issued under the Foamix ESPP upon the exercise of
incentive stock options (including outstanding grants) is 5,400,000 (subject
to certain adjustments in accordance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder) and (ii) employees of Foamix are eligible to receive incentive
stock options under the Foamix ESPP. As of immediately following the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Mergers, (i) the maximum number of shares of Menlo
Common Stock that may be issued under the Foamix ESPP as incentive stock
options (including outstanding grants) shall be 5,400,000 (subject to certain
adjustments (x) in the applicable plan in accordance with the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) to reflect the Exchange Ratio) and
(ii) employees of Menlo and its subsidiaries (including following the
Surviving Corporation following the Closing) shall be eligible to receive
incentive stock options under the Foamix ESPP.

 

(D) At least five (5) days prior to the Closing, Foamix may, or may direct
Menlo to, take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to
terminate, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (and
subject to the Closing), the Foamix ESPP and/or the Menlo ESPP. In the event
that Foamix directs Menlo to terminate the Menlo ESPP, Menlo shall provide to
Foamix prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Menlo
Board of resolutions authorizing the termination of the Menlo ESPP (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review
of Foamix), and Menlo also shall take, prior to the Effective Time, such
other actions in furtherance of terminating the Menlo ESPP as Foamix may
reasonably request in writing.

 

(iv) _Menlo Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Menlo shall take all
actions necessary for the assumption of the Adjusted RSU Awards, Adjusted
Options, Adjusted Purchase Rights and the treatment thereof pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_, including the reservation, issuance and listing of a
number of shares of Menlo Common Stock as necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than two (2)
business days following the Effective Time, Menlo shall file a registration
statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8, Form S-3 or another
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) with respect to the shares of Menlo Common Stock subject to
each such award under the Foamix Equity Plans and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such awards
remain outstanding. As soon as practicable after the registration of such
shares of Menlo Common Stock, Menlo shall deliver to the holders of the
Adjusted RSU Awards, Adjusted Options and Adjusted Purchase Rights appropriate
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Foamix
Equity Plans and

 



7

    

 agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted
Options, and stating that such Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted Options and
agreements have been assumed by Menlo and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(d)_).

 

(v) _Foamix Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, Foamix shall take all
action necessary for the treatment of the Foamix RSU Awards, Foamix Stock
Options and Foamix Purchase Rights in accordance with _Sections 2.1(d)(i)_ ,
_2.1(d)(ii)_ and _2.1(d)(iii)_ , respectively.

 

(e) _Conversion of Foamix Warrants_. All Foamix Warrants outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, subject to any applicable
withholding pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_, be converted into warrants to
purchase shares of Menlo Common Stock, in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.20_. Prior to the Effective Time, Foamix shall take all action necessary
for the treatment of the Foamix Warrants in accordance with this _Section_ __
_ 2.1(e)_.

(f)  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Menlo Common Stock will
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof Menlo shall pay to each
holder of Foamix Shares who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Menlo Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Menlo
Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder (other than those
that would be received pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(e)_)), upon surrender
of such holders Certificate(s) (if issued to such holder), an amount of cash
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product
of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Menlo Common Stock Value. "
_Menlo Common Stock Value_ " means the average of the closing sale prices of
Menlo Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") as reported by
_The Wall Street Journal_ for the ten (10) full trading days ending on the
last trading day preceding the Closing Date. No fraction of a share of Menlo
Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of any Contingent Stock Right
pursuant to the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement and in lieu of such
fractional shares, an amount in cash shall be paid to the holder of such
Contingent Stock Right pursuant to the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement. The
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Menlo Common Stock pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ and the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement is
not a separately bargained-for consideration.

 

(g) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_.

 

(i) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Menlo Common Stock or
Foamix Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Menlo Common Stock or Foamix Shares having a
record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. In
the event the Exchange Ratio is adjusted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.1(g)(i)_, the replacement Exchange Ratios referenced in Section
2.1(g)(ii)(B) and (C) and in Section 7(b)(i)(1) and (2) of the Contingent
Stock Rights Agreement shall be adjusted to reflect such adjustment.

 

(ii) In addition, if, prior to the Effective Time: (A) the Efficacy
Determination is delivered to Foamix and Menlo on or before May 31, 2020; or
(B) if the Efficacy Determination is not delivered to Foamix and Menlo on or
before May 31, 2020, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted as follows:

 

(A) If the Efficacy Determination reports that Serlopitant Significance was
achieved in both Phase III PN Trials on or before May 31, 2020, then there
shall be no adjustment to the Exchange Ratio and no Contingent Stock Rights
shall be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_;

 

(B) If the Efficacy Determination reports that (1) Serlopitant Significance
was achieved in only one Phase III PN Trial on or before May 31, 2020 and (2)
Serlopitant Significance was not achieved or has not been determined in each
case on or before May 31, 2020 in the other Phase III PN Trial, then the
Exchange Ratio shall instead be 1.2739 shares of Menlo Common Stock and no
Contingent Stock Rights shall be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)_; and

 



8

    

(C) If the Efficacy Determination reports that Serlopitant Significance
was not achieved in both Phase III PN Trials or the Efficacy Determination
has not been delivered on or before May 31, 2020, then in each case the
Exchange Ratio shall instead be 1.8006 shares of Menlo Common Stock and no
Contingent Stock Rights shall be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)_.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_. 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Menlo and Foamix shall
engage a nationally-recognized financial institution to be mutually agreed
upon to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (which may use a
local Israeli sub-paying agent) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the
Effective Time, Menlo shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Foamix Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and to the extent required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)(iii)_, in
the Exchange Agents name, for exchange in accordance with this _Article_ __
_ II_, through the Exchange Agent, certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing the shares of Menlo Common Stock issuable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 2.1(a)_ and any dividends or distributions to which holders of Foamix
Shares may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_. All cash and Menlo
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_." Promptly following the Effective Time, Menlo
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, cash with the Exchange Agent in an
amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)._

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time, Menlo shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Foamix Shares
(the " _Certificates_ ") or Book Entry Shares, which at the Effective Time
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Menlo may reasonably specify), (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_,
and (iii) __ a duly completed and validly executed declaration and/or
Qualified Tax Certificate (or such other forms as may be required under any
applicable Tax law, the 104H Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim Ruling, and each in
such form as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, or such forms
as prescribed in the Withholding Tax Ruling) in which the beneficial owner of
Foamix Shares provides certain information necessary for the Exchange Agent to
determine whether any amounts need to be withheld from the consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable to such beneficial owner hereunder pursuant
to the terms of the Ordinance (in each case, subject to the terms of the
Withholding Tax Ruling). Upon (A) in the case of Foamix Shares represented by
a Certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent; or (B) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together with the letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, including a duly completed and validly executed
declaration and/or Qualified Tax Certificate or such other forms as may be
required under any applicable Tax law, the 104H Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim
Ruling, or such forms as prescribed in the Withholding Tax Ruling, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor such number of whole shares of Menlo
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form), payment, subject to any
applicable withholding tax pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_, in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_, any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ and Contingent Stock Rights, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The

 



9

    

 Contingent Stock Rights shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other
instrument. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Foamix Shares which is
not registered in the transfer records of Foamix, certificates representing
the proper amount of Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, payment in the form of or with respect to the Contingent Stock Rights)
may be issued to a Person (as defined in  _Section_ __ _ 8.14(vv)_) other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Menlo Common Stock
and Contingent Stock Rights to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Menlo that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable and subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.2(h)_. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts
to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_)
upon such surrender No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any amount
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
a Book-Entry Share shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent in order to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and any cash pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ upon such surrender. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and any cash that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or  _Section_ __ _
2.2(c)_ in respect of such Book-Entry Shares shall upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or such other
evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled
to receive, and Menlo shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, subject to any
applicable withholding tax pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_, the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.1_ and any cash that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Menlo Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Menlo Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ hereof, until such
Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_.
No dividends or other distributions shall be paid or made in respect of any
Contingent Stock Right except following conversion of any Contingent Stock
Right into shares of Menlo Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
Contingent Stock Rights Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Foamix Shares with a record date prior to the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i)
promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Menlo Common
Stock and Contingent Stock Rights issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to
this _Article_ __ _ II_, together with any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Menlo Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Menlo Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Menlo Common Stock,
less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be required thereon.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Foamix Shares_. All shares of Menlo Common
Stock and Contingent Stock Rights issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or to the holders of Book-Entry

 



10

    

 Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ and any cash
paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to Foamix Shares previously represented by such Certificates. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Foamix shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company of Foamix Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article_ __ _ II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Certificates and Book-Entry Shares to be exchanged by any Person
constituting an "affiliate" of Foamix for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") thereunder (the "
_Securities Act_ "), shall be subject to the restrictions described in such
Rule 145.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Milestone Date (as
defined in the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement) or, in the event the Merger
Consideration is adjusted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(g)(ii)_, one (1)
year after the Effective Time, shall be delivered to Menlo, upon demand, and
any holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this  _Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter look only to Menlo
for satisfaction of its claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Menlo Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_
and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Menlo, Menlo Merger Sub, Foamix or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Menlo Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), Contingent Stock Rights
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time,
or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Menlo Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Menlo Common Stock, Contingent
Stock Rights or any dividends or distributions with respect to Menlo Common
Stock issuable in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section_ __ _
3.6_), any such shares, Contingent Stock Rights, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Menlo on a daily basis;
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former shareholders of Foamix after the Effective Time pursuant to
this _Article_ __ _ II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall promptly be
paid to Menlo.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_.

 

(i) Foamix, the Exchange Agent, the 102 Trustee, Menlo, the Surviving Company
and any other Person who has any obligation to deduct or withhold from any
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement (each such Person, a "
_Withholding Agent_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the
Ordinance, the Withholding Tax Ruling, a Qualified Tax Certificate, the
Options Tax Ruling, the Interim Options Tax Ruling, the 104H Tax Ruling and
the 104H Interim Ruling, any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax law or under any applicable Laws (as reasonably determined in the
good faith discretion of the applicable Withholding Agent), and shall be
provided any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series
of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, all in the form
included in

 



11

    

 the letter of transmittal. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid and the
Withholding Agent shall furnish as promptly as practicable such Person with a
documentation evidencing such Tax withholding.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)(i)_ above
and subject to any other provision to the contrary in the Withholding Tax
Ruling, the 104H Tax Ruling or 104H Interim Ruling with respect to Israeli
Tax, and in accordance with the Exchange Agent undertaking provided to Menlo
prior to the Closing Date by the Exchange Agent, pursuant to Section 6.2.4.3
of the Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale of Rights in a
Corporation that includes Consideration that will be transferred to the Seller
at Future Dates) (the " _Exchange Agent Undertaking_ "), the Merger
Consideration payable or otherwise deliverable hereunder to each of the
holders of Foamix Shares , Foamix Stock Options, Foamix Purchase Rights,
Foamix RSUs and/or Foamix Warrants (in each case, other than holders of 102
Securities) (each, a " _Securityholder_ ") shall be transferred to, and
retained by, the Exchange Agent for the respective benefit of each
Securityholder for a period of 180 days from Closing (including with respect
to any consideration deliverable to the Securityholder as a result of any
adjustment pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(g)_ or under the Contingent Stock
Rights Agreement, from the date on which such consideration becomes
deliverable to such Securityholder) or an earlier date required in writing by
a Securityholder or the ITA (the " _Withholding Drop Date_ "), during which
time the Exchange Agent shall not withhold any Israeli Tax on such Merger
Consideration except as provided below. During such period, each
Securityholder may obtain a certification or ruling or any other written
instructions regarding Tax withholdings issued by the ITA, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, that is applicable to
the payments or other consideration to be made to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement stating that no withholding, or reduced withholding, of any Israeli
Tax is required with respect to such payment or other consideration or
providing any other instructions regarding Tax withholdings (the " _Qualified
Withholding Certificate_ "). Where a Securityholder submits a Qualified
Withholding Certificate to the Exchange Agent no later than three (3) Business
Days before the Withholding Drop Date, the Exchange Agent shall withhold and
timely transfer to the ITA an amount from the Securityholders portion of the
Merger Consideration as specified in the Qualified Withholding Certificate. To
the extent that the Exchange Agent is obliged to withhold Israeli Taxes, the
Securityholder shall provide the Exchange Agent with the amount due with
regards to such Israeli Taxes, within seven (7) Business Days from receipt of
a request from the Exchange Agent to make such payment, and in any event
prior to the release of the Merger Consideration deliverable to the
Securityholder. In the event that the Securityholder fails to provide the
Exchange Agent with the full amount necessary to satisfy such Israeli
Taxes within such timeframe, the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to sell the
Securityholders retained Menlo Common Stock to the extent necessary to
satisfy the full amount due with regards to such Israeli Taxes. In the event
that the Exchange Agent receives a demand from the ITA to withhold any amount
out of the Merger Consideration payable to any of the Securityholders and
transfer it to the ITA prior to the Withholding Drop Date, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly notify such Securityholders of the demand, and provide such
Securityholders with reasonable time (but in no event less than 30 days,
unless otherwise explicitly required in writing by the ITA or under any
applicable Law) to attempt to delay such requirement or extend the period for
complying with such requirement as evidenced by a written certificate, ruling
or confirmation from the ITA, in which time the Merger Consideration
deliverable shall not be released to such Securityholders. To the extent that
any such certificate, ruling or confirmation is not timely provided by such
recipient to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall transfer to the ITA
any amount so demanded, including any interest, indexation and fines required
by the ITA in respect thereof, following receipt of such amount from
Securityholder or sale of such Securityholders retained Menlo Common Stock to
the extent necessary to satisfy the full amount due with regards to such
Israeli Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to any other provision
in the Withholding Tax Ruling, the 104H Tax Ruling and 104H Interim Ruling, if
the Exchange Agent

 



12

    

 Undertaking is provided to Menlo prior to the Closing Date, then no
Securityholder shall be required to provide a Withholding Agent with a
Qualified Withholding Certificate (and thus no withholding of Tax shall
apply) with respect to the Securityholders respective portion of the Exchange
Fund, until the actual delivery of such consideration or any portions thereof
is made to the Securityholder, in which case any applicable withholding will
be calculated and administered as provided above and timely delivered to the
ITA.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject
to any other provision to the contrary in the Withholding Tax Ruling, the 104H
Tax Ruling or 104H Interim Ruling with respect to Israeli Tax, until a
Securityholder presents to the Exchange Agent a Qualified Withholding
Certificate or evidence satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that the full
applicable Tax amount with respect to such recipient, as reasonably determined
by the Exchange Agent, is withheld, any certificates of Menlo Common Stock
issuable to such recipient shall be issued only in the name of the Exchange
Agent to be held in trust for the relevant recipient and delivered to such
recipient in compliance with the withholding requirements under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_.

(iv) Each Person hereby waives, releases and absolutely and forever
discharges Menlo, the Exchange Agent or anyone acting on their behalf from
and against any and all claims for any losses in connection with the
forfeiture or sale of any portion of the shares of Menlo Common Stock
otherwise deliverable to such Person in compliance with the withholding
requirements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(h)_. To the extent that the
Exchange Agent is unable, for whatever reason, to sell the applicable portion
of shares of Menlo Common Stock required to finance applicable deduction or
withholding requirements, then the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to hold
all of the shares of Menlo Common Stock otherwise deliverable to the
applicable Person until the earlier of: (a) the receipt of a Qualified
Withholding Certificate from the Person fully exempting the Exchange Agent
from tax withholding; or (b) such time when the Exchange Agent is able to sell
the portion of such shares of Menlo Common Stock otherwise deliverable to
such Person that is required to enable the Exchange Agent to comply with such
applicable deduction or withholding requirements. Any costs or expenses
incurred by the relevant Exchange Agent in connection with such sale shall be
borne by, and deducted from the payment to, the applicable Person.

(i) _102 Options Tax Ruling_. Foamix, through its legal and accounting
representatives in cooperation with Menlo, through its legal and accounting
representatives, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement will
approach the ITA with an application for a ruling (the " _Options Tax Ruling_
") in relation to the tax treatment of 102 Securities under this Agreement to
confirm, among other things, that (A) the treatment of assumption of the 102
Options and exchange of 102 Common Stock will not be treated as a taxable
event and that tax continuity shall apply to the Adjusted RSUs, Adjusted
Options and Adjusted Purchase Rights, including specific reference to the
taxation of the Contingent Rights issued with respect to each type of award;
provided that the applicable consideration paid to holders of 102 Securities
is deposited at least until the end of the duration of the 102 Trust Period
with the 102 Trustee; (B) Menlo and anyone acting on its behalf, including the
Exchange Agent and the 102 Trustee, shall be exempt from withholding Tax in
relation to any payments or consideration transferred to the 102 Trustee in
relation to 102 Securities; (C) that distributions from the Exchange Fund in
respect of 102 Common Stock and 102 Options shall not be subject to Israeli
Tax until actually received by the applicable Securityholder, and shall
include such additional terms as are customary to be included in such rulings.
Foamix shall request in the Options Tax Ruling an exemption for the
Withholding Agent(s) and their respective agents from any withholding
obligation. If the Options Tax Ruling is not granted prior to the Closing,
Foamix shall seek to receive prior to the Closing an interim Tax ruling
confirming among others that Menlo and anyone acting on its behalf will be
exempt from Israeli withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with
respect to 102 Securities to the 102 Trustee (which ruling may be subject to
customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (such a ruling,
the " _Interim Options Tax Ruling_ "). Menlo and Foamix shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate with each other
with respect to the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may
be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Options Tax Ruling or the
Interim Options Tax Ruling, as applicable. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, Foamix

 



13

    

 will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law to obtain the Interim Options Tax Ruling
and the Options Tax Ruling as promptly as practicable. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Options Tax Ruling and, if applicable, the Interim Options Tax
Ruling shall be subject to the prior review of Menlo or its legal counsel
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Each of the Options Tax Ruling and the Interim Options Tax Ruling shall be
considered a Qualified Withholding Certificate.

 

(j) _104H and Withholding Tax Ruling_. Foamix and Securityholders who are
subject to Israeli taxation and receive shares of Menlo Common Stock or
Menlos restricted stock as consideration for their Foamix Shares may prepare
and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (or 104H Interim Ruling)
permitting any holder of Foamix Shares who elects to become a party to such a
Tax ruling (each, an " _Electing Holder_ "), to defer any applicable Israeli
Tax, if applied, with respect to such stock consideration that such Electing
Holder will receive pursuant to this Agreement until the sale, transfer or
other conveyance for cash of such share portion of the consideration by such
Electing Holder or such other date set forth in Section 104H of the Ordinance
(the " _104H Tax Ruling_ "). Menlo shall cooperate with Foamix, the
Electing Holders and their Israeli counsel with respect to the preparation
and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the 104H Tax
Ruling; provided that any costs associated with the application for the 104H
Tax Ruling shall be paid by Foamix prior to the Closing; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the 104H Interim Ruling or the 104H Tax Ruling shall not
impose any material restrictions or obligations with respect to the
activities of Menlo or any affiliate thereof or the Surviving Company. Upon
the obtaining of the 104H Tax Ruling, Menlo, Foamix and the Exchange Agent and
each Electing Holder shall furnish to the ITA a customary approval letter of
the terms of such ruling; and provided further that that if none of such
rulings is obtained for any reason whatsoever by the Closing Date, the Closing
will not be delayed or postponed. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(j)_, if the 104H Tax Ruling or the 104H Interim Ruling
shall be received and delivered to Menlo at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the applicable withholding date, then, subject to the provisions
of the Withholding Tax Ruling, the provisions of the 104H Tax Ruling shall
apply with respect to each Electing Holder and all applicable withholding and
reporting procedures with respect to their consideration shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the 104H Interim Ruling and 104H Tax
Ruling, as applicable, and Section 104H of the Ordinance. For the avoidance of
doubt, Foamix and the Electing Holders shall not make any application to the
ITA with respect to any matter relating to the 104H Tax Ruling without first
consulting with Menlos Israeli legal counsel and granting Menlos Israeli
legal counsel the opportunity to review, comment and approve the draft
application, and Foamix and the Electing Holders and any representatives
thereof shall enable Menlos Israeli legal counsel to participate in all
material discussions and meetings with the ITA relating thereto. To the extent
that Menlos Israeli legal counsel elect not to participate in any such
meeting or discussion, then Foamix, the Electing Holders and/or their Israeli
legal counsel shall provide Menlos Israeli legal counsel an update of the
discussions and/or meetings held with the ITA. The final text of the 104H
Interim Ruling or the 104H Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior written
confirmation of Menlo or its Israeli legal counsel. Each of the 104H Tax
Ruling or the 104H Interim Ruling, if obtained, shall be considered as a
Qualified Withholding Certificate.

(k) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, Foamix
shall instruct its Israeli legal counsel, advisors or accountants to, in
coordination with Menlo and its Israeli legal counsel, advisors and
accountants, prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling (i)
with respect to Securityholders that are non-Israeli residents (as defined in

this Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, or clarifying that no
such obligation exists, or (B) clearly instructing Menlo, the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Company and their respective agents on how such withholding at
the source is to be executed, and in particular, with respect to the classes
or categories of Securityholders from which Tax is to be withheld (if any),
the rate or rates of withholding to be applied and how to identify any such
non-Israeli residents; (ii) with respect to Securityholders that are Israeli
residents (as defined in the Ordinance or as will be

 determined by the ITA in the Withholding Tax Ruling) (other than Foamixs

has not been satisfied in full (other than any liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice all of which have been timely paid) and

material Liability to Foamix. Foamix has not been required to post any

any current or former employee, officer or director of Foamix or the Foamix
Subsidiary, other than (1) where the full cost of such benefit is borne
entirely by the employee, officer or director (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or (2) where the benefit is required by Section 4980B of the
Code.

reasonably be expected to have a Foamix Material Adverse Effect, each Foamix
Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its

 



27

    

 terms and applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, and all material
contributions, including participant contributions, and benefit payments
required under each Foamix Benefit Plan have been made in full on a timely
and proper basis pursuant to the terms of such Foamix Benefit Plan and
applicable Law. Each Foamix Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely
upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Foamix
Material Adverse Effect, there are no circumstances or any events that have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status of any such Foamix Benefit Plan.

reasonably be expected to have a Foamix Material Adverse Effect, there are no
pending or, to Foamixs Knowledge, threatened claims by, on behalf of or
against any Foamix Benefit Plan that could result in any liability to Foamix
or the Foamix Subsidiary.

 

(g) Each Foamix Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined under Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code. No Foamix
Benefit Plan provides for any reimbursement of any penalty, additional income
or excise Taxes incurred under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code. 

(h) Except as has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Foamix Material Adverse Effect, (i) each
Foamix Benefit Plan that is not subject to U.S. Law (each, a " _Foamix Foreign
Benefit Plan_ ") has been established, maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and applicable Laws and, if intended to qualify for
special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such treatment, (ii) all
employer and employee contributions to each Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan
required by its terms or by applicable Law have been made or, if
applicable, accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practices in the applicable jurisdiction applied to such matters and (iii)
with respect to each Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan that is required or intended
to be funded or book reserved, the aggregate of the fair market value of the
assets of such Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any such Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance, the book
reserve established for such Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan and any accrued
contributions with respect to such Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan, is sufficient
to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in
such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently
used to determine employer contributions to such Foamix Foreign Benefit Plan,
and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement nor
compliance with the terms hereof will (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any Foamix
Participant, (ii) increase any compensation or benefits otherwise payable to
any Foamix Participant under any Foamix Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any compensation or
benefits to any Foamix Participant under any Foamix Benefit Plan or (iv)
result in the payment or provision of any amount or benefit that could,
individually or in combination with any other payment or benefit, constitute
an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

Section 3.16 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Neither Foamix nor the Foamix Subsidiary are or have during the past three
(3) years been a party to, nor bound by, any labor agreement, collective
bargaining agreement, work rules or practices, or any other labor-related
agreements or arrangements with any labor union, trade union or other labor
organization or works council; and there are no labor agreements,
collective bargaining agreements or any other labor-related agreements that
pertain to any of the employees of Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary. As of the
date hereof, no employees of Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary are represented
by any labor organization with respect to their

of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each
as in effect on the date so filed, except to the extent updated, amended,
restated or corrected by a subsequent Menlo SEC Report filed or furnished to
the SEC by Menlo, and in either case, publicly available prior to the date
hereof (each, a " _Menlo Filed SEC Report_ "). None of the Menlo SEC Reports
(including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein) contained when filed or currently contains, and any Menlo
SEC Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected
by a subsequent Menlo Filed SEC Report.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Menlo Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements included in
the Menlo SEC Reports, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as
filed with the SEC (those filed with the SEC are collectively referred to as
the " _Menlo Financial Statements_ "), comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules of
the SEC with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of the unaudited statements,
as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which

Material Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets (including the
related notes) included in such Menlo Financial Statements (if applicable, as
updated, amended, restated or

 



39

    

 corrected in a subsequent Menlo Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Menlo and Menlo
Merger Sub at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows (in each case, including
the related notes) included in such Menlo Financial Statements (if applicable,

of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows of Menlo and Menlo Merger

reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of Menlo (or disclosed in
the notes to such balance sheet).

 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Menlo and the principal
financial officer of Menlo (or each former principal executive officer of
Menlo and each former principal financial officer of Menlo, as applicable) has
made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to the Menlo SEC Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and accurate. Menlo does not have any outstanding, and has not
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(i) Menlo maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Menlos assets.

(ii) Menlos "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Menlo in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Menlos management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Menlo required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(iii) Menlo is not a party to, and has no commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract,
including any contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among Menlo and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of
such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Menlo in Menlos published financial statements or
other Menlo SEC Reports.

(iv) Since December 31, 2018, Menlo has not received any oral or written
notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness" in
Menlos internal control over financial reporting. There is no outstanding

accountants certify has not been appropriately and adequately remedied by
Menlo.

requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions

contingent); _provided_ , that, in no event shall any plan or arrangement
that is required to be established, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by
Menlo under applicable Law without discretion by Menlo as to the level of
benefits provided constitute a Menlo Benefit Plan.

 

(b) Menlo has made available to Foamix true and complete copies of, to the

such Menlo Benefit Plan and applicable Law. Each Menlo Benefit Plan that is
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or
is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, except

(a) Menlo shall give prompt notice to Foamix and Foamix shall give prompt
notice to Menlo, as the case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur,
of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to
cause (a)(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in this

representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be

to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that failure to give
notice under the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) shall not be deemed to be a
breach of covenant under this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ and shall constitute only
a breach of the underlying representation, covenant, condition or agreement,
as the case may be. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.4_ will not limit or otherwise affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the remedies available

obligation to consummate the Merger.

parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, all
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices with other Governmental Entities under Competition Laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. " _Competition Laws_ " mean the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal
or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,

monopolization or restraint of trade. Each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for
additional information made by the United States Department of Justice, the
Federal Trade Commission or any other Governmental Entities, and act in good
faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any
investigation of any Governmental Entity. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any filing,
form, declaration, notification, registration and notice. Each party shall
give the other party reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and
any proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Entity
regarding any filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or
notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
communication, understanding or agreement with any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement. None of the
parties shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings or inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting
and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. The parties will

 



57

    

 consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any information or
proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Competition Law. For the avoidance of doubt, neither party shall have any
obligation to expend funds, other than in immaterial amounts, contest or
resist any action or proceeding under or relating to any Competition Law,
including any administrative or judicial action.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_, each of the parties to this Agreement
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties related to or required in connection with the Merger that
are necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement, (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and (v) the
providing of all such information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries,
its Affiliates and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates officers, directors,
employees and partners as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
of the matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_ or this _Section_ __ _
5.5(b)_. Each of Menlo and Foamix agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time each of the consents that are
listed in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_ of the Foamix Disclosure Letter.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
neither Menlo nor Foamix shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of its businesses,
product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any other action or agree
to any limitation or restriction, that is reasonably likely to result in a
Menlo Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of this clause, after
giving effect to the Merger) or a Foamix Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation by Foamix; Foamix Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) Foamix shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit the Foamix Subsidiary
or its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action designed to, or
which is reasonably expected to, facilitate, any Foamix Takeover Proposal,
(ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Foamix Takeover
Proposal, (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish to any Person any
non-public information with respect to, or knowingly cooperate with, any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Foamix
Takeover Proposal, or (iv) waive or release any Person from, forebear in the
enforcement of, or amend any confidentiality, standstill or similar Contract
or any confidentiality or standstill provisions of any other Contract, unless
the Foamix Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such
counterparty is capable of making a Foamix Takeover Proposal that is
reasonably expected to lead to a Foamix Superior Proposal and the failure to
take action would be inconsistent with the Foamix Boards fiduciary duties
under Israeli Law ( _provided, however,_ that in order to determine the
appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary duties, Foamix Board
may also consider and act on the basis of the fiduciary duties owed by a board
of directors to the shareholders of a company under Delaware Law) in which
event Foamix may take the preceding actions solely to the extent necessary to
permit a Person to make, on a confidential basis, to the Foamix Board, a
Foamix Takeover Proposal conditioned upon such Person agreeing that (A)
Foamix shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Menlo
(including regarding such Foamix Takeover Proposal); and (B) such Person
entering into a customary confidentiality agreement which need not include a
customary "standstill" or similar covenant not less restrictive of such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and providing for the right for
Foamix to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _
5.6(b)_. Foamix shall, and shall cause the Foamix Subsidiary and its

 



58

    

 Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead
to, any Foamix Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Foamix Shareholder Approval, in
response to a bona fide written Foamix Takeover Proposal that the Foamix Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, a Foamix Superior Proposal, and which Foamix
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof in breach (other
than an immaterial breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, was made after the
date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach (other than an
immaterial breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_, Foamix may, if the Foamix
Board determines (after receiving the advice of outside counsel) that the
failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Israeli Law ( _provided, however,_ that in order to determine the
appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary duties, Foamix Board
may also consider and act on the basis of the fiduciary duties owed by a
board of directors to the shareholders of a company under Delaware Law), and
subject to compliance (in all but immaterial respects) with this _Section_ __
_ 5.6(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_ and after giving Menlo written notice
of such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to Foamix and the
Foamix Subsidiary to the Person making such Foamix Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
(provided that such agreement need not contain a customary "standstill") not
less restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that (1) all such information has previously been provided to Menlo or is
provided to Menlo prior to the time it is provided to such Person and (2) such
customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for Foamix to
comply with the terms of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_,
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Foamix Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Foamix
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation (other than an immaterial violation) of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ by any Representative or Affiliate of Foamix
or the Foamix Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.6(a)_ by Foamix.

The term " _Foamix Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
consolidated net revenues, net income, or assets (based on the fair market
value thereof) of Foamix and the Foamix Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of
Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary, or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving Foamix or the
Foamix Subsidiary pursuant to which any Person or the stockholders of any
Person would own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of Foamix or
the Foamix Subsidiary or of any resulting parent company of Foamix, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

The term " _Foamix Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Foamix Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition references to
15% in the definition of "Foamix Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to 50%) which the Foamix Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Foamix
from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Menlo in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable
of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

(b) Neither the Foamix Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i) (A) withdraw
(or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Menlo or Menlo Merger Sub), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Menlo or Menlo Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Foamix Board or any such committee thereof
of this Agreement, the Merger or

 



59

    

 the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend,
adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt,
approve or declare advisable, any Foamix Takeover Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Foamix Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
allow Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Foamix Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section_ __ _
5.6(a)_ pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth therein).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Foamix
Shareholder Approval, the Foamix Board may make a Foamix
Adverse Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a Foamix Takeover
Proposal after execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach
(other than an immaterial breach) of _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ and that the
Foamix Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) solely in response to any material
event, development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or
facts (including any material change in probability or magnitude of
circumstances), not related to a Foamix Takeover Proposal, and that first
occurred following the execution of this Agreement other than the results of
any pre-clinical or clinical testing conducted by Foamix or Menlo with respect
to any product or product candidate of Foamix or Menlo, as applicable (a "
_Foamix Intervening Event_ "); in each case referred to in the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B), only if the Foamix Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Israeli Law ( _provided, however,_ that in order to
determine the appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary duties,
Foamix Board may also consider and act on the basis of the fiduciary duties
owed by a board of directors to the shareholders of a company under Delaware
Law); _provided_ , however, that Foamix shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to make a Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fourth
(4th) Business Day following Menlo receipt of written notice (a " _Foamix
Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from Foamix advising Menlo that the Foamix
Board intends to make a Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying
the reasons therefor, including in the case of a Foamix Superior Proposal the
terms and conditions of any Foamix Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Foamix Board (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Foamix Superior Proposal shall require
a new Foamix Notice of Recommendation Change and a new three (3) business day
period ). In determining whether to make a Foamix Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Foamix Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Menlo in response to a Foamix Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise, and if requested by Menlo, Foamix shall
engage in good faith negotiations with Menlo regarding any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Menlo.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Foamix set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.6(a)_ and _5.6(b)_ , (i) Foamix shall promptly advise Menlo orally and in
writing (and in any case within 48 hours) of the receipt of any Foamix
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry that is reasonably expected to lead to any
Foamix Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Foamix
Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the Person making any such Foamix Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii)
Foamix shall (A) keep Menlo fully and promptly informed of the status and
material details (including any change to any material term thereof) of any
such Foamix Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Menlo promptly
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of any written proposal and
draft documentation sent or provided to Foamix or the Foamix Subsidiary from
any Person that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any
Foamix Takeover Proposal or inquiry.

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall prohibit Foamix from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14(e)-2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to Foamixs stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Foamix Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Israeli Law (
_provided, however,_ that in order to determine the appropriate standards
that would apply to such

 



60

    

 fiduciary duties, Foamix Board may also consider and act on the basis of the
fiduciary duties owed by a board of directors to the shareholders of a company
under Delaware Law); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if any such disclosure
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(d)_ has the substantive effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying the Foamix Boards recommendation to vote
for a Merger, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Foamix Adverse
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _No Solicitation by Menlo; Menlo Board Recommendation_.

(a) Menlo shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit its Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take
any other action designed to, or which is reasonably expected to, facilitate,
any Menlo Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Menlo Takeover Proposal, (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or knowingly furnish to any
Person any non-public information with respect to, or knowingly
cooperate with, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, any Menlo Takeover Proposal or (iv) waive or release any Person from,
forebear in the enforcement of, or amend any confidentiality, standstill or
similar Contract or any confidentiality or standstill provisions of any other
Contract, unless, the Menlo Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that such counterparty is capable of making a Menlo Takeover
Proposal that is reasonably expected to lead to a Menlo Superior Proposal, and
the failure to take action would be inconsistent with the Menlo Boards
fiduciary duties in which event Menlo may take the preceding actions solely
to the extent necessary to permit a Person to make, on a confidential basis,
to the Menlo Board, a Menlo Takeover Proposal conditioned upon such Person
agreeing that (A) Menlo shall not be prohibited from providing any
information to Foamix (including regarding such Menlo Takeover Proposal); and
(B) such Person entering into a customary confidentiality agreement which need
not include a customary "standstill" or similar covenant not less restrictive
of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and providing for the right
for Menlo to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _
5.7(b)_. Menlo shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with
any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes,
or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Menlo Takeover Proposal and request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Menlo
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Menlo Takeover
Proposal that the Menlo Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, a
Menlo Superior Proposal, and which Menlo Takeover Proposal was not solicited
after the date hereof in breach (other than an immaterial breach) of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_, was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise
result from a breach (other than an immaterial breach) of this _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_, Menlo may, if the Menlo Board determines (after receiving the advice
of outside counsel) that the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and subject to
compliance (in all but immaterial respects) with this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_
and _Section_ __ _ 5.7(c)_ and after giving Foamix written notice of
such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to Menlo to the
Person making such Menlo Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person
than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (1) all such information
has previously been provided to Menlo or is provided to Menlo prior to the
time it is provided to such Person and (2) such customary confidentiality
agreement expressly provides the right for Menlo to comply with the terms of
this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_, and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Menlo Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Menlo Takeover Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation (other than an
immaterial violation) of the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_ by any Representative or Affiliate of Menlo shall be deemed to be a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ by Menlo.

(b) The term " _Menlo Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any Person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to,
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series
of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
net revenues, net income, or assets (based on the fair market value thereof)
of Menlo, or 15% or more of any class of equity

 



61

    

 securities of Menlo, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Menlo, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving Menlo pursuant to
which any Person or the stockholders of any Person would own 15% or more of
any class of equity securities of Menlo or of any resulting parent company of
Menlo, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) The term " _Menlo Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Menlo Takeover
Proposal ( _provided_ , that for purposes of this definition references to
15% in the definition of "Menlo Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to 50%) which the Menlo Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of Menlo
from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all
relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Menlo in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable
of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

(d) Neither Menlo the Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i) (A) withdraw
(or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Menlo or Menlo Merger Sub), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Menlo or Menlo Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Menlo Board or any such committee thereof
of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any
Menlo Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Menlo Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow Menlo to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to,
or that is intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Menlo
Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations
set forth therein). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining Menlo Stockholder Approval, the Menlo Board may make a Menlo Adverse
Recommendation Change (A) following receipt of a Menlo Takeover Proposal
after execution of this Agreement that did not result from a breach (other
than an immaterial breach) of _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ and that the Menlo Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a Menlo
Superior Proposal or (B) solely in response to any material event,
development, circumstance, occurrence or change in circumstances or facts
(including any material change in probability or magnitude of circumstances),
not related to a Menlo Takeover Proposal, and that first occurred following
the execution of this Agreement other than the results of any pre-clinical or
clinical testing conducted by Foamix or Menlo with respect to any product or
product candidate of Foamix or Menlo, as applicable (a " _Menlo Intervening
Event_ "); in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),
only if the Menlo Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that Menlo shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a Menlo Adverse Recommendation Change until after
the fourth (4th) Business Day following Foamixs receipt of written notice (a
" _Menlo Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from Menlo advising Foamix that
the Menlo Board intends to make a Menlo Adverse Recommendation Change and
specifying the reasons therefor, including in the case of a Menlo Superior
Proposal the terms and conditions of any Menlo Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action by the Menlo Board (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Menlo Superior Proposal
shall require a new Menlo Notice of Recommendation Change and a new three (3)
business day period ). In determining whether to make a Menlo
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Menlo Board shall take into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Foamix in response to a
Menlo Notice of Recommendation Change or otherwise, and if requested by
Foamix, Menlo shall engage in good faith negotiations with Foamix regarding
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Foamix.

such Menlo Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Foamix
promptly after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of any written
proposal and draft documentation sent or provided to Menlo from any Person
that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any Menlo Takeover
Proposal or inquiry.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall prohibit Menlo from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14(e)-2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to Menlo stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Menlo Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such disclosure pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(d)_ has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying the Menlo Boards recommendation to vote for a Merger, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Menlo Adverse Recommendation Change
for purposes of this Agreement

Section 5.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. Foamix shall give Menlo the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation against Foamix
or its directors relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without the prior written consent of Menlo, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Menlo shall give Foamix the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any litigation
against Menlo or its directors relating to the Merger and the

in any way the parties obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, each of
Foamix and Menlo shall cooperate, and Foamix shall cause the Foamix Subsidiary

(a) For not less than seven years from and after the Effective Time, Menlo
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify and hold harmless
all past and present directors, officers and employees of Foamix to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Foamix
pursuant to Foamix Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements,
if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors,
officers or employees of Foamix for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time and to indemnify and hold harmless such Persons to the
fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Menlo shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, for
an aggregate period of not less than seven years from the Effective Time,
Foamixs past and present directors and officers with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than
Foamixs existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Menlo
agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in effect, for the
benefit of all past and present directors, officers and employees of Menlo to
the same extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement
by Menlo pursuant to Menlo Organizational Documents and

Agreement with any directors, officers or employees of Menlo for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and to indemnify and
hold harmless such Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts or

year "tail" prepaid directors and officers insurance policy, provided that it
may not pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the
annual amount paid by Menlo for coverage during its current coverage period.
In the event that Menlo purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time, Menlo shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect in
lieu of its obligations under the second sentence of this _Section_ __ _
5.9(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release shall be a
joint press release and thereafter Foamix and Menlo each shall obtain the
prior consent of the other prior to issuing any press releases or making other
public statements and communications with respect to the Merger, the other

Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of
Nasdaq in which case, each party shall provide drafts in advance of and as
soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, Foamix and Menlo shall develop a
joint communications strategy and each party shall ensure that all press
releases and other public statements and communications (including any
communications that would require a filing under the Rule 425, Rule 165 and
Rule 166 of the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 of the Exchange Act), with
analysts, members of the financial community or otherwise, with respect to the
Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Foamix

Section 5.11 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Menlo Stockholders_ __ _Meeting;
Foamix Shareholders_ __ _Meeting_ _; Menlo Merger Sub Meeting_ __.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Menlo and
Foamix shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement relating
to Foamix Shareholder Approval and Menlo Stockholder Approval (such joint
proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint
Proxy Statement_ "), and Menlo shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 together with all amendments thereto, (the
" _Registration Statement_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of Menlo and Foamix shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Menlo will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed
to Menlos stockholders, and Foamix will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to Foamixs shareholders, in each
case as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Menlo or Foamix without the other partys prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and without providing the other party the
opportunity to review and comment thereon (which comments will be considered
in good faith). Menlo will advise Foamix, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or
the suspension of the qualification of the Menlo Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger and the Share Issuance for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and each party will advise the other promptly of any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information (including any Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change or Menlo
Adverse Recommendation Change) relating to Menlo or Foamix, or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become Known to
Menlo or Foamix which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an

 



64

    

 appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of Menlo and the shareholders of Foamix.

(b) Each of Foamix and Menlo shall supply such information specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
necessary so that, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement necessary so that, at the
date it is first mailed to Foamixs shareholders or Menlos stockholders or at
the time of Foamix Shareholders Meeting (as defined in _Section_ __ _
5.11(c)_ below) or the Menlo Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section_
__ _ 5.11(c)_ below), the Joint Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of the
parties hereto shall use their best efforts so that the Joint Proxy Statement
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) Each of Foamix and Menlo shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, and in
accordance with applicable Law and Foamix Organizational Documents, in the
case of Foamix, and the Menlo Organizational Documents, in the case of Menlo,
establish a record date for, give, publish the notice of, convene, hold and
schedule a meeting of its shareholders or stockholders (as related to Foamix,
the " _Notice Date_ "), respectively, as promptly as practicable to consider,
in the case of Menlo, the Share Issuance (the " _Menlo Stockholders 
Meeting_") and, in the case of Foamix, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement, and the Merger (" _Foamix
Shareholders  Meeting_"). Unless there has been a Foamix Adverse
Recommendation Change (in the case of Foamix) or a Menlo Adverse
Recommendation Change (in the case of Menlo), as the case may be, each of
Foamix and Menlo will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
shareholders or stockholders, as applicable, proxies in favor of, in the case
of Menlo, the Share Issuance, and, in the case of Foamix, the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and will take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of Nasdaq or applicable Law to obtain such approvals.
Foamix shall comply with the notice requirements applicable to Foamix in
respect of Foamix Shareholders Meeting pursuant to the Companies Law and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the Articles of Association. Foamix
shall consult with Menlo regarding the date of the Foamix Shareholders
Meeting, which, subject to the terms of the next sentence relating to
postponement and adjournment thereof, shall be held as soon as reasonably
practicable (taking into account necessary solicitation of stockholders)
following the Notice Date. Each of Foamix and Menlo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Foamix
Shareholders Meeting and the Menlo Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on
the same day and at the same time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Foamix or Menlo may adjourn or postpone Foamix
Shareholders Meeting or Menlo Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable, in advance of a vote on, in the case of Menlo, the Share Issuance,
and, in the case of Foamix, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
the Merger, or, if, as of the time for which Foamix Shareholders Meeting or
Menlo Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient Foamix Shares or shares of Menlo Common Stock, as the
case may be, represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Unless there has been a
Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of Foamix) or a Menlo
Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of Menlo), each of Foamix and
Menlo shall ensure that Foamix Shareholders Meeting and the Menlo
Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with Foamix
Shareholders Meeting or Menlo Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, are
solicited in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of Nasdaq and, in the
case of Foamix, Foamix Organizational Documents, and, in the case of Menlo,
the Menlo Organizational Documents. Without the prior written consent of
Menlo, approval and adoption of this Agreement

 



65

    

 and the Contingent Stock Rights Agreement, approval of the Merger and
approval of a proposal to the Foamix shareholders for a non-binding, advisory
vote to approve certain compensation that may become payable to Menlo and
Foamix named executive officers in connection with the completion of the
Merger are the only matters which Foamix shall propose to be acted on by
Foamixs shareholders at Foamix Shareholders Meeting. Without the prior
written consent of Foamix (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
approval of the Share Issuance is the only matter which Menlo shall propose to
be acted on by Menlos stockholders at the Menlo Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Unless there has been a Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case
of Foamix) or a Menlo Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of Menlo),
each of Foamix and Menlo will use its reasonable best efforts to hold Foamix
Shareholders Meeting and Menlo Stockholders Meeting, respectively, on the
same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement.

(e) Unless there has been a Foamix Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case
of Foamix) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ or a Menlo Adverse
Recommendation Change (in the case of Menlo) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.7(b)_: (i) the Foamix Board and the Menlo Board shall recommend that its
stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of Foamix, the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at Foamix Shareholders Meeting,
and, in the case of Menlo, the Share Issuance at the Menlo Stockholders
Meeting, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that (A) the Menlo Board has recommended that Menlos stockholders vote
in favor of the Share Issuance at the Menlos Stockholder Meeting and (B)
the Foamix Board has recommended that Foamixs shareholders vote in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at Foamix Shareholders
Meeting and (iii) neither the Foamix Board or any committee thereof, nor the
Menlo Board or any committee thereof, shall withdraw, amend or modify, or
propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the
other party, the recommendation of the Foamix Board or the Menlo Board,
respectively, that the shareholders of Foamix or stockholders of Menlo,

(a) Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by applicable local
Law, from and after the Closing, Menlo shall, or shall cause its applicable
Affiliate (including the Surviving Company following the Closing) to honor all

upon a similar termination of employment immediately prior to the Closing and
(iii) defined contribution retirement and health and welfare benefits that

Menlo to, take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to

Foamix). Menlo also shall take, prior to the Effective Time, such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any Menlo 401(k) Plan as Foamix may
reasonably request in writing.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall confer upon
any employee of Menlo or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Company following the Closing) or legal representative or beneficiary thereof,
or any other Person, any rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period,

 



68

    

 or level of compensation or benefits. Nothing contained in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall constitute an amendment, modification or adoption of
any Menlo Benefit Plan or Foamix Benefit Plan or interfere with the right of
Menlo, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any Menlo Benefit Plan or Foamix Benefit Plan or to

Trials and QST Consultations, LTD to deliver the Efficacy Determination,

not demonstrate Serlopitant Significance, then until the earlier of the

with respect to Serlopitant in the United States or Europe, as applicable.

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the Company, Giants Merger Subsidiary Ltd., a company incorporated
under the laws of the State of Israel and registered under No. 516103165 with
the Israeli Registrar of Companies, and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (" _Menlo Merger Sub_ "), and Foamix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a
company incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel and registered
under No. 51-336881-1 with the Israeli Registrar of Companies (" _Foamix_ "),
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 10,
2019 (as may be amended and restated from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, at the Effective Time (as defined in the
Merger Agreement, the " _Effective Time_ "), Menlo Merger Sub will be merged
(the " _Merger_ ") with and into Foamix, with Foamix continuing as the
surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;

 

WHEREAS, the consideration to be paid by the Company pursuant to the Merger
Agreement includes one contingent stock right as hereinafter described (a "

NIS 0.16 per share, of Foamix (each, a " _Foamix Share_ ") issued and

WHEREAS, each person who from time to time holds one or more CSRs shall be
entitled to the conversion of such CSRs for such number of shares of Common
Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the " _Menlo Common Stock_

WHEREAS, a registration statement on Form S-4 (No. [●]) (the "
_Registration Statement_ ") with respect to, among other securities, the
shares of Menlo Common Stock issuable pursuant to the CSRs, has been prepared
and filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_Commission_ ") and has become effective in accordance with the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ");

WHEREAS, the parties have done all things necessary to make the CSRs, when
issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement and hereunder, the valid obligations
of the Company, and to make this Agreement a valid agreement of the Company,
in accordance with its terms; 

WHEREAS, the Company desires the Rights Agent to act on behalf of the Company,
and the Rights Agent is willing to act in connection with the issuance,
transfer, exchange and conversion of CSRs as provided herein; and

WHEREAS, terms used herein but not defined herein, shall have the meanings
set forth in the Merger Agreement.

   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements herein,
the Company and the Rights Agent hereby agree as follows:

Section 1\. _Holders of CSRs; Appointment of Rights Agent_.

 

(a) As provided in the Merger Agreement, effective as of the Closing, (i) each
Holder will be entitled to one CSR for each Foamix Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is validly accepted
for payment, and paid for, pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii) of the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) each Foamix Warrant that is assumed by the Company
pursuant to Section 5.20 of the Merger Agreement will become exercisable for
one CSR for each Foamix Share that the holder of such Foamix Warrant would
have been entitled to receive had such Foamix Warrant been exercised prior to
the Effective Time. 

(b) The Company hereby appoints [●] as the Rights Agent to act as agent for
the Company in accordance with the instructions hereinafter set forth in this
Agreement, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company
may from time to time appoint such co-rights agents as it may deem necessary
or desirable. The Rights Agent shall have no duty to supervise, and shall in
no event be liable for, the acts or omissions of any such co-rights agents. In
the event of the appointment of a co-rights agent pursuant to this Section 1,
the Company shall cause such co-rights agent to become vested with the same
powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had originally been
named as Rights Agent.

Section 2\. _No Certificates_. The CSRs shall not be evidenced by
a certificate or other instrument.

Section 3\. _Registration by the Rights Agent_.

 

(a) The Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the registered holder
(the " _Holder_ ") of a CSR as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes,
and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary.

(b) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Rights Agents principal office
a register (the " _CSR Register_ ") in which the Rights Agent shall provide
for the up-to-date registration of CSRs. CSRs shall be registered in the
names and addresses of, and in the denomination as set forth in, the
applicable letter of transmittal accompanying the Foamix Shares surrendered
by the holder thereof in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Merger
Agreement. The CSRs issued in consideration for 102 Common Stock shall be
registered in the name of the 102 Trustee (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) in the CSR Register for the benefit of the applicable beneficial
holder. A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent or the Company
to change such Holders address of record in the CSR Register. The
written request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such
written request by the Rights Agent or the Company, the Rights Agent shall
promptly record the change of address in the CSR Register. The Rights Agent
shall provide a copy of the CSR Register to the Company upon request.

Section 4\. _Rights of CSR Holder_.

 

(a) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring upon
any Holder, by virtue of being a Holder of a CSR, the right to receive
dividends, or the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as
stockholders in respect of the meetings of stockholders or the election of
directors of the Company or any other matter, or any rights of any kind or
nature whatsoever as a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in
equity.

 



2

    

(b) The CSRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in the
Company, any constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective
affiliates. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that a CSR shall not
constitute a security of the Company or of the Surviving Corporation. The
rights of a Holder in respect of the CSRs are limited to those expressed in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Merger Agreement to
the contrary, none of the Company, Menlo Merger Sub, or any of their
representatives shall have any liability, responsibility or obligation of any
kind to any Holder in their capacity as such on any basis (including in
contract, tort, under federal or state securities law or otherwise) with
respect to, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, the CSRs or the
Merger, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

(c) A Holder may at any time, at such Holders option, abandon all of such
Holders remaining rights represented by CSRs by transferring such CSR to the
Company or a person nominated in writing by the Company without consideration
in compensation therefor, and such rights will be cancelled. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to prohibit the Company or its affiliates from offering
to acquire or acquiring the CSRs, in private transactions or otherwise, for
consideration in its sole discretion.

 

Section 5\. _Non-transferability_. The CSRs and any interest therein shall not
be sold, assigned, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, other than through a
Permitted Transfer (as defined herein) and, in the case of a Permitted
Transfer, only in accordance with Section 6 hereof and in compliance with
applicable United States federal and state securities laws and the terms and
conditions hereof. Any attempted sale, assignment, transfer, pledge,
encumbrance or disposition of CSRs, in whole or in part, in violation of this
Section 5 shall be _void ab initio_ and of no effect. In addition, each
Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a CSR, shall be deemed to have agreed
to not facilitate or recognize any attempt by any beneficial owner of such
CSR, including any former street holder of Foamix Shares or any broker,
dealer, custodian bank or other nominee of a former street holder of Foamix
Shares to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or in any other manner
transfer or dispose of, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, an
interest in such CSR other than through a Permitted Transfer. A " _Permitted
Transfer_ " shall mean (a) respect to all CSRs, the transfer of any or all of
the CSRs on death by will or intestacy; (b) with respect to all CSRs other
than CSRs issued in consideration for 102 Common Stock (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), a transfer of CSRs (i) by instrument to an inter vivos or
testamentary trust in which the CSRs are to be passed to beneficiaries upon
the death of the trustee; (ii) pursuant to a court order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (such as in connection with divorce, bankruptcy or
liquidation); or (iii) a transfer made by operation of law (such as a
merger); _provided_ that any such transferred CSR shall remain subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



3

    

Section 6\. _Transfer of CSRs_.

 

(a) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in Section 5
hereof, the Rights Agent shall, from time to time, register the transfer of
any outstanding CSRs pursuant to a Permitted Transfer upon the CSR Register,
upon delivery to the Rights Agent of a written instrument or instruments of
transfer and other requested documentation in form satisfactory to the Company
and the Rights Agent, duly executed by the registered Holder or Holders
thereof or by the duly appointed legal representative thereof or by a duly
authorized attorney, such signature to be guaranteed by a participant in a
recognized Signature Guarantee Medallion Program. A request for a transfer of
a CSR shall be accompanied by such documentation establishing satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 5 hereof, as applicable, as may be
reasonably requested by the Company (including opinions of counsel, if
appropriate). Upon receipt of documentation reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, the Company shall authorize the Rights Agent to permit the transfer
of a CSR. The Rights Agent shall not permit the transfer of a CSR until it is
so authorized by the Company. No transfer of a CSR shall be valid until
registered in the CSR Register and any transfer not duly registered in the CSR
Register will be _void ab initio_. All transfers of CSRs registered in the CSR
Register shall be the valid obligations of the Company, representing the same
rights to receive shares of Menlo Common Stock as the CSRs transferred then
entitled such transferee to receive, and shall entitle the transferee to the
same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held by the
transferor. No fractional CSRs will be registered. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, and subject to any other provision in the Withholding
Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim Ruling, and the 104H Tax Ruling (as such terms
are defined in the Merger Agreement) or any other written instructions
provided by the Israel Tax Authority, it is hereby clarified that no transfer
of a CSR under this Agreement shall be permitted and/or effected, unless
Menlo and the Rights Agent are fully satisfied that any and all withholding
obligations with respect to Israeli taxes have been met. For this purpose, the
provisions of Section 9 below shall be applicable to any transfers hereto.

 

(b) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of CSRs,
but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp or
other tax or other governmental charge that is imposed in connection with any
such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or
obligation to take any action under any Section of this Agreement which
requires the payment by a Holder of a CSR of applicable taxes and charges
unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such taxes and/or
charges have been paid.

 

Section 7\. _Exercisability of CSRs_.

 

(a) As used herein, " _Milestone Date_ " shall mean the date on which the
Efficacy Determination is delivered to Menlo. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Efficacy Determination" means (i) the top-line primary endpoint results of
both Phase III PN Trials as delivered in the form set forth (and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth) in Exhibit 2.4(g)(ii) hereto by QST
Consultations, LTD to Menlo; or (ii) if the top-line primary endpoint results
of only one Phase III PN Trials is delivered in the form set forth (and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth) in Exhibit 2.4(g)(ii) hereto by
QST Consultations, LTD to Menlo on or before May 31, 2020, such results as
delivered in such form.

 

(b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each CSR shall become convertible
and shall entitle the Holder thereof to receive from the Company the number
of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Menlo Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (as defined below) together, if applicable, with cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 13 hereof and any
dividends or distributions payable as provided in Section 14 hereof, in each
case subject to any applicable withholding tax.

(i) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean:

 

(1) (A) if the Efficacy Determination reports that Serlopitant Significance
was not achieved in both Phase III PN Trials or (B) the Milestone Date does
not occur on or before May 31, 2020 (the " _Outside Expiration Date_ "), then
each CSR will be converted into 1.2082 shares of Menlo Common Stock pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

(2) if the Efficacy Determination reports that (A) Serlopitant Significance
was achieved in only one Phase III PN Trial on or before the Outside
Expiration Date, and (B) Serlopitant Significance was not achieved or has not

(3) if the Efficacy Determination reports that Serlopitant Significance was
achieved in both Phase III PN Trials on or before the Outside Expiration Date,
then the CSR will automatically be terminated, and the Holder thereof shall
not be entitled to any shares of Menlo Common Stock relating to the CSR or
any other rights under this Agreement (the date on which the CSR will be
automatically terminated, the " _Serlopitant Efficacy Expiration Date_ ").

 

(4) " _Serlopitant Significance_ " shall mean (as set forth in and in
accordance with the Efficacy Determination) achievement of proof of
statistically significant superiority of serlopitant treatment over placebo
treatment on the primary endpoint (meaning that (A) the Serlopitant 5 mg
percent success rate is numerically greater than the placebo percent success
rate and (B) the P-value is less than 0.05) determined when comparing Worst
Itch-Numerical Rating Scale (WI-NRS) 4-point responder rates between
treatments at Week 10, which analysis shall be based upon the "Intent-to-
Treat" population where missing data is imputed using a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation method and where the primary analytical
method is a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause Synteract, Inc. and TFS International AB to complete
the Phase III PN Trials and QST Consultations, LTD to deliver the Efficacy
Determination, concurrently for both Phase III PN Trials, to the Company, on
or before the Outside Expiration Date; and (ii) the Company shall
publicly disclose a summary of the results reported in any Efficacy
Determination within three (3) Business Days of the Milestone Date. In the
event that either Phase III PN Trial does not demonstrate Serlopitant
Significance, then the Company shall have no further obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 7(c)_ or otherwise to conduct any further clinical trials with
respect to Serlopitant in the United States, or Europe, as applicable.

Section 8\. _Conversion Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 7 hereof, if Serlopitant Significance
was not achieved in either Phase III PN Trial on or before the Outside
Expiration Date, then within ten (10) Business Days of the occurrence of the
earlier of the Milestone Date or the Outside Expiration Date and, subject to
the tax withholding procedure described in Sections 8(e) and 9(b) below,
the Company shall credit (or shall cause its Transfer Agent to credit) the
appropriate number of book-entry shares of Menlo Common Stock (as determined
in accordance with Section 7(b)) to each Holder in the name of such Holder as
recorded in the CSR Register. Such book-entry shares of Menlo Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued and any person so named therein shall be
deemed to have become a holder of record of such shares of Menlo Common Stock
as of the Milestone Date or Outside Expiration Date, as applicable.

(b) If Serlopitant Significance was not achieved in either Phase III PN Trial
on or before the Outside Expiration Date, then within ten (10) Business Days
of the Company informing the Rights Agent of the occurrence of the Milestone
Date or the Outside Expiration Date (as applicable) and the consideration to
be paid to each Holder pursuant to Section 7(b), and subject to the tax
withholding procedure described in Sections 8(e) and 9(b) below, the Company
shall deliver to the Rights Agent any cash necessary to be paid to Holders in
lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 13 hereof, and the Rights
Agent shall deliver to each Holder at his, her or its address appearing on the
CSR Register, (i) a written notice specifying the number of shares of Menlo
Common Stock (if any) that each CSR was converted into and to whom the shares
of Menlo Common Stock were issued and the Rights Agent shall promptly record
such issuance in the CSR Register and (ii) a check reflecting the amount of
any cash in lieu of fractional shares to be provided to such Holder as
provided in Section 13 hereof and, if applicable, amounts payable pursuant to
Section 14\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any cash necessary to be paid to
holders who received the CSRs in consideration for 102 Common Stock, shall be
payable by a wire transfer to the 102 Trustee.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any portion of the
cash provided by the Company to the Rights Agent as a reserve for purposes of
payments to Holders of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
13 hereof and, if applicable, amounts payable pursuant to Section 14 that
remains unclaimed after the first anniversary of the Milestone Date
(including by means of uncashed checks or invalid addresses on the CSR
Register) (the " _Termination Date_ ") (or such earlier date immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the
property of the Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto, and no consideration or compensation shall be
payable therefor.

(d) The Rights Agent shall keep copies of this Agreement available for
inspection by the Holders during normal business hours at its office. The
Company shall supply the Rights Agent from time to time with such numbers of
copies of this Agreement as the Rights Agent may request.

to the Rights Agent for payment to the Holders in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 13 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the 

 



6

    

 Withholding Agent (as defined in Section 9(b)) a list of all Holders and the
number of shares to be credited thereto and/or cash to be paid thereto, and
the Withholding Agent shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from such
shares and/or cash (if required, in accordance with Section 9(b) below). Upon
completion of any required withholding the Company shall credit (or cause its
Transfer Agent to credit) the appropriate number of shares of Menlo Common
Stock to the Holders pursuant to Section 8(a) and deliver to the Rights Agent
the appropriate amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid to the
Holders pursuant to Section 8(b).

 

Section 9\. _Payment of Taxes_ _; Tax Reporting_.

 

(a) The Company will pay all stamp, transfer or other taxes or governmental
charges, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of shares of Menlo
Common Stock upon the conversion of any CSR; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be required to pay any tax or
taxes which may be payable in respect of any transfer of a CSR or, upon
conversion of a CSR, issuance of any shares of Menlo Common Stock in a name
other than that of the Holder of a CSR as recorded in the CSR Register, and
the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such CSR unless or until
the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the
Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Company that such tax has been paid.

 

(b) Foamix, the Company, Exchange Agent (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
the 102 Trustee, Menlo, the Surviving Company, and any other Person who has
any obligation to deduct or withhold from any consideration payable pursuant
to this Agreement (each such Person, a " _Withholding Agent_ ") shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom, all in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 2.2(h) through 2.2(k) of the Merger Agreement, which shall apply to
the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, mutatis mutandis,
including the issuance or transfer of any CSR, the conversion thereof, the
issuance of shares or the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

 

(c) The Rights Agent shall comply with all applicable laws and shall adhere to
the provisions set forth in the Withholding Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim
Ruling, and the 104H Tax Ruling (as such terms are defined in the Merger
Agreement), and any other written instructions provided by the Israel Tax
Authority, including, for the avoidance of doubt, regarding Tax reporting and
withholding (including under the tax laws the State of Israel) with respect
to any consideration payable or deliverable to any Holder of CSRs pursuant to
this Agreement.

 

Section 10\. _Reservation of Menlo Common Stock_.

 

(a) The Company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from
preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Menlo
Common Stock or the authorized and issued Menlo Common Stock held in its
treasury, for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue
shares of Menlo Common Stock upon conversion of CSRs, the maximum number of
shares of Menlo Common Stock which may then be deliverable upon conversion of
all outstanding CSRs.

 



7

    

(b) The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the transfer
agent for Menlo Common Stock (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") and with every
subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the Companys capital stock
issuable upon conversion of the CSRs. The Company will provide or otherwise
make available any cash which may be payable as provided in Section 13 and
Section 14 hereof. The Company will furnish such Transfer Agent a copy of all
notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto transmitted to each
Holder pursuant to Section 15 hereof.

(c) The Company covenants that all shares of Menlo Common Stock which may be
issued upon conversion of CSRs will, upon issue, be validly authorized and
issued, fully paid, nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all
taxes, liens, charges and security interests with respect to the issuance
thereof. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all such
authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having
jurisdiction thereof as may be necessary to enable the Company to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 11\. _Listing of Common Stock_. The Company shall from time to time
use its reasonable best efforts so that immediately upon their issuance upon
the conversion of any CSR the shares of Menlo Common Stock will be listed on
the principal national securities exchange in the United States of America, if
any, on which the Companys other shares of Menlo Common Stock is then
listed.

Section 12\. _Adjustment of CSRs_.

 

(a) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Menlo Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Menlo Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Milestone Date.

(b) In case of (i) any capital reorganization, other than in the cases
referred to in Section 13(a) hereof and other than any capital reorganization
that does not result in any reclassification of the outstanding shares of
Menlo Common Stock into shares of other stock or other securities or property,
or (ii) the consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another
corporation (other than a merger or consolidation in which the Company is the
continuing corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of
the outstanding shares of Menlo Common Stock into shares of other stock or
other securities or property), or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Company, in each case on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Milestone Date (collectively such actions being hereinafter
referred to as " _Reorganizations_ "), there shall thereafter be deliverable
upon conversion of any CSR in accordance with the terms hereof (in lieu of the
number of shares of Menlo Common Stock theretofore deliverable) the number of
shares of stock or other securities, property or cash to which a holder of the
number of shares of Menlo Common Stock that would otherwise have been
deliverable upon the conversion of such CSR would have been entitled
upon such Reorganization if the Milestone Date had occurred and such CSR had
been converted in full immediately prior to such Reorganization. In case of
any Reorganization, appropriate adjustment, as determined in good faith by the
board of directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in
a duly adopted resolution

 



8

    

 certified by the Companys Secretary or Assistant Secretary, shall be made
in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the
rights and interests of Holders so that the provisions set forth herein shall
thereafter be applicable, as nearly as possible, in relation to any such
shares or other securities, property or cash thereafter deliverable upon
conversion of CSRs.

 

(c) The Company shall not effect any such Reorganization unless prior to or
simultaneously with the consummation thereof the successor corporation (if
other than the Company) resulting from such Reorganization or the corporation
or other entity purchasing such assets shall expressly assume, by a
supplemental contingent stock rights agreement or other acknowledgment
executed and delivered to the Rights Agent, the obligation to deliver to the
Rights Agent and to cause the Rights Agent to deliver to each such Holder such
shares of stock, securities or assets as, in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, such Holder may be entitled to in accordance with the terms
hereof upon the occurrence of the Milestone Date, and the due and punctual
performance and observance of each and every covenant, condition, obligation
and liability under this Agreement to be performed and observed by the
Company in the manner prescribed herein. The provisions of Section 13(b) and
Section 13(c) shall apply to successive Reorganization transactions.

 

(d) Irrespective of any adjustments in the number or kind of shares issuable
upon the conversion of the CSRs, CSRs theretofore or thereafter issued may
continue to express the same dollar value and number and kind of shares as are
stated in the CSRs initially issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(e) Whenever an adjustment is made to the terms of the CSRs pursuant to this
Section 13, the Company shall provide the notices required by Section 16
hereof.

(f) The Rights Agent has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this
Section 13 should be made, how it should be made or what it should be. The
Rights Agent has no duty to determine whether any provisions of a supplemental
contingent stock rights agreement under Section 13(b) are correct. The Rights
Agent makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities
or assets issuable upon conversion of CSRs. The Rights Agent shall not be
responsible for the Companys failure to comply with this Section 13\.

 

(g) For purpose of this Section 13, the term " _shares of Menlo Common Stock_
" shall mean (i) shares of the class of stock designated as Common Stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Company as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) shares of any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or
reclassification of such shares consisting solely of changes in par value, or
from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value. In the
event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 13, the Holders of CSRs shall become entitled to receive any
securities of the Company other than, or in addition to, shares of Menlo
Common Stock, thereafter the number or amount of such other securities so
issuable upon conversion of each CSR shall be subject to adjustment from time
to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the
provisions with respect to the shares of Menlo Common Stock issuable hereunder
contained in Section 13(a), and the provisions of Section 6, Section 7,
Section 8, Section 9, Section 10 and Section 13 with respect to the shares of
Menlo Common Stock issuable hereunder or Menlo Common Stock shall apply on
like terms to any such other securities.

 



9

    

Section 13\. _No Fractional Shares_. The Company shall not be required to
issue fractional shares of Menlo Common Stock upon conversion of CSRs. If
more than one CSR shall be convertible at the same time with respect to the
same Holder, the number of full shares of Menlo Common Stock which shall be
issuable upon the conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of shares of Menlo Common Stock issuable upon the conversion
of the CSRs. If any fraction of a share of Menlo Common Stock would, except
for the provisions of this Section 13, be issuable on the conversion of any
CSRs, the Company shall pay, without interest, an amount determined by the
Current Stock Price. The " _Current Stock Price_ " shall equal the average per
share closing sale prices of Menlo Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market as
reported by the Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending
on the fifth (5th) trading date after the later of (i) the Milestone Date
or (ii) the Expiration Date.

Section 14\. _Dividends or Other Distributions_. No dividend or other
distribution declared with respect to Menlo Common Stock with a record date
prior to the Milestone Date shall be paid to Holders of CSRs. To the extent
any shares of Menlo Common Stock are issued to Holders pursuant to Section
8(a), there shall be paid to such Holders the amount of dividends or other
distributions, without interest, declared with a record date after the
Milestone Date.

Section 15.  _Notices to CSR Holders_. Upon any adjustment pursuant to
Section 13 hereof, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such
adjustment to the Rights Agent and shall cause the Rights Agent, on behalf of
and at the expense of the Company, within ten (10) days after notification is
received by the Rights Agent of such adjustment, to mail by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to each Holder a notice of such adjustment(s) and shall
deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company, setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the terms of such
adjustment(s), (ii) a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment(s) and (iii) the computation by which such adjustment(s) was made.
Where appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part
of the notice required under the other provisions of this Section 15\.

 

Section 16\. _Notices to the Company and Rights Agent_. Any notice or demand
authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the Rights Agent or by
any Holder to or on the Company shall be sufficiently given or made when
received at the office of the Company expressly designated by the Company as
its office for purposes of this Agreement (until the Rights Agent is
otherwise notified in accordance with this Section 16 by the Company), as

11

    

(iv) to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision herein that
may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make
any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this
Agreement; _provided_ that in each case, such provisions shall not adversely
affect the rights of Holders;

(v) as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that CSRs are not subject to
registration under the Securities Act or the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended and the rules and regulations made thereunder, or any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws;

 

(vi) to cancel CSRs (i) in the event that any Holder has abandoned its rights
in accordance with Section 4(c) or (ii) following the transfer of such CSRs
to the Company or its affiliates in accordance with Section 5; or

(vii) as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the Company complies
with applicable law.

In addition to the foregoing, upon the request of the Company, the Rights
Agent hereby agrees to enter into one or more amendments hereto to evidence
the succession of another person as a successor Rights Agent and the
assumption by any successor of the covenants and obligations of such Rights
Agent herein.

 

(b) With the written consent of the Holders of not less than a majority of the
then outstanding CSRs delivered to the Company, the Company may enter into
one or more amendments hereto for the purpose of adding, eliminating or
changing any provision of this Agreement if such addition, elimination or
change is in any way adverse to the rights of Holders. It shall not be
necessary for any written consent of Holders under this Section 17(b) to
approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it shall be
sufficient if such written consent shall approve the substance thereof.

 

(c) The consent of each Holder affected shall be required for any amendment
pursuant to which the number of shares of Menlo Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of CSRs would be decreased (not including adjustments contemplated
hereunder).

(d) Promptly after the execution by the Company of any amendment pursuant to

(f) The Rights Agent shall be entitled to receive and shall be fully protected
in relying upon an officers certificate and opinion of counsel as conclusive
evidence that any such amendment or supplement is authorized or permitted
hereunder, that it is not inconsistent herewith, and that it will be valid and
binding upon the Company in accordance with its terms.

 



12

    

Section 18\. _Enforcement of Rights of Holders_. Any actions seeking
enforcement of the rights of Holders hereunder may be brought either by the
Rights Agent or the Holders of a majority of the issued and then outstanding
CSRs.

 

Section 19\. _Certain Rights of the Rights Agent_. The Rights Agent undertakes
the duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms
and conditions, by all of which the Company and the Holders, by their
acceptance of CSRs, shall be bound:

(a) The statements contained herein and in any notice delivered by the
Company shall be taken as statements of the Company, and the Rights Agent
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the same except such
as describe the Rights Agent or any action taken by it. The Rights Agent
assumes no responsibility with respect to the distribution of the CSRs except
as herein otherwise provided.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company
to comply with the covenants contained in this Agreement or in the CSRs to be
complied with by the Company.

(c) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers
hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either by itself (through
its employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents (which shall not
include its employees) and shall not be responsible for the misconduct of any
agent appointed with due care.

 

(d) The Rights Agent may consult at any time with legal counsel satisfactory
to it (who may be counsel for the Company), and the Rights Agent shall incur
no liability or responsibility to the Company or to any Holder in respect of
any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in
accordance with the opinion or the advice of such counsel.

 

(e) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights
Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved
or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action
hereunder, such fact or matter (unless such evidence in respect thereof be
herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board, the
President, Chief Financial Officer, one of the Vice Presidents, the Treasurer
or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such
certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action
taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement
in reliance upon such certificate.

 

(f) The Company agrees to (i) pay the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for
all services rendered by the Rights Agent in the performance of its duties
under this Agreement as agreed upon in writing by the Rights Agent and the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) reimburse the Rights
Agent for all reasonable and properly documented out-of-pocket expenses, taxes
and governmental charges and other charges of any kind and nature incurred by
the Rights Agent (including reasonable fees and expenses of the Rights

Agreement and

 



13

    

 (iii) indemnify the Rights Agent and hold it harmless against any and all
liabilities, including judgments, costs and counsel fees, for anything done or

or willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement; or (z) the Rights Agent (or
anyone on its behalf) not complying with and/or adhering to the provisions of
the Withholding Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim Ruling, and the 104H Tax Ruling
(as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), or any other written
instructions provided by the Israel Tax Authority, or otherwise with respect
to any tax withholding made or not made by the Rights Agent (or anyone on its
behalf).

 

(g) The Rights Agent shall be under no obligation to institute any action,
suit or legal proceeding or to take any other action likely to involve
expense unless the Company or one or more Holders shall furnish the Rights
Agent with reasonable security and indemnity satisfactory to the Rights Agent
for any costs and expenses which may be incurred, but this provision shall not
affect the power of the Rights Agent to take such action as the Rights Agent
may consider proper, whether with or without any such security or indemnity.
All rights of action under this Agreement or under any of the CSRs may be
enforced by the Rights Agent, and any such action, suit or proceeding
instituted by the Rights Agent shall be brought in its name as Rights Agent,
and any recovery of judgment shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders,
as their respective rights or interests may appear.

(h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the
Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any other securities of the Company or
become pecuniarily interested in any transactions in which the Company may be
interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as
fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement or
such director, officer or employee. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights
Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal
entity, including, without limitation, acting as Transfer Agent or as a
lender to the Company or an affiliate thereof.

(i) The Rights Agent shall act hereunder solely as agent, and its duties shall
be determined solely by the provisions hereof. The Rights Agent shall not be
liable for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with
this Agreement except for (i) its own negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct; and (ii) such actions as provided in Section 19(f)(ii) above.

(j) The Rights Agent will not incur any liability or responsibility to the
Company or to any Holder for any action taken in reliance on any notice,
resolution, waiver, consent, order, certificate, or other paper, document or
instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,
sent or presented by the proper party or parties.

(k) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the
validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the
due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity of any
CSR; nor shall the Rights Agent by any act hereunder be deemed to make any
representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any
shares of Menlo Common Stock (or other stock) to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement or any CSR, or as to whether any shares of Menlo Common Stock (or
other stock) will, when issued, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

 



14

    

(l) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions
with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from the Chairman of
the Board, the President, any Vice President or the Secretary of the Company,
and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with
its duties, and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered to be
taken by it in good faith and without negligence in accordance with
instructions of any such officer or officers.

 

Section 20\. _Designation; Removal; Successor Rights Agent_. The Rights Agent
may resign at any time and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement
by giving to the Company thirty (30) days notice in writing. The Company may
remove the Rights Agent or any successor rights agent by giving to the Rights
Agent or successor rights agent thirty (30) days notice in writing. If the
Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of
acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent, subject to
the provisions of the Withholding Tax Ruling, the 104H Interim Ruling, and
the 104H Tax Ruling (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement), and
obtaining written approval from the Israel Tax Authority. If the Company shall
fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after such
removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by any Holder
(who shall with such notice submit his, her or its CSR for inspection by
the Company), then any Holder may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to the Rights Agent. Pending
appointment of a successor rights agent, either by the Company or by such
court, the duties of the Rights Agent shall be carried out by the Company.
Any successor rights agent, whether appointed by the Company or such a court,
shall be a bank or trust company in good standing, incorporated under the laws
