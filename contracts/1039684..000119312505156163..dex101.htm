8 SALE AND PURCHASE OF EQUITY INTERESTS



.1 _Sale and Purchase of Equity Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, on the Closing Date, Seller agrees to sell to
Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, the Equity Interests.



CONSIDERATION



.1 _Consideration_. The aggregate consideration for the Equity Interests shall
be an amount in cash equal to SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY ONE MILLION
DOLLARS ($791,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "), plus or minus any
adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided in _Sections 3.3_ and _3.4_.



 

.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay the
Adjusted Purchase Price (as defined below) to Seller, which shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available United States funds (not ACH) into an
account designated by Seller.



.3 _Closing Statement_. At least two (2) Business Days before Closing (the "
_Closing Statement Delivery Date_ "), Seller shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (as defined below) as of
the Effective Time (" _Initial Closing Working Capital_ ") and the
corresponding Adjusted Purchase Price to be paid at Closing (which shall
conclusively adjust the Purchase Price at Closing, absent manifest error) and
such documentation reasonably necessary to support the calculation
and adjustment. " _Net Working Capital_ " means the adjusted assets of the
Mid-Continent Business Unit, reduced by the adjusted liabilities of the Mid-
Continent Business Unit, in each case as determined in accordance with the
accounting principles set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _Agreed Principles_
"). Seller shall use the latest available information as of the Closing
Statement Delivery Date to calculate the Initial Closing Working Capital and
the Adjusted Purchase Price. The preparation of the Closing Statement shall
be for the purpose of determining the difference between Net Working Capital
as calculated in accordance with the Agreed Principles and set forth on
_Schedule 3.3(a)_  (" _Reference Working Capital_ ") and the Initial Closing
Working Capital for the purpose of determining the Adjusted Purchase Price. If
Initial Closing Working Capital exceeds Reference Working Capital, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such excess (such
increase, a " _Positive Adjustment_ ") and, if Reference Working Capital
exceeds Initial Closing Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the amount of such excess (such reduction, a " _Negative Adjustment_ "). "
_Adjusted Purchase Price_ " means the Purchase Price plus any Positive
Adjustment or the Purchase Price minus any Negative Adjustment, as applicable.



 

9 .4 _Adjusted Purchase Price Adjustment_.



(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall confirm the calculation of the Initial Closing
Working Capital as described in the Closing Statement by causing to be
prepared and delivered to Purchaser a statement (the " _Final Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers calculation of the Net Working Capital
as of the Effective Time (" _Final Closing Working Capital_ "). The
preparation of the Final Closing Statement shall be for the purpose of
confirming the calculation of the Initial Closing Working Capital.



(b) If Purchaser disagrees with Sellers calculation of Final Closing Working
Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ , Purchaser may, within fifteen
(15) days after receipt of the Final Closing Statement, deliver a notice to
Seller disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Purchasers
calculation of such amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event the
Closing Date falls on a date other than an accounting month-end of the Mid-
Continent Business Unit, Purchaser may only deliver a notice to Seller
disagreeing with Sellers calculation of Final Closing Working Capital if
Purchasers calculation of the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than
Sellers calculation of Final Closing Working Capital by more than 10%. Any
such notice of disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those items or
amounts as to which Purchaser disagrees, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Final
Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_.



(c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to _Section
3.4(b)_ , Seller and Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15) days after such
delivery, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of Final Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be more than
the amount thereof shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(a)_ nor less than the amount thereof shown in Purchasers
calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(b)_. If during such period,
Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly
thereafter cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") to
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of
calculating Final Closing Working Capital (it being understood that in making
such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an expert
and not as an arbitrator). In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee
shall consider only those items or amounts in the Final Closing Statement and
Sellers calculation of Final Closing Working Capital as to which Purchaser
has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Seller and Purchaser,
as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days
from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting
forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Seller
and Purchaser. The cost of such review and report shall be borne
proportionately by Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for
the proportion of such cost equal to the quotient of (A) the absolute value
of the difference of (w) Purchasers calculation of Final Working Capital (as
defined below) minus (x) the Final Working Capital divided by (B) the absolute
value of the difference of (y) Purchasers calculation of Final Working
Capital minus (z) Sellers  



 

10  calculation of Final Working Capital. Seller shall be responsible for the
proportion of such cost equal to the quotient of (A) the absolute value of
the difference of (w) Sellers calculation of Final Working Capital minus (x)
the Final Working Capital divided by (B) the absolute value of the difference
of (y) Sellers calculation of Final Working Capital minus (z)
Purchasers calculation of Final Working Capital.



(d) Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives to, and Purchaser shall cause the Companies and their
respective representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the
Final Closing Statement and the calculation of Final Closing Working Capital
and in the conduct of the review referred to in this _Section 3.4_ , including
the making available to the extent necessary of books, records, work papers
and personnel.



(e) If Final Working Capital exceeds Initial Closing Working
Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, in the manner and with interest as
provided in _Section 3.4(f)_ , the amount of such excess and, if Initial
Closing Working Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser in the manner and with interest as provided in _Section 3.4(f)_ ,
the amount of the excess of Initial Closing Working Capital over Final Working
Capital. " _Final Working Capital_ " means Final Closing Working Capital (i)
as shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ , if
no notice of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(b)_ ; or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A)
as agreed by Seller and Purchaser pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_ or (B) in the
absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referees calculation
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(c)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Final Working Capital be more than Sellers calculation of Final
Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to _Section 3.4(a)_ or less than
Purchasers calculation of Final Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to
_Section 3.4(b)_.



(f) Any payment pursuant to _Section 3.4(e)_  shall be made at a mutually
convenient time and place within five (5) Business Days after Final Working
Capital has been determined by wire transfer by Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, of immediately available United States funds (not ACH) to the
account of such other party as may be designated in writing by such other
party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.4_
shall bear interest from and including the Effective Time to but excluding the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest published
from time to time by the _Wall Street Journal_ (under the heading "Money
Rates") as the "prime rate" at large U.S. money center banks during the period
from the Effective Time to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty five (365) days
and the actual number of days elapsed.

further that such date may be extended by Seller for up to two consecutive

_Sections 8.1(d)_ and _8.2(d)_ remain unsatisfied or unwaived at the first
annual anniversary of the date hereof;

be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after

Knowledge of Seller, the Companies and the Subsidiaries own or have valid
licenses to use all Intellectual Property used by them in the Ordinary Course

the subject of any challenge received by any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries in writing.

maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by the Companies
(each, a " _Company Benefit Plan_ "). Seller has made available to Purchaser
correct and complete copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case
of any such Company Benefit Plan that is unwritten, descriptions thereof) and
(ii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan
for which such summary plan description is required. Each Company Benefit
Plan maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by any of
the Companies or the Subsidiaries has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms. The Companies, the Subsidiaries and all
of the Company Benefit Plans are all in compliance with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws with respect to
employee benefit matters, except for any noncompliance that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

"employee pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that is
intended to be tax qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (each, a "
_Company Pension Plan_ ") that is maintained, contributed to, or required to
be contributed to by any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries is so qualified
and (ii) no event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination
letter or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that
would adversely affect the qualification of such Company Pension Plan. Seller

determination letter received by the Companies with respect to each Company
Pension Plan maintained, contributed to, or required to be contributed to by
any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, as well as a correct and complete

(c) All contributions, premiums, and benefit payments under or in connection
with the Company Benefit Plans that are required to have been made as of the
date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans have
been timely made or have been reflected on the most recent Balance Sheet. No

19 written notice of or been charged with the violation of any Laws, except where
such violation would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; and



(b) the Companies and the Subsidiaries currently have all Permits that are
necessary to operate their respective businesses as currently conducted,
except where the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither of the Companies nor any of the Subsidiaries

the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any
term, condition or provision of any Permit to which it is a party, except

Material Adverse Effect.

acted, directly or indirectly, as a broker, finder or financial advisor for
Seller or the Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated by

continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights
shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect

any Indemnitee under this _Section 7.7_ , as incurred to the fullest extent

asserted or made, any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an Indemnitees conduct complies with the standards set forth under
applicable Law, the applicable organizational documents of any of the
Companies or the Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
shall be made by independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnitee.

benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 7.7_.



(f) The obligations of Purchaser under this _Section 7.7_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnitee
to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies without the consent of the affected
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this
_Section 7.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this  _Section
7.7_ ).

Subsidiaries to preserve and keep the records relating to the Companies and
the Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or, if

Subsidiaries to make such records and personnel available as may be reasonably
required by Seller in connection with, among other things, any insurance
claims or indemnification claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits against
or governmental investigations of Seller or any of its Affiliates or in order
to enable Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement

thereby. In the event Purchaser wishes to destroy such records after that
time, Purchaser shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries first to give
ninety (90) days prior written notice to Seller, and Seller shall have the
right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to Purchaser
within that ninety (90) day period, to take possession of the records within
one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of such notice.



.9 _Publicity_.



(a) Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Companies
and the Subsidiaries not to, issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
unless, in the reasonable judgment of Seller or Purchaser, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law, provided that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult
with the other party with respect to the text thereof.



(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller agree that the terms of this Agreement shall
not be disclosed or otherwise made available to the public and that copies of
this Agreement shall not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to
the public, except where such disclosure, availability or filing is required
by applicable Law and only to the extent required by such Law. In the event
that such disclosure, availability or filing is required by applicable Law,
each of Purchaser and Seller, as applicable, agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain "confidential treatment" of this Agreement with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (or the equivalent treatment by
any other Governmental Body) and to redact such terms of this Agreement as
the other party may request.



.10 _Use of Name_. Purchaser agrees that (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates has any right, title or interest in or to the name "Koch" or any
service marks, trademarks, trade names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems,
signs or insignia related thereto (including any pipeline markers) or
containing or comprising the foregoing, including any derivations,
modifications or alterations thereof, and any word, name or mark confusingly
similar thereto (collectively, the " _Koch Marks_ "), (ii) neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right to use the Koch Marks after the
Closing Date, except that Purchaser may use pipeline markers that contain the
Koch Marks for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date, and (iii) Purchaser shall immediately after the Closing change
the name of KUS and Koch Hydrocarbon, LP to any name other than the Koch Marks
and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates to, otherwise
cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with Seller or any of its
Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Koch Marks from all
materials including any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery,
packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms,
computer software,  



 

29  technical guidelines, standards and procedures and other materials (other
than with respect to pipeline markers, which shall be removed within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date).



.11 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.



(a) _Employees_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the employment of the
Continuing Employees will not terminate because of the Closing and that such
employment of the Continuing Employees shall continue after the Closing.



(b) _Benefits_.



(i) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, or such longer
period of time required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall provide Continuing
Employees, who remain employed with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser,
with (a) compensation (including salary, wages and opportunities for
commissions, overtime and premium pay, but excluding bonuses and incentive
pay) and a position of employment that are, in each case, at least
substantially equivalent to those provided to such Continuing Employees
immediately before the Effective Time and (b) bonuses and incentive pay and
employee benefits at least as favorable as those provided by Purchaser to its
similarly situated employees immediately before the Effective Time.



(ii) For purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual, except
in the case of vacation and sick leave which shall continue post-Closing)
under the employee benefit plans or pension plans of Purchaser providing
benefits to Continuing Employees (the " _Purchaser Plans_ "), Purchaser shall
credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the
Companies, the Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately before the Effective Time
to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan. The
Purchaser Plans shall not deny Continuing Employees coverage on the basis of
pre-existing conditions and shall credit such Continuing Employees in the year
of initial participation in the Purchaser Plans for any deductibles and out-
of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees under the Company Benefit
Plans. Seller shall provide to Purchaser within ninety (90) days after the
Closing a listing of deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for the current
year for those Continuing Employees and their dependents who provide
authorization for release of such data.



(iii) Purchaser shall provide and be solely responsible for any continuation
coverage required under Section 4980 of the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
or applicable state law (" _COBRA_ ") to each Continuing Employee or any
person related to such Continuing Employee who is a "qualified beneficiary" as
that term is defined in COBRA whose first "qualifying event" (as defined in
COBRA) occurs on or before the Closing.



 

30 (iv) Purchaser shall permit each Continuing Employee to elect on the Closing
Date (or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable) a direct rollover of
his or her rolloverable account balance under the Company Benefit Plan that is
a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "
_Company Savings Plan_ ") to a defined contribution plan designated by
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Savings Plan_ "), and Seller shall cause the
Company Savings Plan to deliver to the Purchaser Savings Plan as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date the promissory notes and other
loan documentation, if any, of the Continuing Employees who have elected such
a direct rollover in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Seller.
Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept the direct
rollover of electing Continuing Employees benefits in cash and, if
applicable, promissory notes that are distributed from the Company Savings
Plan.



(v) If, within two (2) years after the Closing Date, (a) the employment of any
Continuing Employee is terminated by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
for a reason other than cause (as that term is defined in Purchasers
severance plan) or (b) a Continuing Employee leaves his or her employment as a
result of the decision by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser to relocate
the place of employment of any Continuing Employee that is greater than a
fifty (50) mile radius from the Continuing Employees place of employment
immediately before the Effective Time, then, in either case, Purchaser shall
provide such Continuing Employee the greater of (x) such severance benefits as
Purchaser and its Affiliates make available to their similarly situated
employees and (y) severance benefits equal to two (2) weeks of such
Continuing Employees salary for every year of service with Purchaser, Seller
or their respective Affiliates, not to exceed fifty-two (52) weeks of such
Continuing Employees salary. For purposes of calculating the amount of any
severance compensation in respect of such severance benefit, Purchaser shall
take into account each Continuing Employees years of service with the
Companies, the Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately before the Closing to
credit for such service.



(vi) Seller acknowledges that Purchaser is not assuming nor shall Purchaser
otherwise be liable for any obligations of Seller under any Company Benefit
Plan; and Purchaser acknowledges that Seller is not assuming nor shall Seller
otherwise be liable for any obligations of Purchaser under any Purchaser Plan.



.12 _Non-Solicitation_.



(a) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
employees who are or, after the Closing Date, become employees of Seller or
its Affiliates to leave their employment with Seller or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit general
solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward employees of
Seller or its Affiliates or the hiring of such employees in response  



 

31  thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any employee of Seller
or its Affiliates who presents himself or herself for employment without
direct or indirect solicitation by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser.



(b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, cause, solicit, induce or encourage any
Continuing Employees to leave their employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates;  _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit
general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward
Continuing Employees or the hiring of such employees in response thereto, nor
the hiring, employment or engagement of any Continuing Employee who presents
himself or herself for employment without direct or indirect solicitation by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.



.13 _Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules_. From time to time before the
Closing, Seller shall have the right to supplement or amend the Schedules
with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the delivery
of the Schedules pursuant to this Agreement. No such supplement or amendment
shall have any effect on the satisfaction of the condition to Closing set
forth in  _Section 8.1(a)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Closing shall
occur, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any right or claim
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to
_Article IX_  hereof, with respect to any and all matters disclosed pursuant
to any such supplement or amendment at or before the Closing.



.14 _Company Guarantees_.



(a) Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Seller, on or before the Closing, valid and binding written releases of
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries), as
applicable, from any liability or obligation, whether arising before, on or
after the Closing Date, under any Company Guarantees in effect as of the
Closing, including by providing substitute guarantees with terms that are at
least as favorable to the counterparty as the terms of the applicable Company
Guarantees and by furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow
arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds or making other arrangements
as the counterparty may reasonably request. If any Company Guarantee has not
been released as of the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall continue to use
its commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing to cause each such
unreleased Company Guarantee to be released promptly.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge and agree that at any time on or after the Closing Date, Seller
and its Affiliates may, in their sole discretion, take any action to
terminate, obtain release of or otherwise limit their liability under any and
all outstanding Company Guarantees.



(c) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and after the Closing for any Losses arising out of or relating to any
Company Guarantees.



 

32 .15 _Intercompany Contracts; Intercompany Balances_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 7.15_ , all contracts, agreements and arrangements (including any
Tax sharing or allocation agreements) between and among any of the Companies
or the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be
terminated in their entirety effective as of the Effective Time by the parties
and shall be deemed voided, cancelled and discharged in their entirety. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 7.15_ , all intercompany balances between and among
any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, shall be eliminated by capital contribution, discharge or
otherwise in their entirety effective as of the Effective Time.



.16 _Tax Matters_.



(a)  _Allocation of Purchase Price_. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the determination of Final Working
Capital, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the Adjusted Purchase Price among (i)
the assets of NGL and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the Shares in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.
Further, upon the request of Purchaser, Seller shall join with Purchaser in
making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder and any corresponding or similar elections
under state, local or foreign tax law (collectively, the " _Section
338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to KUS, and Purchaser shall include in
such Allocation Statement an allocation of the amount referred to in _Section
7.16(a)(ii)_ among the assets and liabilities of KUS determined in accordance
with Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Purchaser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of
all forms and documents required to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, which shall be subject to the prior approval of Seller. Seller shall
have fifteen (15) days to review the Allocation Statement and shall notify
Purchaser of any disputes with the allocation as set forth in the
Allocation Statement. Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such dispute before the date that is sixty (60) days before the
due date of the Tax Returns that reflect the allocation. If Seller and
Purchaser cannot resolve the disputed allocation before such date, then
Seller and Purchaser shall refer the dispute to the Accounting Referee to
review and to determine the proper allocation (it being understood that in
making such determination, the Accounting Referee shall be functioning as an
expert and not as an arbitrator). The Accounting Referee shall deliver to
Seller and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no later
than thirty (30) days from the date of engagement of the Accounting Referee),
a determination of the allocation. This determination will be binding on the
parties hereto and all Tax Returns filed by Purchaser, Seller or the Companies
and each of their Affiliates shall be prepared consistently with such
allocation. The cost of such review and report shall be borne by Purchaser.



(b) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall file or cause to be filed all Income Tax
Returns required to be filed by or with respect to KUS or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending at or before the Tax Effective
Time, determined as provided in  



 

33   _Section 7.16(c)_. Purchaser shall file all other Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries, provided that Purchaser shall provide Seller with a copy of any
Tax Return to be filed by or with respect to any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins at or before the Tax Effective
Time at least twenty (20) days before the date of filing for Sellers review
and consent.



(c) _Allocation of Income Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser shall, unless
prohibited by applicable state or local law, cause KUS or any of its
Subsidiaries to close the Income Tax period of KUS and each of its
Subsidiaries at the Tax Effective Time. If applicable Law does not permit KUS
or any of its Subsidiaries to close its Income Tax period at the Tax Effective
Time, the amount of Income Taxes allocable to the portion of such period
ending at the Tax Effective Time shall be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended at the Tax Effective
Time. Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Income
Taxes relating to such period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant taxable period ended at the Tax Effective Time and by means of a
closing of the books and records of KUS or any of its Subsidiaries at the Tax
Effective Time; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending at
the Tax Effective Time and the period after the Tax Effective Time in
proportion to the number of days in each such period. All Tax Returns filed
by Purchaser, Seller or the Companies and each of their Affiliates shall be
prepared consistently with such allocation. Neither Seller, KUS, any of its
Subsidiaries nor Purchaser shall make an election under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any similar provision of state or local tax
law) to ratably allocate Tax items for any year or taxable period that
includes the Closing Date. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree to apply
the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign tax law) to any transactions
occurring on the Closing Date and after the Effective Time. Any transaction
shall be reported on KUS Income Tax Return for the taxable period beginning
on the day following the Closing Date.



(d) _Tax Refunds_. Any refund or credit (including any interest with respect
thereto) of Income Taxes of KUS and its Subsidiaries attributable to
any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined under _Section 7.16(c)_ )
ending at or before the Tax Effective Time shall be the property of Seller,
and if such refund or credit is received by Purchaser, KUS or its Subsidiaries
or any of their Affiliates, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of such
refund or credit and pay over to Seller the amount of such refund or credit.



(e) _Tax Contests_. If notice of any claim, audit, examination, or other
proposed change or adjustment by any taxing authority, as well as any
notice of assessment and any notice and demand for payment, concerning any
Income Taxes for any taxable period (or portion thereof, as determined under
_Section 7.16(c)_ ) ending at or before the Tax Effective Time (a " _Tax
Proceeding_ ") shall be received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall promptly
inform Seller in writing of such Tax Proceeding. Seller shall have the right,
at its expense to represent the interests of KUS or any of its Subsidiaries  



 

34  and control the prosecution, defense and settlement of any Tax Proceeding
relating exclusively to taxable periods ending at or before the Tax Effective
Time. Purchaser shall represent, at its expense, the interests of KUS or any
of its Subsidiaries in any Tax Proceeding relating to any taxable period that
begins at or before the Tax Effective Time and ends after the Tax Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Purchaser shall allow Seller and its
counsel to participate in any such Tax Proceeding at Sellers sole expense;
(ii) Purchaser shall keep Seller fully and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of such Tax Proceeding; and (iii) if the
results of any such Tax Proceeding involve an issue that is the subject of
indemnification by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2_ or for which a refund may
be available to Seller, then Purchaser and Seller shall, subject to the
indemnification procedures set forth in _Section 9.4_ to the extent not
inconsistent with this _Section 7.16(e)_ , jointly control the prosecution,
defense and settlement of any such Tax Proceeding, each party shall cooperate
with the other party at its own expense and there shall be no settlement or
closing or other agreement with respect thereto without the consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(f) _Exclusivity_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Section 7.16_ , on the one hand, and the provisions of _Article IX_ , on the
other, the provisions of this _Section 7.16_ shall control.



(g) _Carry Back of Losses_. Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and shall not
cause or permit KUS or any of its Subsidiaries to, carry back to any taxable
period ending at or before the Tax Effective Time any net operating loss or
other Tax attribute and further agrees that Seller has no obligation under
this Agreement or otherwise to return or remit any refund or other Tax
benefit attributable to a breach by Purchaser of the foregoing undertaking.



(h) _Pre-Closing Periods_. Purchaser shall not make any Tax elections that
would affect Seller or any of its Affiliates (including KUS and its
Subsidiaries) for any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined under
_Section 7.16(c)_ ) ending at or before the Tax Effective Time.



.17  _Insurance_.



(a) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries not to, assert any right, claim or interest to or under any
insurance policies or rights to proceeds thereof (other than any workers
compensation policy) in effect on or before the Closing Date relating to any
of the Companies or the Subsidiaries. In furtherance thereof, Purchaser, on
behalf of itself and each of the Companies and the Subsidiaries, hereby waives
any and all rights to or under any such insurance policies.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 7.17(a)_ , if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, (i) any loss or damage to the
improvements or other tangible personal property of any of the Companies or
the Subsidiaries shall occur from fire, casualty or any other occurrence, (ii)
Seller does not at its discretion replace or restore such property before the
Effective Time and (iii) the Closing occurs, then all  



 

35  insurance proceeds received by Seller or any of the Companies or the
Subsidiaries as a result of the event causing such loss or damage (net of
any retrospective premium, payback or similar obligations in applicable
insurance policies) will be delivered by Seller to Purchaser. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not otherwise have any obligation to replace
or restore any such property if such insurance proceeds are assigned to
Purchaser. Seller shall have the sole right and authority to provide notices
and claims to the applicable insurance carrier and otherwise to communicate
and negotiate with such carrier, but shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any such proceeds payable to Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the benefit of any insurance proceeds in relation to "business
interruption" damages based upon lost profits or business opportunities in
respect of the period before the Effective Time, and insurance proceeds in
relation to such loss or damage to the extent attributable to any such
property replaced or restored before the Effective Time or otherwise used for
such purposes, will inure to the benefit of and be payable to Seller, and
Purchaser will not be entitled to receive or retain such proceeds.

38 (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall not have any liability
under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that such

the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice in
reasonable detail of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which it
has knowledge that is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the

option and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, which must be
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, and to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim that
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder. If the indemnifying
party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
Indemnification Claim that relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, it shall within ninety (90) days notify the indemnified party of
its intent to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim that
relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder, the indemnified party may
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Indemnification
Claim. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Indemnification Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of such Indemnification Claim; _provided_ , _however_

defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party if, (i)
so requested by the indemnifying  



 

39  party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
indemnified parties in connection with any Indemnification Claim. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Indemnification Claim.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 9.4_  to the contrary, neither the
indemnifying party nor the indemnified party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Indemnification Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless the claimant and
such party provide to such other party an unqualified release from all
liability in respect of the Indemnification Claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by the
applicable third party claimant, and the indemnifying party notifies the
indemnified party in writing of the indemnifying partys willingness to accept
the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable limitations of _Section
9.5_ , pay the amount called for by such offer, and the indemnified party
declines to accept such offer, the indemnified party may continue to contest
such Indemnification Claim, free of any participation by the indemnifying
party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such
Indemnification Claim that the indemnifying party has an obligation to pay
hereunder, subject to the applicable limitations of _Section 9.5_ , shall be
limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement offer that
the indemnified party declined to accept plus the Losses of the indemnified
party relating to such Indemnification Claim through the date of its rejection
of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Indemnification Claim. If the indemnifying party makes
any payment on any Indemnification Claim, the indemnifying party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
indemnified party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the
indemnified party with respect to such Indemnification Claim.



(b) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in
which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a
mutually binding agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any
sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter.



.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.



(a) A Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert an Indemnification Claim pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to representations and warranties of the
Seller only to the extent the Purchaser Indemnified Party gives notice of the
Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ before the expiration of
the applicable time period set forth in _Section 9.1_ for such
representation and warranty. A Purchaser Indemnified Party may assert an
Indemnification Claim pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section
9.2(a)(iii)_ , as the case may be, only to the extent the Purchaser
Indemnified Party gives notice of the Indemnification Claim in accordance
with _Section 9.4(a)_ before  



 

40  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the matters
indemnified under _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_.
Any Indemnification Claim not made in accordance with _Section 9.4(a)_ by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties on or before the applicable date set forth in
_Section 9.1_ or herein, and Sellers indemnification obligations with
respect thereto, will be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article IX_ , Seller shall not
have any indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ ,
(i) for any individual item where the Loss relating thereto is less than
$100,000 and (ii) in respect of each individual item where the Loss relating
thereto is equal to or greater than $100,000, unless the aggregate amount of
all such Losses exceeds three (3%) percent of the Purchase Price, and then
only to the extent of such excess. In no event shall the aggregate amount of
Losses to be paid by Seller under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceed ten (10%) percent
of the Purchase Price.



(c) No representation or warranty of Seller contained herein shall be deemed
untrue or incorrect, and Seller shall not be deemed to have breached a
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of any fact,
circumstance or event of which (i) is disclosed in response to
another representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or (ii)
Purchaser is aware as of the Closing Date.



(d) No Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification
under this _Article IX_ in respect of any matter that is taken into account
in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Sections 3.3_ and _3.4_.



(e) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered or recoverable by
the indemnified party under insurance policies or otherwise, and net of any
Tax benefit realized by Purchaser with respect to such Losses.



(f) For purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses for which
indemnification for any breach of any representation or warranty is provided
under this  _Article IX_ (but not for purposes of determining whether any
particular representation or warranty contained herein has been breached), any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the applicable
representations or warranties shall be ignored.



(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article V_ (as modified by the Schedules hereto),
neither Seller nor any other Person is making any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Seller, the Companies, the
Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and Seller disclaims any representations or warranties,
whether made by Seller, the Companies or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives. Any claims a
Purchaser Indemnified Party may have for breach of representation or warranty
shall be based solely on the  



 

41  representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article V_ (as
modified by the Schedules hereto as supplemented or amended). In furtherance
of the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Article V_ (as modified by the Schedules hereto), Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges and
agrees that none of the Companies, Seller, any of their respective Affiliates
or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to a Purchaser
Indemnified Party or any other Person for, and Seller hereby disclaims all
liability and responsibility for, any representation, warranty, projection,
forecast, statement, or information made, communicated, or furnished (orally
or in writing) to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives, including
any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf of the Companies relating to
any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries or other publications or data room
information provided to Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives, or any
other document or information in any form provided to Purchaser or
its Affiliates or representatives in connection with the sale of the Equity
Interests and the transactions contemplated hereby (including any opinion,
information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to
Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives by any director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the Companies or Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates) or for Purchasers use of any such
information.



(h) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the condition, operations,
assets (including all activated and deactivated pipelines) and business of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties has relied on the results of Purchasers independent
investigation. The disclosure of any matter or item in any schedule hereto
shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is
required to be disclosed.



(i) Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, acknowledges that the properties of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries have asbestos-containing materials. Seller hereby disclaims
all liability and responsibility with respect to any claims or Liabilities
arising therefrom or related thereto, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
each of the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, acknowledges that it shall
have no claims against Seller with respect thereto.



.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser agree to treat
any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article IX_ as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes.



.7 _N O CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT OR PROVIDED FOR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE
LAW, NO PARTY SHALL, IN ANY EVENT, BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PERSON, EITHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT, FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF SUCH OTHER PERSON, INCLUDING LOSS OF FUTURE REVENUE,
INCOME OR PROFITS, DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS REPUTATION OR
OPPORTUNITY RELATING TO THE BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH HEREOF, WHETHER OR  



 

42  NOT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES HAS BEEN DISCLOSED TO THE OTHER PARTY
IN ADVANCE OR COULD HAVE BEEN REASONABLY FORESEEN BY SUCH OTHER PARTY
(PROVIDED THAT SUCH LIMITATION SHALL NOT LIMIT SELLERS RIGHT TO RECOVER
CONTRACT DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH PURCHASERS FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE
CLOSING IN VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT). THE EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS SET FORTH IN THE
PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY SUCH DAMAGES SOUGHT BY THIRD
PARTIES AGAINST A PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY OR A SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY,
AS THE CASE MAY BE, IN CONNECTION WITH LOSSES THAT MAY BE INDEMNIFIED
PURSUANT TO THIS  _A RTICLE IX_.



.8  _E XCLUSIVE REMEDY_. SELLER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER
SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AND PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH OF
THE OTHER PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, SUBJECT
TO _S ECTION 10.12_, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OR
INACCURACY, OR ALLEGED BREACH OR INACCURACY, OF ANY REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL BE INDEMNIFICATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS _A RTICLE
IX_. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, SELLER, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH
OF THE OTHER SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AND PURCHASER, ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND EACH OF THE OTHER PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, HEREBY WAIVE,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL OTHER RIGHTS,
CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION (INCLUDING RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY) THAT
MAY BE BASED UPON, ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY TORT
OR BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR AS AN INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT), KNOWN OR
UNKNOWN, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, WHICH EXIST OR MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE, THAT
IT MAY HAVE AGAINST THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES OR THE PURCHASER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, AS THE CASE MAY BE, ARISING UNDER OR BASED UPON ANY
FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAW (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LAW RELATING TO
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS OR ARISING UNDER OR BASED UPON ANY SECURITIES LAW,
COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE).



.9 _No Transfer of Seller s Indemnities_. If Purchaser sells, assigns or
otherwise transfers, by operation of law or otherwise, any or all of the
Equity Interests to any Person, other than an Affiliate of Purchaser, then
Sellers indemnities pursuant to _Section 9.2_ relating to such transferred
Equity Interests, or portion thereof, shall automatically and immediately
extinguish.

contemplated by this Agreement shall be  



 

43  borne by Purchaser. At Closing, Purchaser shall remit such Taxes resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Seller or
otherwise provide for the payment of such Taxes in a manner satisfactory to
Seller. In the event Seller receives written notice assessing Taxes from any
tax authority after the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes, Purchaser
shall within ten (10) days of receiving written notice from Seller of such
Taxes, remit such amounts to Seller.



.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of Seller
and Purchaser shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.



.3 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_.



(a) Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller Indemnified
Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery over any dispute arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
dispute or any suit, action or proceeding related thereto may be heard and
determined in such court. Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Seller Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of
the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection that they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of Seller, on behalf of itself and each of the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of the other
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, hereto agrees that a judgment in any such

making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any  



 

44  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach
or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of
any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.



.5 _Governing Law_. The provisions of this Agreement, all of the documents
delivered pursuant hereto, their execution, performance or nonperformance,
interpretation, construction and all matters based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this

.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is

policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless

this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by

the parties under this Agreement, to the extent all of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have either been satisfied or waived and a
party to this Agreement fails to consummate the Closing, the other party
hereto shall have the right to seek a decree of specific performance to cause
the breaching party to so consummate the Closing.
