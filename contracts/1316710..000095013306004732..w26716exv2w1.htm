<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.03 <U>Exchange Procedures</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Exchange and Paying Agent</U>. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time,
Acquiror shall appoint an institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange and
Paying Agent (the &#147;<B><I>Exchange Agent</I></B>&#148;) in accordance with an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Company for the payment or exchange, as applicable, in accordance with this <U>Article&nbsp;3</U>, of
the Merger Consideration (collectively, such cash and securities being referred to as the &#147;<B><I>Exchange
Fund</I></B>&#148;). On or before the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration, for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Partnership
LP Units (including Partnership LTIP Units), as applicable. Acquiror, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, payments
of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All expenses of the Exchange Agent shall be
paid by Acquiror or the Surviving Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock and Uncertificated Partnership LP
Units</U>. Promptly after the Company Merger Effective Time (but in any event within five (5)
Business Days), Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each person who immediately
prior to the Company Merger Effective Time held Shares that were exchanged for the right to receive
the Company Merger Consideration (each, a &#147;<B><I>Former Equityholder</I></B>&#148;), pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.01</U>:
(i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that, if applicable, delivery of Certificates
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass to the Exchange Agent,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Acquiror may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;if applicable,
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Former Equityholder&#146;s Certificates in
exchange for the Company Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. Upon (i)
surrender by a Former Equityholder of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the Company as may be appointed by Acquiror,
and (ii)&nbsp;delivery by such Former Equityholder of such letter of transmittal (together with such
Certificate, if applicable), duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, such Former
Equityholder shall receive in exchange therefor the Company Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the Shares, pursuant to the provisions of this <U>Article&nbsp;3</U>, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The right of any Former Equityholder to receive the
Company Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding
obligation as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.06</U>. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Acquiror that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this <U>Section&nbsp;3.03</U>, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Company Merger
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Company Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;3.03</U>. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
Partnership Merger Cash Consideration to the holders of Partnership LP Units as set forth in the
records of the Partnership in accordance with their respective Partnership Unit Elections. The Surviving Partnership shall arrange for the
issuance of the Partnership Merger Common Unit Consideration and Partnership Unit Preferred Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Partnership Unit Elections.

or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Acquiror or Surviving Company, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Acquiror or Surviving Company may require

Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror upon demand. Any such holders who have not complied
with this <U>Article </U>3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Acquiror, and Acquiror
shall thereafter be liable, for payment of the Company Merger Consideration or Partnership Cash
Merger Consideration, as applicable (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws). Any
such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares or Partnership LP Units
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Acquiror free and clear of all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>No Liability</U>. None of Acquiror, Merger Subsidiary, Partnership Merger Subsidiary,

Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.
