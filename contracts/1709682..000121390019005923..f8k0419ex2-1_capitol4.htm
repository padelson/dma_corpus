agree in writing; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Marketing Period has not ended prior to the time of the satisfaction or waiver
of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article X_ (other than conditions

as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso). The date on which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing

Business Days) after the occurrence of any of the following (any one or more
of which may occur at the same time), Acquiror shall issue, up to an
additional 1,800,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the " _Earnout Shares_
") to the NESCO Owner as additional consideration for the Transactions (and
without the need for additional consideration from the NESCO Owner), fully
paid and free and clear of all Liens other than applicable Securities Law
restrictions:

  



  

(i) if the Acquiror Common Stock Price is greater than $13.00 (such share
price as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ , the " _Minimum Target_ ")
for any period of 20 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading days, 900,000
shares of Acquiror Common Stock; and

  



  

(ii) if the Acquiror Common Stock Price is greater than $16.00 (such share
price as adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ , the " _Maximum Target_ ")
for any period of 20 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading days, 900,000
shares of Acquiror Common Stock _plus_ the amount of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ , if not
previously issued.

  



     

19

 



      



  

(b) Upon the first Change in Control to occur during the Earnout Period,
Acquiror shall, no later than immediately prior to the consummation of such
Change in Control, issue to the NESCO Owner as additional consideration for
the Transactions (and without the need for additional consideration from the
NESCO Owner), free and clear of all Liens other than applicable Securities Law
restrictions, a number of Earnout Shares equal to the following:

  



  

(i) if the Change in Control Consideration paid or payable to the
stockholders of Acquiror in connection with such Change in Control is equal
to or greater than the Minimum Target but less than the Maximum Target,
900,000 shares of Acquiror Common Stock less any shares of Acquiror Common
Stock previously issued pursuant to _Section 2.06(a)(i)_ ; and

  



  

(ii) if the Change in Control Consideration paid or payable to the
stockholders of Acquiror in connection with such Change in Control is equal
to or greater than the Maximum Target, 1,800,000 shares of Acquiror Common
Stock less any shares of Acquiror Common Stock previously issued pursuant to
_Section 2.06(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.06(a)(ii)_.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Change in Control Consideration paid or
payable to the stockholders of Acquiror in connection with the first Change in
Control to occur during the Earnout Period is less than the Minimum Target,
then no Earnout Shares shall be issuable pursuant to this _Section 2.06(b)_.

  



  

(c) At all times during the Earnout Period, Acquiror shall keep available for
issuance a sufficient number of unissued shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
permit Acquiror to satisfy its issuance obligations set forth in this _Section
2.06_ and shall take all actions required to increase the authorized number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient
unissued shares of Acquiror Common Stock to permit such reservation.

  



  

(d) Acquiror shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by the NESCO
Owner to evidence the issuances pursuant to this _Section 2.06_ , including,
if requested, through the delivery of duly and validly executed certificates
or instruments representing the Earnout Shares.

  



  

(e) If Acquiror shall at any time during the Earnout Period pay any dividend
on shares of Acquiror Stock by the issuance of additional shares of Acquiror
Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
outstanding shares of Acquiror Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into
a greater or lesser number of shares of Acquiror Stock, then in each such
case, (i) the number of Earnout Shares shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares
of Acquiror Stock (including any other shares so reclassified as Acquiror
Stock) outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which
is the number of shares of Acquiror Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to such event, and (ii) the Acquiror Common Stock Price values set
forth in _Sections 2.06(a)(i)_ and (ii) above shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide to the NESCO Owner the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

  



     

20

 



      



  

(f) During the Earnout Period, Acquiror shall use reasonable efforts for (i)
Acquiror to remain listed as a public company on, and for the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock (including, when issued, the Earnout Shares) to be
tradable over, an Approved Stock Exchange and (ii) the Earnout Shares, when
issued, to be approved for listing on an Approved Stock Exchange; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not limit Acquiror from consummating a Change
in Control or entering into a Contract that contemplates a Change in Control.
Upon the consummation of any Change in Control during the Earnout Period,
other than as set forth in _Section 2.06(b) _ above, Acquiror shall have no
further obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.06(f)_.

respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash

consideration otherwise paid or delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, such amounts that any such Person is required

Indenture (the " _Second Lien Notes Redemption_ ") that is conditioned upon
the substantially simultaneous occurrence of the Closing. In connection
therewith, (i) the Second Lien Notes Issuers shall promptly prepare a
redemption notice, as well as all other customary certificates, opinions, or

the Second Lien Notes Redemption), Acquiror shall provide, or arrange for
the Debt Financing Sources to provide, to the Company and the Second Lien
Notes Issuers the funds necessary to consummate the Second Lien Notes
Redemption. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Second Lien Notes Issuers to mail the Redemption Documents to the holders of
the Second Lien Notes promptly following the commencement of the Second Lien
Notes Redemption; provided, however, that all mailings to the holders of the
Second Lien Notes in connection with the Second Lien Notes Redemption and all

be subject to the prior review, comment and approval of each of Acquiror and
the Company, which review, comment and approval shall not be

cause its counsel to provide any legal opinions required by the Indenture or
as may be reasonably requested by the trustee in connection with the Second
Lien Notes Redemption. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
Acquiror may, by written notice to the Company, require the Company to cause

Notes Indenture and the other provisions of the Second Lien Notes Indenture;
provided that prior to or simultaneously with the Company's being required to
take any of the actions pursuant to this clause (ii), Acquiror shall have, or
shall have caused to be, deposited with the trustee under the Second Lien
Notes Indenture in a timely manner sufficient funds to effect such redemption
and satisfaction and discharge in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Second Lien Notes Indenture and the procedures of The Depository Trust
Company. The redemption and satisfaction and discharge of the Second Lien
Notes pursuant to the preceding sentence are referred to collectively as the "
_Discharge_ " of the Second Lien Notes.

Acquiror (i) copies of customary payoff letters (or other customary
evidence), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, with

receipt of the amounts set forth therein and (ii) drafts of releases in
customary form (including UCC-3 termination statements, termination of any
account control agreements, releases of mortgages and terminations for any
intellectual property security agreements), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Acquiror, providing for, concurrently with the repayment of
obligations giving rise thereto, the release of all Liens with respect to the
capital stock, property and assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to such Indebtedness. Substantially concurrently with the Closing,
and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including in this _Section 3.07_ ), (A) (1) Acquiror, Merger Sub,
Intermediate Holdings or New HoldCo shall make available to the Company, or
pay directly, an amount sufficient to pay all amounts owing with respect to
the First Lien Credit Agreement and the FILO Agreement outstanding on the
Closing Date immediately prior to the Closing, if any, (2) the Company, if
such amount is not paid directly by, and has been made available to the
Company by, Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings or New HoldCo, shall
apply the amounts made available to it to pay such amounts owing with respect
to the First Lien Credit Agreement and the FILO Agreement, and (3) the
Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to be fully and irrevocably released
upon the occurrence of the Closing from all Liens relating to the Repaid

8.02  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and the Surviving Company
agree that they shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company and Acquiror and each of their respective
Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company, Acquiror or
their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted
under applicable Law and its respective certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement
or other organizational documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the
foregoing, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to (i) maintain for a period of not less than six years from the
Effective Time provisions in its certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement and other
organizational documents concerning the indemnification and exoneration
(including provisions relating to expense advancement) of the
Surviving Company's and its Subsidiaries' former and current officers,
directors, employees, and agents that are no less favorable to those Persons
than the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, certificate of
formation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement and other
organizational documents of the Company, Acquiror or their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in each case, as of the date of this Agreement
and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any
respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder,
in each case, except as required by Law. Acquiror shall assume, and be liable
for, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to honor, each
of the covenants in this _Section 8.02_.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving Company to maintain in effect directors' and officers'
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
heretofore made available to Acquiror or its agents or representatives) on
terms not less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage,
except that in no event shall Acquiror be required to pay an annual premium
for such insurance in excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable
by the Company for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2018;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Acquiror or the Surviving Company may
cause coverage to be extended under the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy containing terms not
materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage
with respect to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within such six-year
period, any insurance required to be maintained under this  _Section 8.02_
shall be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition
thereof.

Surviving Company. In the event that Acquiror or the Surviving Company or any
of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Acquiror and the Surviving Company shall ensure that proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.02_.

  



  

(d) On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall enter into customary indemnification
agreements reasonably satisfactory to the NESCO Owner with the individuals
set forth on _Schedule 8.05(a)_ and _Schedule 8.05(b)_ , which indemnification
agreements shall continue to be effective following the Closing.

Letter (after giving effect to all related "market flex" terms) (" _Alternate
Debt Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event and the provisions of this _Section 8.12_ and _Sections 7.08_ , _12.03_
, _12.04_ , _12.06_ , _12.10_ and _12.13_  shall be applicable to the

adoption and approval of this Agreement, (v) the approval of the Mergers, (vi)

Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Acquiror shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Annual Meeting, provided that the Annual Meeting (x) is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 45 days after the date for which the
Annual Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or
postponements required by applicable Law) and (y) is held no later than three
Business Days prior to the Termination Date.

  



  

9.03  _Exclusivity_.

not take, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates or Representatives to
take, whether directly or indirectly any action to solicit, initiate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or
encourage, or provide information to, any Person (other than Acquiror, Merger
Sub, Intermediate Holdings, New HoldCo and/or any of their Affiliates)
concerning any purchase of any of the Company's equity securities or the
issuance and sale of any securities of, or membership interests in, the
Company or its Subsidiaries (other than any purchases of equity securities by
the Company from employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or any merger
or sale of substantial assets involving the Company or its Subsidiaries,
other than immaterial assets or assets sold in the ordinary course of
business (each such acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings
and New HoldCo hereby acknowledge that prior to the date of this Agreement,
the Company has provided information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and has afforded access to, and engaged in discussions with,
other Persons in connection with a proposed Acquisition Transaction and that
such information, access and discussions could reasonably enable another
Person to form a basis for a proposal to engage in an Acquisition Transaction
without any breach by the Company of this _Section 9.03(a)_ ; _provided_ ,
_further_ , however, that the foregoing acknowledgement shall not in any way
diminish the obligations of the Company, the NESCO Owner, and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives pursuant to this sentence and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not enter into any further discussions
or negotiations or provide any further information in respect of, or enter
into any agreement or arrangement with respect to, any such
proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may respond to any
unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction by indicating only
that the Company is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is unable to
provide any information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any negotiations or discussions
concerning an Acquisition Transaction for as long as that exclusivity
agreement remains in effect and, in such event, the Company shall notify
Acquiror of such facts and circumstances. Each of the Company and the NESCO
Owner shall, and each shall cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect
to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Acquisition
Transaction.

  



     

71

 



    



  

(b) During the Interim Period, none of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate
Holdings or New HoldCo shall take, nor shall they permit any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives to take, whether directly or
indirectly, any action to solicit, initiate, continue or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or
encourage, respond, provide information to or commence due diligence with
respect to, any Person (other than the Company, the NESCO Owner and/or any of
their Affiliates), concerning, relating to or which is intended or is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, any offer, inquiry,
proposal or indication of interest, written or oral relating to any Business
Combination (a " _Business Combination Proposal_ ") other than with the
Company, the NESCO Owner and their respective Affiliates and Representatives.
Each of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings and New HoldCo shall, and
each shall cause its respective Affiliates and Representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, a Business Combination
Proposal.

  



  

9.04  _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a)  _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company shall pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added or other similar Taxes incurred in connection with
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all
such Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Acquiror and the NESCO Owner
will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b)  _Reorganization Treatment_. Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings,
New HoldCo, the Company and NESCO Owner intend that (i) the Domestication
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F)
of the Code and (ii) the Mergers, taken together as a single integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of
Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings, New HoldCo, the Company and
NESCO Owner shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to so qualify and shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether in audits,
Tax Returns or otherwise) such treatment unless required to do so by
applicable Law or as required in good faith to settle a dispute with a
Governmental Authority. Each of the parties hereto agrees to promptly notify
all other parties hereto of any challenge to the Intended Tax Treatment by
any Governmental Authority.

  



     

72

 



    



  

(c) The Company, Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings and New HoldCo
hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning

(d) Acquiror shall reasonably cooperate with the holders of Acquiror Stock to
timely provide them with information sufficient to substantiate the "all
earnings and profits amount" (as such term is used in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.367(b)-3) with respect to their Acquiror Stock and to make any
filings contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(b)-1(c) (including,
if applicable, the statement contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(b)-1(c)(5)) with respect to the Domestication.

  



  

(e) Acquiror shall make or cause to be made a timely election to treat Merger
Sub as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which election
will be effective prior to the First Effective Time.

  



  

9.05  _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

  



  

(a) Acquiror acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. At the Effective
Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) None of Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall
make any public announcement or issue any public communication regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any matter related to
the foregoing, without first obtaining the prior consent of the Company or
Acquiror, as applicable (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except if such announcement or other communication
is required by applicable Law or legal process (including pursuant to the
Securities Law or the rules of any national securities exchange), in which
case Acquiror or the Company, as applicable, shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to coordinate such announcement or communication with the
other party, prior to announcement or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, each party hereto and its Affiliates may make non-public
announcements regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to their and their Affiliates' respective directors,
officers, employees, direct and indirect limited partners and investors
without the consent of the other party hereto; and _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that subject to _Section 7.02_ and this _Section 9.05_ , the foregoing shall
not prohibit any party hereto from communicating with third parties to the
extent necessary for the purpose of seeking any third party consent.

  



  

9.06  _Post-Closing Cooperation; Further Assurances_. Each party hereto
shall, on the request of any other party hereto, execute such further
documents, and perform such further acts, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to give full effect to the allocation of rights, benefits,
obligations and liabilities contemplated by this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

3.06, Section 8.01(e)_ and _Section 11.02_ ), each party hereto shall bear

12.07  _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This

same instrument.

  



  

12.08  _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits referenced herein
are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references
herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of
this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure

Exhibits to this Agreement), the Sponsor Agreement and that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 2, 2019, by and between Energy
Capital Partners III, LLC and Acquiror (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
constitute the entire agreement among the parties relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any other agreements, whether
written or oral, that may have been made or entered into by or among any of

transactions contemplated hereby. No representations, warranties, covenants,
understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement exist between the parties hereto except as

12.10  _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in
part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed in the same
manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement. The
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any of the parties hereto
shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors or manager, as
applicable, of any of the parties hereto to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 11.01_ or to cause such party to enter into an
amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 12.10_. Notwithstanding

relevant) may not be modified or amended in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written
consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

  



  

12.11  _Publicity_. All press releases or other public communications of any
nature whatsoever relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the method of the release for publication thereof, shall prior
to the Closing be subject to the prior mutual approval of Acquiror and the
Company which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by any such party.

  



  

12.12  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereto
further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held
invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this
Agreement, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be reformed,
construed and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Law and to the
extent necessary to give effect to the intent of the parties hereto.

  



     

81

 



    



  

12.13  _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection it
may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience
of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and
determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any other court (except in respect of the Debt Financing or against any
Debt Financing Source as set forth below). Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any manner
permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against
any other party hereto in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section 12.13_.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING). NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING SET FORTH ABOVE, NO PARTY HERETO, NOR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, SHALL BRING OR SUPPORT THE BRINGING OF, ANY CLAIM,
WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE,
AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY
WAY TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF ANYWHERE OTHER
THAN IN (I) ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK OR
(II) THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

  



  

12.14  _Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (a) each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 11.01_ , this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the parties
hereto would have entered into this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at
Law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any party hereto seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such injunction.

  



     

82

 



    



  

12.15  _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except to the extent a party hereto (and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations undertaken by such party hereto), (i) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any party hereto and (ii) no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more
of the Company, the NESCO Owner, Acquiror, Merger Sub, Intermediate Holdings
or New HoldCo under this Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company agrees on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates and Representatives that none of the Debt
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated herein (including the Debt Financing). This
_Section 12.15_ is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt
Financing Sources and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Company.

  



  

12.16  _Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements
in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and other
provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no liability after the
Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and agreements
contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in part
after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring after
the Closing and (b) this  _Article XII_.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other representations and
warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including (x) regarding
the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to state or to disclose, any
information, including in the estimates, projections or forecasts or any other
information, document or material provided to or made available to any party
hereto or their respective Affiliates or Representatives in certain
"data rooms," management presentations or in any other form in expectation of
the Transactions, including meetings, calls or correspondence with management
of any party hereto (or any party's Subsidiaries), and (y) any relating to the
future or historical business, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any party hereto (or its
Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any party's or its
Subsidiaries' assets) are specifically disclaimed by all parties hereto and
their respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including the
Representatives and Affiliates of any party hereto or its Subsidiaries); and
(vi) each party hereto and its respective Affiliates are not relying on any
representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except the
Company Representations by the Company, the NESCO Owner Representations by
the NESCO Owner and the Acquiror Representations by Acquiror, Merger Sub,
Intermediate Holdings and New HoldCo.

      



  

(b) Effective upon Closing, each party hereto waives, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its respective Affiliates and Representatives, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Claims and causes
of action it may have against any other party hereto or their respective
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former Affiliates or
Representatives relating to the operation of any party hereto or its
Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, the Schedules, or the Exhibits to this Agreement,
whether arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign
statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. Each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that it will not assert, institute or maintain any
Action, suit, Claim, investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever,
including a counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or
equitable theory under which such liability or obligation may be sought to be
imposed, that makes any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set
forth in this _Section 12.17_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 12.17(b)_ shall preclude any party hereto
from seeking any remedy for actual and intentional fraud by a party hereto
solely and exclusively with respect to the making of any representation
or warranty by it in _Article IV_ , _Article V_ or _Article VI_ (as
applicable). Each party hereto shall have the right to enforce this _Section
12.17_ on behalf of any Person that would be benefitted or protected by this
_Section 12.17_  if they were a party hereto. The foregoing agreements,
acknowledgements, disclaimers and waivers are irrevocable. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 12.17_ shall limit, modify,
restrict or operate as a waiver with respect to, any rights any party hereto
may have under any written agreement entered into in connection with the
transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Stockholders' Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Sponsor
Agreement.
