AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 11, 2009 (this
"Agreement"), among Churchill Downs Incorporated, a Kentucky corporation
("Parent"), Tomahawk Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Tomahawk Merger LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger LLC"),
and Youbet.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

 

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, whereby each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"),
together with the associated Company Rights (as hereinafter defined) issued
under the Company Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined), not owned
directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, will be converted into the
right to receive (i) shares of Common Stock, no par value, of Parent ("Parent
Common Stock") and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration (as hereinafter
defined);

 

 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is in furtherance of and consistent with their
respective long-term business strategies and is in the best interest of their
respective shareholders or stockholders, as applicable;

 

 

WHEREAS, immediately following the Merger, Parent will cause the surviving
corporation in the Merger to merge with and into Merger LLC in accordance
with Section 1.16, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
(the "LLC Act");

 

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to Parent's and Merger Sub's willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent is entering into a voting agreement with
the members of the Board of Directors of the Company and certain stockholders
of the Company, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (each,
a "Voting Agreement"); and

 

 

WHEREAS, this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
with respect to the Merger and the Subsequent Merger (as hereinafter defined)
for United States federal income tax purposes pursuant to which the Merger
and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, are to be treated as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(the "Code").

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-1-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ARTICLE I 

 

 

THE MERGER AND SUBSEQUENT MERGER

 

 

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined). Following the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation")
and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub
in accordance with the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
at the election of Parent, any direct wholly owned Subsidiary (as hereinafter
defined) of Parent may be substituted for Merger Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger; provided that such substituted corporation is a
Delaware corporation which is formed solely for the purpose of engaging in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other
business activities and has assumed all obligations of Merger Sub under this
Agreement. In such event, the parties agree to execute an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent and the Company, in order to reflect such substitution.

 

 

Section 1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective when a
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware; provided, however, that, upon the mutual
consent of Merger Sub and the Company, the Certificate of Merger may provide
for a later date of effectiveness of the Merger not more than thirty (30)
days after the date the Certificate of Merger is filed. The filing of the
Certificate of Merger shall be made on the date of the Closing
(as hereinafter defined).

 

 

Section 1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in Section 259 of the DGCL.

 

 

Section 1.4 Charter and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable foreign, federal,
state, local or municipal laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations and rules
of any Governmental Entity, including all Orders ("Laws"); provided that
Article FIRST of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation (which is
hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation") is Youbet.com, Inc." At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or in the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) The directors and officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 1.5 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any securities of Merger Sub and the Company:

 

 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Merger Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Shares"), together with the
associated Company Rights, that are held in the treasury of the Company or by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any Company Shares, together
with the associated Company Rights, owned by Parent or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and no capital stock of Parent or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) Subject to the provisions of Sections 1.8 and 1.10 and, if applicable,
Section 1.5(d), each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (together with the associated Company Rights), other
than Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined) and shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 1.5(b), shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) 0.0598 (such number being the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock ("Parent Shares")
(including the associated Parent Rights (as hereinafter defined)) (the
"Per Share Stock Consideration") and (ii) $0.97 in cash without interest
(the "Per Share Cash Consideration" and, together with the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). All references in this
Agreement to Parent Common Stock and Parent Shares shall be deemed to include
the associated Parent Rights unless the context requires otherwise. All such
Company Shares and the associated Company Rights, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive any dividends
and other distributions in accordance with Section 1.7, certificates
representing the Parent Shares into which such shares are converted, the Per
Share Cash Consideration and any cash, without interest, in lieu of
fractional shares to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 1.6.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that the aggregate number of Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section
1.5(c) (the "Total Stock Amount") would be greater than 19.6% of the Parent
Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
amount, the "Stock Threshold"), (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration shall
be decreased to reduce the Total Stock Amount to the Stock Threshold and (ii)
the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the
product of (x) the amount of such reduction in the Per Share Stock
Consideration pursuant to the preceding sentence multiplied by (y) $30.71.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-3-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with the associated Company Rights, which are held of record by
stockholders who shall not have approved the Merger and who shall have
demanded properly in writing appraisal of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as set forth in Section
1.5(c), but the holders thereof instead shall be entitled to, and the
Dissenting Shares shall only represent the right to receive, payment of the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if such a holder fails to demand
properly in writing from the Surviving Corporation the appraisal of his or
its shares in accordance with Section 262(d) of the DGCL or, after making
such demand, subsequently delivers an effective written withdrawal of such
demand, or fails to establish his or its entitlement to appraisal rights as
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, if so required, or (ii) if a court shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to receive payment for his or its
shares or such holder shall otherwise lose his or its appraisal rights, then,
in any such case, each Company Share, together with the associated Company
Rights, held of record by such holder or holders shall automatically
be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 1.5(c), upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such Dissenting Shares. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of such shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for fair value for Dissenting Shares or offer to
settle, settle or negotiate in respect of any such demands.

 

 

Section 1.6 Exchange of Shares. Parent shall authorize a nationally
recognized financial institution selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent").
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent for exchange with outstanding Company Shares, together with
the associated Company Rights, all cash and certificates representing the
Parent Shares (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by
Parent if uncertificated Parent Shares will be issued) payable or issuable
pursuant to Section 1.5(c) and cash, as required to make payments in lieu of
any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.8 (such cash and Parent Shares,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent may only
invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided,
however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Parent and any risk of loss shall be borne by Parent. The Exchange Agent
shall deliver the Per Share Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued and paid pursuant to Section 1.5(c) out of the Exchange Fund. Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, to mail to each record holder of Company Shares, which at
the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(c), a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Shares shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Company Shares to
the Exchange Agent), and shall contain instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Company Shares in exchange for the Per Share Cash
Consideration and certificates representing Parent Shares (or
appropriate alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if
uncertificated Parent Shares will be issued), and cash in lieu of fractional
shares (the "Transmittal Letter"). Upon surrender for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent of Company Shares, together with the Transmittal Letter, duly
executed, the holder of such Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Per Share Cash Consideration and that number of whole
Parent Shares (after taking into account all shares surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(c)
(which shall be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested), cash in lieu of any fractional share in accordance
with Section 1.8 and certain dividends and other distributions in accordance
with Section 1.7, and any Company Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Subject to Section 1.5(e), until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 1.6, each Company Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Sections 1.7 and 1.8)
upon such surrender.

Section 1.7 Dividends; Transfer Taxes; Withholding. No dividends or other
distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent
Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof on or after the
Effective Time, will be paid to any Person entitled by reason of the Merger
to receive Parent Shares until such Person surrenders the related Company
Shares, as provided in Section 1.6, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares will be paid to any such Person pursuant to Section 1.8 until such
Person shall so surrender the related Company Shares. Subject to the effect
of applicable Law, there shall be paid to each record holder of a new Parent
Share: (i) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable
thereafter, the amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore
paid with respect to the Parent Shares and having a record date on or after
the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender; (ii) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount
of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent
Shares and having a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date on or subsequent to such surrender; and
(iii) at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter,
the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional Parent Share to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.8. In no event shall the
Person entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions or cash in
lieu of fractional shares be entitled to receive interest on such dividends
or other distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares. If any portion
of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be paid to or issued in a name
other than that in which the Company Shares surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Company Shares be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in
the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Shares
or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable or otherwise applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as Parent or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local
or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person who otherwise would have
received the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

Section 1.8 No Fractional Securities. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Company Shares pursuant to this Article I or upon the cancellation of
Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 5.5; no Parent dividend or other
distribution or stock split shall relate to any fractional share; and no
fractional share shall entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a securityholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share,
each holder of Company Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a Parent Share upon surrender of Company Shares for exchange
pursuant to this Article I or upon cancellation of Company Stock Options
pursuant to Section 5.5 will be paid an amount in cash (without interest),
rounded down to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share
value calculated as the average of the closing sale prices of one Parent
Share for the five (5) most recent days that the Parent Common Stock has
traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") ending on the last full
trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the fractional
interest of a Parent Share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
The parties acknowledge that payment of cash in lieu of fractional Parent
Shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to
Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional
share interests, without interest, subject to and in accordance with the
terms of Section 1.7 and this Section 1.8.

 

 

Section 1.9 Return of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent,
and any such former stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this
Article I shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Parent Common Stock, Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares and any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock
for any such Parent Shares, Per Share Cash Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares and dividends and distributions which are delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any certificate representing any Company Shares shall
not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Parent Shares or
any dividends or other distributions payable to the holder of such
certificate representing any Company Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Parent Shares,
dividends or other distributions in respect of such certificate representing
any Company Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

Company Common Stock) with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock or any change or conversion of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock into other securities (or if a record date with respect to any of the
foregoing should occur) prior to the Effective Time, appropriate and
proportionate adjustments, if any, shall be made to the Per Share Merger
Consideration, Exchange Ratio, Per Share Stock Consideration and, to the
extent required by Section 1.5(d), Per Share Cash Consideration and all

been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Shares, together with the associated Company Rights.

presented to the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or Parent, such

required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such certificate, the
Exchange Agent or Parent will issue and pay or cause to be issued and paid in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate representing any
Company Share(s) the Parent Shares, Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional Parent Shares to which the holder thereof is entitled

or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than any specific factual
information contained therein) or in the letter delivered by Parent to the

(b) Each outstanding share of capital stock (or other voting security or
equity equivalent, as the case may be) of each Significant Subsidiary of
Parent is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and,
except for director or qualifying shares, each such share (or other voting

Section 2.5 SEC Documents and Other Reports; Internal Controls and
Procedures.

 

 

(a) Parent has timely filed with the SEC all documents required to be filed
by it since January 1, 2007 under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (the
"Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing dates, or,
if amended, as of the date of the last amendment prior to the date of
this Agreement, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and, at the respective times they were filed, none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any notes thereto) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting

process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Parent does not
have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent's
internal control over financial reporting.

Section 3.14 Certain Agreements.

 

 

(a) Except as filed as exhibits to the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to or bound by (i) any Contract which is a "material contract" (as
such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act); (ii) any Contract which materially limits or restricts the manner or
localities in which the Company or any of its Affiliates (including Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Merger) may conduct business or which
contains most favored nation pricing or exclusivity or non-solicitation
provisions with respect to customers or suppliers; (iii) any Contract which
requires any payment by the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of $100,000
in any year and which is not terminable within one year without penalty, or
which requires any payment to the Company or its Subsidiaries in excess of
$100,000 in any year and which is not terminable within one year without
penalty; (iv) any Contract relating to or guaranteeing indebtedness for
borrowed money to the extent the aggregate principal amount outstanding

Company to any third party (other than to consultants or contractors of the

product or technology that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; (ix) any material Contract, other than end-user licenses,
sale Contracts and related maintenance and support Contracts and
other licenses or agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business,
to license any third party to use, manufacture or reproduce any Company
product, service or Intellectual Property Right or any material Contract to

-24-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) All of the Company Contracts are valid and in full force and effect
(except those which are cancelled, rescinded or terminated after the date of
this Agreement in accordance with their terms), except where the failure to
be in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person
is challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Contract, except
such challenges which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the other
parties thereto, is in breach of any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act which (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would

aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) Section 3.14(c) of the Company Letter sets forth the total amount of

Section 3.15 ERISA.

 

 

(a) Each material Company Plan is listed in Section 3.15(a) of the
Company Letter. With respect to each such material Company Plan, to
the extent applicable, the Company has delivered to Parent a true and correct
copy of (i) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Forms 5500) filed with
the IRS; (ii) each such Company Plan that has been reduced to writing and all
amendments thereto; (iii) each trust, insurance and administrative Contract
relating to each such Company Plan; (iv) a written summary of each unwritten
Company Plan; (v) the most recent summary plan description or other written
explanation of each Company Plan provided to participants; (vi) the most
recent determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to any
Company Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; (vii)
any request for a determination currently pending before the IRS; and (viii)
all correspondence with the IRS, the Department of Labor, the SEC or Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any outstanding inquiry, controversy
or audit that would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability.
Each Company Plan complies in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and
all other applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations, and the
plan sponsor of each Company Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with all filing and disclosure requirements imposed on it with respect to
such Company Plans. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors,
contributes to, or has any liability with respect to (x) a plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA, including any defined benefit plan (as defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA), a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA),
or a multiple employer plan subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, (y) a
multiple employer welfare benefit arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40)(A)
of ERISA) or (z) a plan subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-25-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any material liability of
any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown, direct, indirect, contingent
or otherwise, (i) on account of any violation of the health care requirements
of Part 6 or 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B or 4980D of
the Code, (ii) under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, (iii) under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (iv)
under Title IV of ERISA. No fiduciary (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of
ERISA) of any Company Plan subject to Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA has committed a breach of fiduciary duty with respect to that Company
Plan that could subject such fiduciary, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company to any material liability. There is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened action, claim or lawsuit
relating to any Company Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) that
could result in a material liability. There is no audit, inquiry or
examination pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened by the
IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any
other governmental body with respect to any Company Plan. All Company Plans
that are intended by their terms to be, or are otherwise treated by the
Company as, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS (or a timely
application for such determination or opinion is now pending), and no loss of
such qualification nor material penalty under the IRS Closing Agreement
Program is reasonably expected to result if an IRS audit or investigation
were to occur. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liability or obligation under any Company Plan to provide health or life
insurance benefits after termination of employment to any person other than
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state law.

 

 

(c) Except to the extent set forth in Section 5.5, neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with another event) will or is
reasonably expected to (i) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of a Company to any payment (including severance pay
or similar compensation), any cancellation of indebtedness, or any increase
in compensation, (ii) result in the acceleration of payment, funding
or vesting under any material Company Plan or (iii) result in any increase
in benefits payable under any material Company Plan. No amount paid
or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
section 280G of the Code, or would constitute an "excess parachute payment"
if such amounts were subject to the provisions of section 280G of the Code.

 

 

(d) Each Company Plan which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
within the meaning of, and subject to, Section 409A of the Code has been at
all times administered, operated and maintained in all respects in accordance
with its terms and according to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code,
except for any failure that would not result in a material liability to
the Company. No person is entitled to receive any tax "gross up"
payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
imposition of a Tax under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

 

(e) With respect to each Company Plan not subject to United States law (a
"Company Foreign Benefit Plan"), except for any failure that would not impose
a material liability on the Company, (i) the fair market value of the assets
of each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer
for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the reserve
shown on the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents for any unfunded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
projected benefit obligations, as of the Effective Time, with respect to all
current and former participants in such plan based on reasonable, country
specific actuarial assumptions and valuations and no transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book
reserve to be less than such projected benefit obligations and (ii) each
Company Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered
and has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate regulatory
authorities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-26-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Except for any occurrence that would not impose a material liability on
the Company, the Company, with respect to employees outside of the United
States, (i) is not under any legal liability to pay pensions, gratuities,
superannuation allowances or the like to any past or present directors,
officers, employees or dependents of employees; (ii) has not made ex-gratia
or voluntary payments by way of superannuation allowance or pension; and/or
(iii) does not maintain and has not contemplated any pension schemes or
arrangements for payment of the pensions or death benefits or similar
arrangements.

the protection and clean-up of the environment and activities or
conditions related thereto, including those relating to the generation,
handling, disposal, transportation or release of hazardous materials

are no events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents,
actions or plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may interfere
with or prevent compliance or continued compliance with applicable Worker
Safety Laws and Environmental Laws, other than any such interference or
prevention as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 3.17 Labor Matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any collective bargaining Contract or any labor Contract.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair
labor practice or violation of state or local labor, wage and hour, or
employment laws with respect to any Persons employed by or
otherwise performing services primarily for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Company Business Personnel"), and there is no unfair
labor practice complaint or grievance or other administrative or judicial
complaint, action or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
by the National Labor Relations Board, the California Labor Commissioner, any
comparable state or federal agency, or any other third party with respect to
the Company Business Personnel, except where such unfair labor practice,
complaint, grievance or other administrative or judicial complaint, action or
investigation would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown or
stoppage pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which may interfere with the
respective business activities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

or any of their Representatives in connection with such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry.

 

 

(d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or
modify (in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to

adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

arrangement or understanding or any tender offer (A) constituting, or
relating to, any Alternative Proposal or (B) requiring it (or that would

other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 4.3(d) or in any other provision of

to a Superior Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.3, terminate this Agreement

prior written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received
a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the per share value of the consideration offered
therein and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the
Superior Proposal), and shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the Person or group of Persons making such
Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "Alternative
Transaction Agreement") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new three (3) Business Day period) and (3)
that it intends to terminate this Agreement, and the manner in which
it intends to do so, and (B) prior to terminating this Agreement, to
the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the transaction
contemplated by the Alternative Transaction Agreement ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-39-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with this
Section 4.3; and

 

 

(v) the Company pays all fees and expenses as required pursuant to Section

this Agreement, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the

circumstances involving or relating to a Superior Proposal but only in
response to an Intervening Event and provided that the Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with this Section 4.3,
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the directors'
fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law;
provided, however, that neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall take any of the actions set forth in this Section
4.3(e) unless the Company has first complied with the provisions of Section
4.3(d)(iii), treating the occurrence of such Intervening Event as if a
Superior Proposal had been received and after so complying, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would constitute a breach of the
directors' fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.3(a), prior to the
Company Stockholder Meeting, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or publicly disclosing the existence
of a Alternative Proposal to the extent the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 

Section 4.4 Third Party Standstill Agreements. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall not
terminate, materially amend or modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to a Alternative Proposal or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other
than any involving Parent). During such period, the Company agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the provisions of any such agreements, including
obtaining injunctions to prevent any material breaches of such agreements and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the
United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take, or be prohibited from
taking, any action otherwise prohibited by this Section 4.4, if, in the good
faith judgment of the Company's Board of Directors, after consultation with
outside counsel of the Company, such action or inaction, as the case may be,
would violate the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors to the
Company's stockholders.

Section 4.5 Reorganization. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, unless the other party shall otherwise
agree in writing, none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall take or fail to take any action which action or failure

be, jeopardize the qualification of the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 

Section 5.1 Preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the
Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to file the
Registration Statement until such time as the Company has taken such action
as is necessary to resolve in all material respects the matters set forth in
the comment letter dated October 13, 2009 addressed to the Company from the
SEC with respect to the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2008 and Form 8-K furnished August 13, 2009 and any subsequent letters from
the SEC addressed to the Company relating to the subject matter thereof
(collectively, the "Company Comment Letter"), including the filing of any
amendments to the Company's current and periodic reports with the SEC as
reasonably requested by Parent; provided, further, that notwithstanding the
preceding proviso, Parent shall file the Registration Statement not later
than 60 days after the date hereof so long as the Company has used its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such matters set forth in the Company
Comment Letter, subject to applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Each
of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of
the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement, including the use by each of
Parent and the Company of reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the other a "comfort letter" of its independent auditors, dated the date two
(2) Business Days prior to the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement to
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and state
securities Laws, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and
Parent shall provide the other with the opportunity to review and comment on
such documents prior to their filing with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment
or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the other's prior
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
and without providing the other the opportunity to review and comment
thereon; provided that the prior written consent of Parent shall not be
required in connection with any filings made by the Company in connection
with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Parent or the Company, as
applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives oral or written
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC or any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC, after the other party has had a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the respective stockholders of
the Company. As promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement shall have become effective, the Company shall distribute the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders.

Section 5.2 Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

 

(a) The Company will, as soon as practicable following the date on which
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of stockholders (the
"Company Stockholder Meeting") for the purpose of the Company's stockholders
duly approving and adopting this Agreement (the "Company
Stockholder Approval").

 

 

(b) The Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its
stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement, shall use reasonable
best efforts to solicit such approvals and adoption by its stockholders and
such Board of Directors or committee thereof shall not withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent such recommendation or
its declaration that this Agreement and the Merger are advisable and fair to
and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders or resolve or
propose to do any of the foregoing, except if the Company has complied with
Section 4.3. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 4.3(e), Parent shall have the option, exercisable
within five (5) Business Days after such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to submit this
Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of approving and
adopting this Agreement. If Parent exercises such option, Parent shall not
be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(i)
and shall not be entitled to the Termination Fee or reimbursement of the
Termination Expenses under Section 7.3(a)(i) in respect thereof.

Section 5.3 Access to Information. Subject to contractual and legal
restrictions applicable to Parent or to the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable notice,
afford to the Representatives of the other reasonable access to, and permit
them to make such inspections as they may reasonably require of, during
normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Effective Time, all of its employees, customers, properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records (including the work papers of
independent accountants, if available and subject to the consent of such
independent accountants), and, during such period, each of Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to the other (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other
may reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3
shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall be
required to afford such access if it would (i) unreasonably disrupt
the operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) cause a
violation of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party (provided that Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall use
reasonable best efforts to implement procedures to provide the access or
information contemplated by this Section 5.3 without violating such
agreement), or (iii) cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such party or any
of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law.
All information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated September 16, 2009, between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

 

 

Section 5.4 Current Nasdaq Listing. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to continue the listing of the Parent Common
Stock and the Company Common Stock, respectively, on Nasdaq during the term
of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.5 Company Stock Options. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, if unvested, vest and become exercisable in full. Prior
to and effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate the Company Stock Option Plan. Holders of
all unexercised Company Stock Options outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time will receive, in cancellation of their Company Stock
Options, the following: (a) a single lump sum cash payment from the Company
at the Effective Time (or, to the extent the Company does not have sufficient
cash available to make such payment at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Company to make such payment
immediately following the Effective Time), in an amount equal to the product
of (i) the number of Company Shares provided for in such Company Stock Option
and (ii) the Pro-Rata Cash Portion, which cash payment shall be treated as
compensation and shall be net of any applicable United States federal or
state withholding Tax; and (b) a number of Parent Shares in an amount equal
to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares provided for in such
Company Stock Option and (ii) the Pro-Rata Stock Portion, which share
issuance shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable
United States federal or state withholding Tax; provided, however, that if
the exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to
or greater than the Closing Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be canceled without any cash payment or issuance of Parent Shares being
made in respect thereof.

Section 5.6 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, except with respect to filings under the HSR Act and
matters involving Antitrust Laws (which shall be governed by Section 5.7),
each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices,
petitions, statements, submissions of information, applications and other
documents, and to obtain all Permits which are material to the Company and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section 5.7 HSR Approval.

 

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement or any shorter period as
required by applicable Law), each of Parent and the Company shall file any
Notification and Report Forms and related material required to be filed by it
with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall promptly make any
further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or advisable
(the "HSR Filings").

 

 

(b) Upon and subject to the terms of this Section 5.7, Parent and the
Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to (i) use their
best efforts to obtain prompt termination of any waiting period under the HSR
Act; (ii) cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making
of all HSR Filings and any other material actions pursuant to this Section
5.7, including subject to applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other
party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any Antitrust
Authority and by providing counsel for the other party with copies of all
filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence between
such party (and its advisors) with any Antitrust Authority and any other
information supplied by such party and such party's Subsidiaries to an
Antitrust Authority or received from an Antitrust Authority in connection
with such HSR Filings or any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that materials may be redacted before being provided to the other party (A)
to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company, or any
of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns; (iii) furnish to the other parties such information
and assistance as such parties reasonably may request in connection with the
preparation of any submissions to, or agency proceedings by, any Antitrust
Authority; and (iv) promptly inform the other party of any communications
with, and inquiries or requests for information from, such Antitrust
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 5.7(a) and this Section 5.7(b), each party agrees to
cooperate and use its best efforts to assist in any defense by any other
party hereto of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement before any
Antitrust Authority reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including by providing (as promptly as practicable) such
information as may be requested by such Antitrust Authority or such
assistance as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto in
such defense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-44-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If any objections are asserted by any Antitrust Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, or if any Action is instituted by
any Governmental Entity challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of any applicable Antitrust Law or an Order is issued
enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case under
any applicable Antitrust Law, Parent shall, subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.7, use its best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge
as such Antitrust Authority may have to such transactions under such Law or
to have such Order vacated, reversed or otherwise removed in accordance with
applicable legal procedures with the goal of enabling the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by the Outside Date (as
hereinafter defined), and the Company shall use its best efforts to assist
Parent in effectuating the foregoing; provided, however, that (i)
the Company shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the prior
written consent of Parent, and (ii) Parent shall not take any of the
foregoing actions without the prior written consent of the Company if such
actions would bind the Company to take any action (including paying money or
entering into any other obligation) irrespective of whether the Closing
occurs. Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall,
subject to the provisions of this Section 5.7, use their respective best
efforts to seek to lift, reverse or remove any temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order or decree that would
otherwise give rise to a failure of any Antitrust Conditions.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall not be obligated to agree (and failure to so agree shall not
constitute a failure by Parent to satisfy its "best efforts" obligations as
provided in this Section 5.7), and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
shall agree without Parent's prior written consent, to take any action or
accept any condition, restriction, obligation or requirement with respect to
Parent, the Company, their respective Subsidiaries or their and their
respective Subsidiaries' assets if such action, condition, restriction,
obligation or requirement (i) would reasonably be expected to require Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to sell, license, transfer,
assign, lease, dispose of or hold separate any material business or assets,
(ii) would reasonably be expected to result in any material limitations on
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to own, retain, conduct
or operate all or a material portion of their respective businesses or assets
or (iii) would reasonably be expected to require Parent, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries to grant any material right or commercial or other
accommodation to, or enter into any material commercial contractual or other
commercial relationship with, any third party.

 

 

(e) Parent will, after reasonable consultation with the Company as to
strategy, lead all proceedings and coordinate all activities with respect to
seeking any actions, consents, approvals or waivers of any Antitrust
Authority as contemplated hereby, and the Company and its Subsidiaries will
take such actions as reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding Parent's
rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the prior sentence, Parent
shall not require the Company to, and the Company shall not be required to,
take any action with respect to satisfying the Antitrust Conditions which
would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the
Closing occurs. Without in any way limiting its rights or obligations
hereunder (including under Section 5.7(d) and this Section 5.7(e)), Parent
and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that it is the intent of the
parties to cause the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to occur as soon as reasonably practicable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-45-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.8 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will not issue any
press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or otherwise issue any written public statements with respect to such
transactions without prior consultation with the other party, except as may
be required by applicable Law, by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with Nasdaq or with respect to any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

 

Section 5.9 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "business combination"
or "control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation
shall become, or purport to become, applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of
Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

Section 5.10 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

 

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and until such
later date as of which any Action commenced during such six (6) year period
shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and from and after the Subsequent
Merger, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations (including both indemnification and advancement
of expenses) of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the certificate of
incorporation or any bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
indemnification agreements, in each case, in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time for the benefit of any of its current or former directors and
officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time (and until such later date as of which any
Action commenced during such six (6) year period shall have been finally
disposed of), Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate
of incorporation, certificate of formation and bylaws and operating
agreement, as applicable (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and their respective
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable, in
the aggregate, as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6)
year period (and until such later date as of which any Action commenced
during such six (6) year period shall have been finally disposed of), such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any respect, except as required by Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-46-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (and from
and after the Subsequent Merger, the Surviving Company) to provide, for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, the
Company's current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the "DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable to the Company's
existing policy or, if no such insurance coverage is available, the best
available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (and from and after the Subsequent Merger, the Surviving Company)
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Company's Current Premium"). If such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed 300% of the Company's Current Premium,
then Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide
the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the
Company's Current Premium. The Company's Current Premium is set forth on the
Company Letter.

 

 

(c) Successors. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company
or any of their respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with,
or merge with or into, any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person,
then, in each case, Parent shall take such action as may be necessary so that
such Person shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this
Section 5.10.

 

 

Section 5.11 Notification of Certain Matters. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Parent, of (i)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to
cause (x) any representation or warranty of the notifying party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at the Effective Time such that the
applicable condition to closing set forth in Article VI would, or would
reasonably be expected to, fail to be satisfied or (y) any covenant,
condition or agreement of the notifying party contained in this Agreement not
to be complied with or satisfied such that the applicable condition to
closing set forth in Article VI would, or would reasonably be expected to,
fail to be satisfied, (ii) any failure of the notifying party to comply in a
timely manner with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or (iii) any change, event or
effect which would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
the case may be, on the notifying party; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

 

Section 5.12 Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements.

 

 

(a) Parent agrees that it will cause the Surviving Company from and after the
Effective Time to honor all Company Plans, including all Employee Agreements;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
limiting the power of Parent or the Surviving Company to amend or terminate
any Company Plan or any other individual employee benefit plan, program,
Contract or policy in accordance with its terms or as requiring Parent or the
Surviving Company to offer to continue (other than as required by its terms)
any written employment contract.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-47-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Parent shall cause each Parent Plan covering employees of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to recognize prior service of such employees with the
Company and its Subsidiaries as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries (i)
for purposes of any waiting period, eligibility requirements, vesting, and
determination of benefits under any Parent Plan that is not a "pension plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and (ii) for purposes of eligibility
(including eligibility for early retirement benefits) and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under any Parent Plan that is a "pension plan" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

 

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions providing
that no additional contributions will be made to the Youbet.com, Inc. 401(k)
Retirement Savings Plan or the United Tote Company, Inc. 401(k) Plan on and
after the Closing and that such plans will be terminated effective as of the
Business Day immediately prior to the Closing (but contingent on the
Closing).

 

 

Section 5.13 Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

 

 

(a) Parent, the Company, Merger LLC and Merger Sub intend that, if the
Continuity Requirement is satisfied, the Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent
and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of the Code) in which
the Company is to be treated as merging directly with and into Parent, with
the Company Common Stock, together with the associated Company Rights,
converted in such merger into the right to receive the consideration provided
for hereunder, and each shall file all Tax Returns consistent with, and take
no position inconsistent with, such treatment unless the Continuity
Requirement is not satisfied or unless required to do so by applicable Law.
The parties to this Agreement agree to make such reasonable representations
as requested by counsel for the purpose of rendering the opinions described
in Section 6.2(c) and Section 6.3(c), including representations in the
Company Tax Certificate (in the case of the Company) and in the Parent Tax
Certificate (in the case of Parent).

 

 

(b) Parent, the Company, Merger LLC and Merger Sub hereby adopt this
Agreement as a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the Regulations.

 

 

(c) None of Parent, the Company, Merger LLC or Merger Sub shall, nor shall
they permit their Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and the
Surviving Company after the Effective Time) to, take any action before or, if
the Continuity Requirement is satisfied, after the Effective Time, which
would prevent the Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-48-  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Prior to Closing, the Company shall not take, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to take, any action that would adversely impact the ability
of counsel to provide the opinions pursuant to Section 6.2(c) and Section
6.3(c) or the ability of the Company to deliver the Company Tax Certificate.

 

 

Section 5.14 Nasdaq. Parent shall cause the Parent Shares to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving

fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)

by such courts. Parent and the Company hereby consent to service being made
