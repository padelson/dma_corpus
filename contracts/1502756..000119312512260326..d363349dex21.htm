1 _AGREEMENTS_

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

DEFINED TERMS

1.1 Definitions. Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit
A_ attached hereto.

ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

 

2.1 Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the terms of, and
subject to the conditions set forth in, this Agreement and the VSCA. Following
the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ")
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease.

 

2.2 Effective Time. As a part of the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall cause Articles of Merger meeting the requirements of Section
13.1-720 of the VSCA (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be properly executed
and filed with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of
Virginia in accordance with the terms and conditions of the VSCA. The Merger
shall become effective upon the issuance of a certificate of merger by the
State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia in accordance
with the VSCA (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

2.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.4 Articles of Incorporation. The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation will be amended in their entirety to be the same as the Articles
of Incorporation of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately before the
Effective Time (except that the name of Surviving Corporation will be changed
to the name of the Company at the Effective Time), until later amended in
accordance with the VSCA.

 



2 2.5 Bylaws. The bylaws of Surviving Corporation will be amended and
restated in their entirety to be the same as the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, until later amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof, Surviving Corporations Articles of
Incorporation, and the VSCA.

2.6 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time.

2.7 Conversion of Outstanding Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any party:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Subsidiary
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that,
after the Effective Time, Parent shall be the holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporations common stock. 

(b) Each Outstanding Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time: (i) shall be converted into the right to receive the
consideration described in _Section 2.9_ below, and (ii) shall otherwise
cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist;
provided, however, that Dissenting Shares shall not be so converted or
represent the right to receive the foregoing consideration, but the holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such rights as are set forth
in _Section 2.11_.

 

(c) Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any
of the Companys Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

2.8 Treatment of Options. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall give notice
in writing to each holder of an Option (each an " _Optionholder_ " and
collectively, the " _Optionholders_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each an " _Outstanding Option_ " and collectively, the "
_Outstanding Options_ ") that (a) all Outstanding Options shall vest and be
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time and (b) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Stock Option Plan or in any stock option
agreement, each Outstanding Option shall be deemed to have been cancelled
prior to the Effective Time in exchange for the right to receive the
consideration described in _Section 2.9_ below, payable in cash to the holder
thereof pursuant to _Section 2.14_ below. The Company shall take such
actions, including amending the Stock Option Plan and stock option
agreements, as may be required to facilitate the foregoing.

 



3 2.9 Allocation of Merger Consideration. Subject to _Section 2.10_ below, the
Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the holders of Outstanding
Common Shares and Outstanding Option Shares as follows:

(a) each Outstanding Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Price; and

(b) each Outstanding Option shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Price
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of Outstanding Option Shares for which such
Outstanding Option is exercisable; provided, however, there shall be
subtracted from the amount payable to an Optionholder an amount equal to the
portion of the Option Consideration payable by such Optionholder for the
Outstanding Option Shares pursuant to such Optionholders Options.

The amounts payable above to the Common Shareholders and Optionholders on a
per share basis, reduced by the amounts to be paid to the Indemnification
Escrow Agent and deposited into the Indemnification Escrow Account, are
sometimes referred to herein as the " _Common Per Share Closing
Consideration_ ", and, for each Optionholder, such Optionholders applicable "
_Option Per Share Closing Consideration_ ", respectively.

2.10 Adjustments to Merger Consideration.

(a) The parties intend that, on the Closing Date, the Company will have $0
(the " _Target Closing NWC_ ") of Net Working Capital. To the extent that the
Company has less than the Target Closing NWC on the close of business on the
Closing Date, such deficiency will be deducted from the Base Amount, as the "
_Net Working Capital Adjustment_."

(b) The parties intend that, on the Closing Date, the Company will have $0
(the " _Target Closing Indebtedness_ ") of Indebtedness. To the extent that
the Company has more than the Target Closing Indebtedness on the close of
business on the Closing Date, such additional debt will be deducted from the
Base Amount, as the " _Debt Adjustment_."

(c) No later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to
Parent a statement (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in
good faith its computations of estimated Net Working Capital (the "
_Preliminary Closing NWC_ ") and estimated Indebtedness (the " _Preliminary
Closing Indebtedness_ ") as of the close of business on the anticipated
Closing Date. The parties will use the Preliminary Closing NWC and
Preliminary Closing Indebtedness to calculate the Common Per Share Closing
Consideration and Option Per Share Closing Consideration for purposes of
Closing.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the Joint Representatives shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to Parent a statement (the " _Post-Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth the calculation of Net Working Capital and
Indebtedness as of the close of business on the the Closing Date. The Post-
Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP and,
to the extent not inconsistent with GAAP, in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Company. Parent shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the Joint Representatives (and their respective representatives) in
connection with the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, including
affording the Joint Representatives (and their respective representatives)
reasonable access to all books and records and all financial and accounting
personnel of the Surviving Corporation.

 



4 (e) Parent shall have thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Post-Closing
Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the information and
calculations provided therein. During the Review Period, the Joint
Representatives shall afford Parent (and its representatives) reasonable
access to all books and records and all financial and accounting personnel
used to prepare the Post-Closing Statement under control of or in the
possession of the Joint Representatives.

(f) Parent may dispute the calculation of the Post-Closing Statement within
the Review Period by providing written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the
Joint Representatives of such dispute, setting forth in detail the
particulars of such dispute, including Parents calculation of Net Working
Capital and Indebtedness. In the event that Parent does not deliver a Dispute
Notice within the Review Period, then the Post-Closing Statement shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto. In the event a Dispute Notice is
timely provided, Parent and the Joint Representatives shall use their
reasonable best efforts for a period of thirty (30) days (or such longer
period as to which they shall mutually agree) to resolve the disputed
matters. If, at the end of such period, the Joint Representatives and Parent
are unable to resolve the disputed matters, then the Joint Representatives and
Parent shall, within five (5) days of the end of such period, jointly submit
all disputed matters raised in the Dispute Notice and not so resolved (the "
_Disputed Matters_ ") to the Arbiter (to be selected as set forth in
subsection (g) below) for final resolution in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The determination of the Arbiter shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall be limited to Disputed Matters.
All fees and disbursements of the Arbiter shall be paid by Parent. The
determination of the Arbiter shall be reflected in a written report which
shall be delivered by the Arbiter to the Joint Representatives and Parent no
later than thirty (30) days following the submission of the Disputed Matters
to the Arbiter for resolution.

(g) The Arbiter (the _"Arbiter"_ ) shall be a regional or nationally
recognized accounting firm jointly selected by Parent and the Joint
Representatives (other than any accounting firm which has been employed by the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, in the last two (2)
years) (an " _independent accounting firm"_ ). In the event that Parent and
the Joint Representatives are unable to jointly agree upon the Arbiter, then
Parent, on the one hand, and the Joint Representatives, on the other hand,
shall each select an independent accounting firm to select the Arbiter, and
such two (2) independent accounting firms shall have twenty (20) days
thereafter to mutually select the Arbiter, which selection shall be binding
upon Parent and the Joint Representatives.

(h) The final, conclusive, and binding Net Working Capital amount determined
in accordance with this  _Section 2.10_ will be the " _Final Closing NWC_."
The final, conclusive, and binding Indebtedness amount determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.10_ will be the " _Final Closing
Indebtedness_." 

(i) If (A) the amount of the Final Closing NWC reduced by the Final Closing
Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or negative amount) is _less_
than (B) the amount of the Preliminary Closing NWC reduced by the Preliminary
Closing Indebtedness (whether such amount is a positive or negative amount),
then the Joint Representatives shall instruct the Escrow Agent within two (2)
Business Days after the date of final determination to release from the
Indemnification Escrow Account the amount of the shortfall to Parent. The
Indemnification Escrow Account shall be the sole source of payment for any
decrease in the Merger Consideration arising out of this _Section 2.10_.

 



5 2.11 Dissenters Rights.

 

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
provide each record holder of Common Stock who shall not have voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, with notice of such holders
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 13.1-734 of the VSCA. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal pursuant to Section
13.1-735.1 of the VSCA received by the Company from any Common Shareholder,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
VSCA and received by the Company in connection therewith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Outstanding Common Shares that are held immediately prior to the Effective
Time by holders who have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented
thereto in writing and who have demanded and perfected the right, if any, for
appraisal of such Outstanding Common Shares in accordance with the provisions
of Section 13.1-735.1 of the VSCA and have not withdrawn or lost such right
to appraisal (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be converted
into or represent a right to receive any of the Merger Consideration, but
the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to such appraisal
rights as are granted by the VSCA. If a holder of Outstanding Common Shares
who demands appraisal of such Outstanding Common Shares under the VSCA shall
thereafter effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal with respect to such Outstanding Common
Shares then, as of the occurrence of such withdrawal or loss, each such
Outstanding Common Share shall be deemed to have been converted into and
represent only the right to receive, in accordance with _Sections 2.6_ and
_2.9_ , the per share portion of the Merger Consideration.

2.12 Closing of Transfer Books. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Common Stock
shall thereafter be made, except as provided in _Section 4.1_ below. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership
of Outstanding Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Outstanding Shares, except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by Applicable Law.

2.13 Closing Payments. At the Closing, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
the following amounts by wire transfers of immediately available funds:

(a) Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited the Indemnification Escrow
Amount with the Indemnification Escrow Agent;

(b) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all Company Transaction Costs that
remain outstanding as of the Closing Date to such account or accounts as are
designated by the Company in accordance with  _Section 4.5_; and

(c) Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited an amount equal to (i) the
Merger Consideration, _minus_ (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, _minus_
(iii) the amount of the Merger Consideration, if any, paid directly to any
Common Shareholder or Optionholder pursuant to _Section 2.14(c)_, with
a trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Joint
Representatives (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for payment to the Securityholders in
accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying Agent.

 



6 2.14 Payment.

 

(a) The funds received by the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.10(i)_,
_Section 2.13(c)_, _Section 5.6_,  _Article X_ and the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement shall be deposited by the Paying Agent in an account (the "
_Exchange Account_ ") established for the benefit of the Securityholders. The
Paying Agent shall pay:

 

(i) out of the Exchange Account, to each Common Shareholder (other than those
Common Shareholders paid pursuant to Section 2.14(c)), holding a Certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Outstanding Common
Shares, promptly upon receipt by the Paying Agent of a completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and the Certificate, an amount equal to
the product of (A) the number of Outstanding Common Shares previously
represented by such Certificate, _multiplied_ by (B) the Common Per Share
Closing Consideration; and

 

(ii) out of the Exchange Account, to each Optionholder (other than those
Optionholders paid pursuant to Section 2.14(c)), promptly upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of a completed and duly executed Option Surrender Agreement, for
each Outstanding Option held by such Optionholder and being surrendered by
such Optionholder pursuant to the Option Surrender Agreement, an amount equal
to the applicable Option Per Share Closing Consideration payable for such
Outstanding Option.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver:

(i) to each record holder of Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be substantially in the form
attached as  _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for
the consideration such Common Shareholder has the right to receive under
this  _Article II_, as applicable; and

(ii) to each holder of an Option (A) an option surrender
agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ hereto (the "
_Option Surrender Agreement_ ") and (B) instructions for effecting the
surrender of such Option in exchange for the consideration such Optionholder
has the right to receive under this _Article II_.

(c) Each Common Shareholder who delivers a completed and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal and a Certificate for cancellation to Parent at the
Closing shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration
such Shareholder has the right to receive under this _Article II_ , as
applicable. Each Optionholder who delivers to Parent a duly executed Option
Surrender Agreement at Closing shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the consideration such Optionholder has the right to receive under
this _Article II_. All such amounts shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on the Closing Date to an account designated in
writing by each such Securityholder no less than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.

 



7 (d) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Securityholder
pursuant to this _Article II_ any amounts as the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
payment under any provision of applicable Tax law. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the

materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. Parent directly owns all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Subsidiary, free and clear

this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein and therein have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate or shareholder action on the part of Parent and Merger Subsidiary.
No other proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary are necessary
to authorize this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which

delivery will be, duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary, as applicable, and, assuming that this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents constitute the valid and binding agreement of
the other parties thereto, constitute, or upon execution and delivery will
constitute, the valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance with their
respective terms and conditions, except that the enforcement hereof and
thereof may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



19 (c) No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which either is a party do not, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not, (i)
violate, conflict with, or result in any breach of any provisions of the
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary; (ii)
violate, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a
default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) under, any of

such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults as would not interfere with
the ability of either of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which
it is a party. No Consent of any Governmental Authority is required by or
with respect to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents to which either of them is a party or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, except for
(A) filings under the HSR Act, (B) the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia, (C) the
consent of the District of Columbia Public Service Commission and the Virginia

perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which either of them is or will be a party.

(d) Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit or
judicial or administrative proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, threatened against Parent or Merger Subsidiary relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or which, if adversely

to perform its obligations and agreements under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party and to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein and therein.

(e) Financing. Parent has and shall have at the Closing sufficient Cash and
available credit facilities to pay the full Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, to make all other necessary
payments by it in connection with transactions contemplated hereby and to pay
all of its related fees and expenses, and has and shall maintain through the

and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement are true and correct
in all material respects, at and immediately after the Effective Time, and
after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

professionals fee and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with
any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or
other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such Person in
any such capacity whether pertaining to any act or omission occurring or
existing prior to, at or after the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (" _D andO Indemnified
Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, in
each case to the fullest extent a corporation is permitted under the VSCA to
indemnify its own directors or officers (and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
to each DandO Indemnified Person to the fullest extent a corporation is
permitted under the VSCA to advance expenses to its directors and officers in
connection with claims, actions and suits involving such Persons). In
determining whether a DandO Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 5.4_, if requested by such DandO Indemnified Person, such
determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by the
Surviving Corporation and approved by the DandO Indemnified Person (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and who has not otherwise
performed services for the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates within the
last three (3) years (other than in connection with such matters). Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation is brought against any DandO Indemnified Persons (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the DandO Indemnified Persons
may retain the Companys regularly engaged independent legal counsel or
other counsel satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(or satisfactory to them and reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time), and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the DandO Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received
and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their best efforts to
assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter, provided that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). Any DandO Indemnified Person wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 5.4_, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Surviving
Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any
liability that it may have under this _Section 5.4_ except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices such partys position with respect to such
claims) and, if applicable, shall deliver to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 13.1-699.A.2 of the VSCA,
but without any requirement for the posting of a bond or any other terms or
conditions other than those expressly set forth herein.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify the Articles of Incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
or manage the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at and at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor any indemnification agreements between the
Company and any of its directors, officers or employees.

 



28 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any DandO Indemnified
Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon request as provided
in _Section 5.4(a)_, relating to the enforcement of such DandO
Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section 5.4_ or under any charter,
bylaw or contract regardless of whether such DandO Indemnified Person is
ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or
thereunder. Any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ shall be payable
upon request by the DandO Indemnified Person and shall bear interest from the
date such were originally due and payable at a rate equal to the prime rate of
interest as announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as in effect on the date
of such initial request plus 3%.

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering the DandO
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance
policies on terms no less advantageous to such DandO Indemnified Persons than
such existing insurance; provided, however, that neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required in order to maintain such policies to
pay an annual premium in excess of 300% of the greater of (i) the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement and (ii) the
annual premium for the year in which the Closing occurs (the " _Cap_ "); and
provided, further, that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be
obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, then Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain policies that, in
Parents good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an
annual premium equal to the Cap.

 

5.5 WARN Act. For a period of ninety-one (91) days (inclusive) following the
Closing Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation to not, implement any plant
closing, mass layoff or other termination of employees which, either alone or
in the aggregate (with each other and/or with any plant closing, mass layoff
or other termination of employees by the Company on or prior to the Closing
Date), would create any obligations upon or liabilities for any Securityholder
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (by the " _WARN
Act_ ") or similar Applicable Laws.

 



29 5.6 Tax Matters.

 

(a) The parties agree to treat the transactions contemplated herein as a
taxable purchase of the capital stock of the Company and will file all Tax
Returns in a manner consistent therewith.

(b) Parent shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary to prepare and file
all Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period for which
Tax Returns are not yet due as of the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall
be prepared (i) in a manner consistent with past practice, except as
otherwise required by law and (ii) for a Pre-Closing Short Year, in
accordance with the "end of the day" rule of Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1). To remove uncertainty, the Company, the
Securityholders and Parent agree that each such Tax Return for a Pre-Closing
Short Year shall not be prepared using the "next day" rule of Treas. Reg.
§1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). These principles shall be applied regardless of the
Surviving Corporations eligibility or election to file a consolidated Tax
Return for the Post-Closing Tax Year. The Surviving Corporation and/or the
Subsidiaries shall pay all Taxes shown as due and owing on such Tax Returns.
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries shall permit the
Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.6(a)_, the Company and
each Subsidiary shall file income Tax Returns for the Pre-Closing Short Year.
The Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for the Pre-Closing Short
Year shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, report deductions
relating to payments to Optionholders in respect of the Outstanding Options
pursuant to _Section 2.8_. To remove uncertainty, no deduction relating to
payments to Optionholders pursuant to  _Section 2.8_ that are permitted
under applicable law to be deducted in any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
recognized in any Post-Closing Tax Year.

(d) Parent and the Joint Representatives shall, and shall each cause their
respective Affiliates to, provide to the other such cooperation and
information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund
(including an IRS Form 4466), determining liability for Taxes or a right to
refund of Taxes, or in conducting any action with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings and
other determinations by taxing authorities, and relevant records concerning
the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such party may possess.
Each party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers, and all
material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the Company
and the Subsidiaries for the Tax period first ending after the Closing Date
and for all prior Tax periods until the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notice is provided with respect thereto,
any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other
documents relate. Thereafter, the party holding such Tax Returns or other
documents may dispose of them provided that such party shall give to the other
party written notice prior to doing so. Each party shall make its employees
reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide
explanation of any documents or information so provided.

 

(e) The Securityholders shall pay and shall indemnify Parent, the Company, and
the Subsidiaries of the Company against all Pre-Closing Period Taxes and Pre-
Closing Straddle Period Taxes (including any Taxes imposed on the Company or a
Subsidiary as a transferee or successor of any Person (including, but not
limited to, any liability arising under Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-6) or resulting
from any tax allocation, tax indemnification or tax sharing contract or
agreement to which the Company or a Subsidiary is a party) in excess of the
amount with respect to such Tax that is reflected as a liability in the
calculation of Net Working Capital.

 



30 (f) The Securityholders shall be entitled to all Tax refunds or credits
against tax otherwise owed attributable to Pre-Closing Period Taxes and Pre-
Closing Straddle Period Taxes. Within seven (7) days of receipt of a Tax
refund or a credit, Parent shall pay to the Joint Representatives (on behalf
of the Securityholders) the amount of such refund or credit (less any amount
reflected as an asset in the calculation of Net Working Capital) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds. Such amount shall be delivered to the
Paying Agent for deposit in the Exchange Account, and will be paid-out to the
Securityholders as provided in _Section 2.14_ above, and shall be considered
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

(g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
similar transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid equally by the
Securityholders and the Parent. The party required by applicable law shall
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such
Taxes and, if required by applicable law, the other party or parties
shall join in the execution of such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(h) Payments made pursuant to _Section 5.6(e)_ and _Section 5.6(f)_ shall
be treated as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

(i) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Section
5.6_ and the provisions of _Article X_ , the provisions of this _Section 5.6_
shall control with respect to Taxes.

5.7 Employee Bonuses.

The Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay employee bonuses in
the amount of $125,000 to Susan Hageman and amounts not to exceed $100,000 for
any other employee and $625,000 in the aggregate as specified by the Company
at least five business days prior to the Closing Date. Such bonuses will be
paid 50% on the Closing Date and 50% on the date three months after the
Closing Date, contingent only upon the continued employment of each such
employee. For purposes of clarification, the amount of such bonuses, together
with all Taxes related thereto, will be treated as a current liability for
purposes of Net Working Capital. If any such employees are not employed on the
date of the second payment, the amounts shall be reallocated among the
remaining employees.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

MUTUAL COVENANTS

6.1 Governmental Consents.

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to applicable
Antitrust Laws, to which _Sections 6.1(b)_, _(c)_ and _(d)_ , and not this
_Section 6.1(a)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities such Consents that are necessary in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters.

 



31 (b) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the parties
shall file, or cause to be filed by their respective " _ultimate parent
entities_ ," with the FTC and the DOJ the notifications and other information
(if any) required to be filed under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents, which notifications
will include a request for early termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Authorities such additional requests, reports or notifications as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and shall diligently and
expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the
prosecution of, such matters. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish to
the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission which is necessary under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall
keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ.
Subject to the following proviso, Parent shall take whatever action is
necessary, including an agreement to (i) sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate and agree to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of
assets or businesses of the Company or Parent or eithers respective
Subsidiaries; (ii) terminate such existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations of the Company or Parent or eithers respective
Subsidiaries; (iii) terminate any relevant venture or other arrangement; or
(iv) effectuate any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent
(and, in each case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an
order or decree or file appropriate applications with the FTC, DOJ or other
Governmental Authority), in each case with respect to the foregoing clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) (each a " _Divestiture Condition_ "), if such action
is reasonably likely to be necessary to satisfy the closing conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1(a)(i) and 7.1(b); provided that, notwithstanding the
above, the Parent shall not be obligated to agree to or undertake Divestiture
Conditions that in the aggregate involve assets, relationships, contractual
rights, arrangements, or restructurings with a value in the aggregate in
excess of $5,000,000. Parent shall be entitled to direct any proceedings
or negotiations with any Governmental Authority relating to any of the
foregoing, provided that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity
to participate therein. In addition, Parent shall take such action as may be
required by any federal or state court of the United States, in any action
brought by a Governmental Authority or any other Person challenging the Merger
as violative of the Antitrust Laws, including as set forth in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) or (iv) above (subject to the applicable proviso), in order to
avoid the entry of any permanent injunction or other permanent order which
would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the Merger,
and in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order
is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding
that would make consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain,
enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall take promptly any
and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such injunction or order
so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination Date.

(c) The failure of Parent to discharge, satisfy or remove such
Divestiture Condition, the failure by Parent to obtain clearance or
expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law or the failure by Parent to cause to be vacated,
modified or suspended any injunction or order resulting from a claim that the
Merger is violative of any Antitrust Laws, in each case prior to the
Termination Date, shall be deemed a material breach by Parent of this
Agreement, unless such failure results from the Companys failure, in
any material respect, to perform its obligations under this _Section 6.1_.

 



32 (d) From the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall not take any action that could reasonably be expected to
hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

(e) Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall each pay one-half of
the filing fee required under the HSR Act and all other applicable Antitrust
Laws.

6.2 Investigation and Agreement by Parent and Merger Subsidiary; No Other
Representations or Warranties.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that it has
made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
businesses and operations, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary have been
furnished with or given full access to such information about the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations as they requested. In
connection with Parents and Merger Subsidiarys investigation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective representatives have received from the Company
or its representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the Company
and its Subsidiaries and certain estimates, plans and budget information.
Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such projections, forecasts,
estimates, plans and budgets; (ii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary are familiar
with such uncertainties; and (iii) Parent and Merger Subsidiary are taking
full responsibility for making their own evaluations of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so
furnished to them or their representatives.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties made by the Company that are expressly set
forth in _Section 3.1_ of this Agreement, none of the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company, any Securityholder, or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives has made and shall not be deemed to have made to any of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or representatives
any representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations and
warranties made by the Company and set forth in _Section 3.1_, each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary agrees that none of the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, any Securityholder, or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty to Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or to any of their respective representatives or Affiliates
with respect to:

 

(i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenue,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective representatives or Affiliates;
or

 



33 (ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their
respective representatives or Affiliates, including the information contained
in the electronic data room, with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except as expressly covered by representations and
warranties made by the Company and set forth in _Section 3.1_.

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary as expressly set forth in
_Section 3.2_, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives makes or has made to any of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, any Securityholder or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives any representation or warranty of any kind.

preceding the Termination Date (the " _Cure Period_ "); and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, there shall be no Cure Period for Parents
failure to obtain all funds on or prior to the Closing Date necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof and thereof (which failure shall constitute a material
breach of this Agreement);

(ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which
order, decree or ruling Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best
efforts to lift), in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any party who did not use reasonable best efforts to lift any
such order, decree, ruling or other action or whose failure to comply with
_Section 6.1_ has been the primary cause of the condition set forth in this
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ not being satisfied; or

(iii) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m. on
November 15, 2012 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided however that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(iii) shall not be
available if the failure of the party so requesting termination to fulfill
any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date.

 



38 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.1_, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation
hereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or shareholders, except
that _Article I_, this _Article IX_ and _Article XI_ shall survive such
termination.

 

9.3 Fees and Expenses Following Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
(a) by the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or (b) by Parent for any
reason not set forth in _Section 9.1_, then in either such case Parent shall,
within three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay to the Company the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds. In addition,
Parent shall reimburse the Company for its out-of-pocket legal, accounting,
investment banker and other professional fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein within three (3)
Business Days after Company notifies Parent of the amount thereof. The Company
and Parent acknowledge and hereby agree that the provisions of this _Section
9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and that, without such provisions the Company, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary would not have entered into this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee provided for
in this _Section 9.3_ constitutes liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and
is reasonable in the event of a termination by Parent for any reason not
provided for in _Section 9.1_. The payment by Parent of the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ shall be the sole remedy of the Company with
respect to the termination by the Company or any breach of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary. If Parent shall fail to pay in a timely manner
the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company makes a claim against Parent that results in a judgment
against the Parent, Parent shall pay to the Company the reasonable costs and
expenses of the Company (including its reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.3_ at the prime
lending rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street
Journal. Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but excluding) the
date of actual payment, and on the basis of a 360-day year.

9.4 Return of Information. Within ten (10) Business Days following termination
of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_, Parent shall, and shall
cause Merger Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates and representatives
to, return to the Company, or destroy, all Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) furnished or made available to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and their respective Affiliates and
representatives by or on behalf of the Company, and all analyses,
compilations, data, studies, notes, interpretations, memoranda or other
documents prepared by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives (including electronic copies thereof) that refer
to, relate to, discuss or contain, or are based on, in whole or in part, any
such Information. Parent shall deliver a certificate signed by its Chief
Executive Officer, which certificate shall provide evidence reasonably
substantiating the return or destruction of the Information as required under
this  _Section 9.4_.

 



39 ARTICLE X

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The
representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
set forth in this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents, and in any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents and the right of an Indemnified Person to assert any
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ shall survive the
Closing until 5:00 p.m. on the date that is 18 months following the Closing
Date (as modified by the following proviso, the " _Expiration Date_ ");
_provided, however_ , that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 3.1(a)_ ( _b_ ), ( _c_ ), ( _d_ ) and ( _e_ ) relating to the
organization and capitalization of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
Section 3.2(b) relating to authority ( _Sections 3.1(a)_ , ( _b_ ), ( _c_ ), (
_d_ ) and ( _e_ ) and _3.2(b)_  are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive indefinitely, (b) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.1(o)_ relating to
Taxes shall survive until close of business on the 120th day following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (c) the covenants and
other agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement and in the other Transaction Documents shall survive the
Closing Date in accordance with their terms.

10.2 Indemnification of the Parent Indemnified Persons. Subject to the
limitations on recourse and recovery set forth in this _Article X_ , from and
after the Closing, the Securityholders, acting through the Joint
Representatives, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Parent
Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses imposed upon
or incurred by any Parent Indemnified Person after the Closing, in connection
with, arising out of or resulting from (a " _Parent Indemnification Claim_ "):

(a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in _Section 3.1_, or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of
the Company to Parent prior to the Closing in connection with this Agreement
(giving effect to any limitations or qualifications thereto, including
materiality or Material Adverse Effect, for purposes of determining whether a
breach has occurred but not for purposes of determining Losses therefrom and
it being understood that any Supplemental Disclosure Letter delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the Closing Date shall not be taken into
consideration for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations
and warranties unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company).

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach by the Company of any covenant or agreement
made by the Company under this Agreement and which is required to be performed
by the Company at or prior to the Closing.

10.3 Indemnification of the Securityholder Indemnified Persons. From and after
the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholder Indemnified
Persons from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by any
Securityholder Indemnified Person after the Closing in connection with,
arising out of or resulting from (a " _Securityholder Indemnification Claim_
"):

 



40 (a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary in _Section 3.2_, or in any certificate delivered by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to the Company in connection with
this Agreement (giving effect to any limitations or qualifications thereto,
including materiality or Material Adverse Effect, for purposes of determining
whether a breach has occurred but not for purposes of determining Losses
therefrom); or

(b) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement (i) made by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement or (ii) made by the Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement and, in the case of this clause (ii), which
is required to be performed after the Closing.

10.4 Limitations.

 

(a) Minimum Loss. The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to be
indemnified for Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $585,000 (the " _Minimum Loss_ ")
and otherwise satisfy all other requirements under this _Section 10.4_. After
the Minimum Loss is exceeded, Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
be paid the entire amount of any Losses pursuant to _Section 10.2_ in excess
of (but not including) the Minimum Loss, subject to the limitations on
recovery and recourse set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) Limitation as to Time. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any
Losses that are indemnifiable under  _Section 10.2(a)_ or _Section 10.3(a)_
unless a written claim for indemnification under this Agreement is delivered
by the Indemnified Person to the Indemnifying Person with respect thereto
prior to the applicable Expiration Date.

(c) Sole and Exclusive Remedy; Recourse Against Escrowed Funds.

 

(i) Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company and the Securityholders
acknowledges and agrees that, after the Closing, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parent Indemnified Persons and the Securityholder Indemnified Persons with
respect to claims for Losses or otherwise, including those set forth in
_Sections 10.2_ and _10.3_ , in connection with, arising out of or resulting
from the subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (except for the equitable remedies described in Section 11.19
and claims arising out of fraud and for claims for injunctive relief) shall
be in accordance with, and limited solely to indemnification under, the
provisions of this _Article X_ and, with respect to Parent Indemnification
Claims, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Support Agreement;
provided, however, that the Joint Representatives shall remain entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(c)_.

 



41 (ii) Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation further
acknowledge and agree that the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive source of funds for satisfaction of all claims by Parent
Indemnified Persons for Losses or otherwise, including those set forth in
_Section 10.2_, in connection with, arising out of or resulting from the
subject matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided, however_ , that the foregoing clause shall not apply to breaches of
Fundamental Representations or to inaccuracies or breaches of _Section
3.1(o)_ or the non-fulfillment or breach of Section 5.6; _provided, further_ ,
that certain Securityholders shall enter into a Support Agreement (the "
_Support Agreement_ "), in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ , pursuant
to which such Securityholders shall be severally, but not jointly, responsible
for Losses related to inaccuracies or breaches of Fundamental Representations
or inaccuracies or breaches of  _Section 3.1(o)_ or or the non-fulfillment
or breach of Section 5.6 in excess of the Indemnification Escrow Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such time as the Indemnification Escrow
Amount is exhausted or released, Parent Indemnified Persons shall be
prohibited from asserting a claim against the Securityholders for Losses
related to inaccuracies or breaches of Fundamental Representations or
inaccuracies or breaches of _Section 3.1(o)_ or the non-fulfillment or
breach of Section 5.6, and in no event shall a Securityholder have any
liability in excess of such Securityholders portion of the Merger
Consideration.

(iii) Except as expressly set forth in the Support Agreement, no
Securityholder shall have any liability to the Parent Indemnified Persons in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than such Securityholders _pro rata_ share of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, which shall be available to satisfy Losses of Parent Indemnified
Persons, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Except as expressly set forth in the Support Agreement, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, on their own behalf and on behalf of each other Parent
Indemnified Person, hereby covenant forever not to assert, file, prosecute,
commence or institute (or sponsor or purposely facilitate any Person in
connection with the foregoing) any complaint or lawsuit or any legal,
equitable, arbitral or administrative proceeding of any nature against any of
the Securityholders in connection with any Parent Indemnification Claim. At
and after such time as the Indemnification Escrow Amount is exhausted or
released, the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to seek
indemnity under this _Article X_ , and the Parent Indemnified Persons shall
have no further recourse against any Person for any unpaid Losses of any
Parent Indemnified Person, except to the extent set forth in the Support
Agreement.

(d) Characterization of Payments. For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to
treat (and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any
indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Merger
Consideration payable to the Securityholders pursuant to _Article II_ unless a
final and nonappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority
(which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form)
provides otherwise; provided that the Indemnifying Persons prior written
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) will
be obtained by the Indemnified Person who seeks to accept, via a
settlement or compromise with any such Governmental Authority, a position
that is contrary to treatment of an indemnity payment as an adjustment to the
Merger Consideration payable to the Securityholders pursuant to _Article II_.

 

10.5 Third Party Claims.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any Indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any action, proceeding, demand, claim or
investigation by a third party or circumstances which, with the lapse of
time, such Indemnified Person believes is likely to give rise to an action,
proceeding, demand, claim or investigation by a third party (an " _Asserted
Liability_ ") that may result in a Loss, such Indemnified Person shall
give written notice thereof (the " _Claims Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying
Persons. The Claims Notice shall describe the Asserted Liability in reasonable
detail, and shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary) of the Loss
that has been or may be suffered. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article X except to the extent that the Indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced by such failure.

 



42 (b) If the Indemnifying Persons acknowledge in writing their obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Persons against any and all Losses that may result
from an Asserted Liability, the Indemnifying Persons shall be, subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 10.5_, entitled to assume control of
and appoint lead counsel for such defense; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Persons shall not have the right to assume control of the defense
of any Asserted Liability (i) to the extent that the object of such Asserted
Liability is to obtain an injunction, restraining order, declaratory relief
or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Person which, if
successful, would materially adversely affect the business, operations,
assets, or financial condition of the Indemnified Person, or (ii) if the
named parties to any such action or proceeding (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnified Persons and the Indemnifying Persons and
the former shall have been advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to
the Indemnifying Persons) that there are one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to them that are different from or additional to those
available to Indemnifying Persons; provided, further, that to exercise such
rights the Indemnifying Person must give notice to the Indemnified Person
within 30 days after receipt of any such Claims Notice whether it is agreeing
to accept responsibility and assuming control of and appointing lead counsel
for such defense. If the Indemnifying Person does not give such notice within
such 30-day period or either proviso in this _Section 10.5(b)_ applies, then
the Indemnified Person shall have the right to assume control of the defense
thereof at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person.

(c) If the Indemnifying Person shall assume the control of the defense of the
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.5_,
(i) the Indemnifying Person shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Person before entering into any settlement, compromise, admission
or acknowledgement of the validity of such Asserted Liability if the
settlement does not unconditionally release the Indemnified Person from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Asserted Liability or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Person and (ii) the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
participate, at its own cost and expense, in the defense of such Asserted
Liability and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The
fees, costs and expenses of any such separate counsel to the Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be paid by the Indemnified
Person.

(d) If the Indemnified Person shall assume the control of the defense of any
Asserted Liability in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 10.5_,
the Indemnified Party shall have the sole right to assume the defense of and
settle such Asserted Liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate, at its cost and expense,
in the defense of such Asserted Liability and to employ separate counsel of
its choice for such purpose, and the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to
contest the reasonableness of any such settlement to which it does not
consent.

 



43 (e) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Asserted Liability and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony
(subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement), and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(f) The fees, costs and expenses of the Joint Representatives legal counsel
and any experts (including expert witnesses), consultants and other
representatives engaged by them in connection with (i) the Joint
Representatives assumption of the defense of an Asserted Liability pursuant
to this _Section 10.5_ on behalf of the Securityholder Indemnified Persons as
Indemnified Persons or (ii) the Joint Representatives participation in the
defense of an Asserted Liability pursuant to this  _Section 10.5_ on behalf
of the Securityholder Indemnified Persons as Indemnified Persons, in each
case, shall be unlimited and shall be paid out of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount.

 

10.6 Direct Claims. In any case in which an Indemnified Person seeks
indemnification hereunder which is not subject to  _Section 10.5_ because no
Asserted Liability is involved, the Indemnified Person shall notify the
Indemnifying Person in writing of any Losses that such Indemnified Person
claims are subject to indemnification under the terms hereof. The failure of
the Indemnified Person to exercise promptness in such notification shall not
amount to a waiver of such claim unless and only to the extent that the
resulting delay materially and adversely prejudices the position of the
Indemnifying Person with respect to such claim.

10.7 Other Claims. In connection with any Losses for which an Indemnified
Person may seek indemnification under this _Article X_ , such Indemnified
Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek and pursue any
available insurance coverage or other claims against third parties that such
Indemnified Person may have in respect of such Losses and the amount of
insurance proceeds or other recoveries actually received by the Indemnified
Person less any deductibles and the related reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in recovering such amounts shall
not be included in Losses that such Indemnified Person may recover under this
_Article X_ and if the Indemnified Person receives any such amounts subsequent
to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Person in respect of such
Losses, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Person for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Person in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the above
amounts so received by the Indemnified Person.

10.8 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation or Knowledge. If the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, Parent expressly reserves the right to
seek indemnity or other remedy pursuant to _Article X_ of this Agreement for
any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, notwithstanding any
investigation by, or knowledge of, such party in respect of any fact or
circumstances that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before
or after the execution and delivery hereof.

 



44 ARTICLE XI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances. 

(a) Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable (subject to any Applicable Laws) to consummate the Merger and
make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as promptly as practicable,
including (i) the obtaining of all Consents of, and the making of all
registrations, declarations and filings with, Governmental Authorities and
(ii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. In addition,
no party hereto shall take any action after the date of this Agreement to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any Consent
from any Governmental Authority necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any bills of sale,
assignment or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

11.2 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended only by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto, provided that such
amendment has been authorized by action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors; provided, however, that no amendment shall be made which by
Applicable Law requires further approval by a partys shareholders without
such further approval.

11.3 Waiver of Compliance. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.3_,
any failure of Parent or Merger Subsidiary on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition contained herein may be waived only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound by such waiver
(including, if such waiver is after the Closing, the third-party beneficiaries
set forth in _Section 11.6_), but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any other
failure.

11.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Applicable Law or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Governmental Authority making such determination is authorized and instructed
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in order that the transactions contemplated herein are
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



45 11.5 Expenses and Obligations. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses.

 

11.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and permitted
assigns. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement except as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (a) _Article II_ , _Section
6.2_, _Article X_ , _Article XI_ and _Article XII_ are made for the benefit of
the Securityholders, (b) _Sections 3.2(f)_ , _5.4_ ,  _5.5_ and _Article XI_
are made for the benefit of any of the Companys and/or its Subsidiaries (i)
directors and officers, and (ii) former directors and officers, and (c)
Article X and Article XI are made for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified
Persons. From and after the Closing, all of the Persons identified in clauses
(a) through (c) in the immediately preceding sentence shall be entitled to
enforce such provisions and to avail themselves of the benefits of any remedy
for any breach of such provisions, all to the same extent as if such Persons
were parties to this Agreement.

and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
shall be deemed the work product of the parties and may not be construed
against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law
or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in
this Agreement against any party that draft it is of no application and is
hereby expressly waived.

 



48 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be
deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue
of the inclusion of such information in the Disclosure Schedules, that such
information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such
items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case

extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or
warranties is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding
the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedules
with respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate
cross reference thereto.

warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules is

any Securityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with this Agreement,
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or any other Transaction Document, unless
by the Joint Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct, and
(ii) the Joint Representatives shall be entitled to rely on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Joint Representatives pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject the
Joint Representatives to liability to any Securityholder unless by the Joint
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. Except as set forth
in the previous sentence, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Joint Representatives, in their role as Joint Representatives,
shall have no liability whatsoever to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or the Surviving Corporation or any other Person.



 



53 (c) Each Securityholder, severally, shall indemnify the Joint Representatives
up to, but not exceeding, an amount equal to the aggregate portion of the
amounts received by such Person under _Article II_ of this Agreement, which
indemnification shall be paid by such Securityholder _pro rata_ in accordance
with the portion of the aggregate amounts received by such Person under
_Article II_ of this Agreement, against all damages, liabilities, claims,
obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants
and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against either of

obligations, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys, accountants
and other experts fees and the amount of any judgment against the Joint
Representatives that arise from the Joint Representatives gross negligence or
willful misconduct, including the willful breach of this Agreement or the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement. The foregoing indemnification shall not
be deemed exclusive of any other right to which the Joint Representatives may
be entitled apart from the provisions hereof and is intended to provide the
Joint Representatives indemnity for their own negligence. In the event of any
indemnification under this _Section 12.2(c)_, each Securityholder shall
promptly deliver to the Joint Representatives full payment of his, her or its
ratable share of such Indemnification Claim.

 

(d) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Joint
Representatives under this Agreement shall survive the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

(e) The Joint Representatives shall, from time to time, be entitled to
request and receive out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount such amounts as
may be necessary to reimburse the Joint Representatives for all reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Joint Representatives in the
exercise of their rights or the performance of their duties hereunder, up to a
