thereto in writing and who is entitled to exercise and has properly exercised
and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in compliance in all
respects with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
consideration for such Company Capital Stock as set forth in _Section
2.6(a)_, and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to
such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section 262 of the
DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and
such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive (A) the appraised value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL or

 



-16-   (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall properly withdraw or lose such holders appraisal rights in accordance
with  _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_).

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.6(c)(i)_, if any holder
of Dissenting Shares shall properly withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such
event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital
Stock as set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_, without interest, upon surrender of
the certificate representing such shares.

by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock, attempted
written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights to
appraisal with respect to the Merger and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise of such appraisal
rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for payment of fair value for capital stock of the Company or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

(d) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

2.7 _Company Options and Company Warrants_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each share subject to a Vested Company Option shall
be converted into and represent the right to receive an amount of cash
(without interest), if any, equal to:

(i) at Closing, the Per Share Closing Option Consideration (to be paid in
accordance with _Section 2.9_);

(ii) upon release from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions
of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, the applicable Per Share Escrow
Amount, _less_ the proportionate amount of any amounts properly paid in
satisfaction of, or properly subject to pending, claims for Losses made
in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement;

(iii) upon release from the Representative Reimbursement Fund pursuant to the
terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, the
applicable Per Share Representative Reimbursement Amount, _less_ the
proportionate amount of any Representative Expenses properly paid or pending
in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement; and

(iv) the amount, if any, payable with respect to such Vested Company Option
pursuant to _Section 2.8(j)_.

 



-17-  The payment of the Per Share Option Consideration to each holder of a Vested
Company Option as described in this _Section 2.7(a) _shall be reduced by any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are withheld
pursuant to the preceding sentence and remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Vested Company
Option.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option shall be assumed by
Parent (each such assumed Unvested Company Option, an "Assumed Company
Option"). Each Unvested Company Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Company Plan under which it was granted and any
option agreement between the Company and the optionee with regard to the
Assumed Company Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that (i) each Assumed Company Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Assumed Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ the Exchange Ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Assumed Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by _dividing_ the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Assumed Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, with the resulting exercise price
per share rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is intended that Assumed
Company Options assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time
as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
the Assumed Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this _Section 2.7(b)_ shall
be applied consistent with such intent. The conversion and assumption of the
Assumed Company Options is intended to comply with the regulations and other
binding guidance under Section 409A, including Treas. Reg.
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D), and such converted options to purchase Parent Common
Stock shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedule, expiration date, exercise provisions and transfer restrictions) as
were applicable to the corresponding Assumed Company Options immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions reasonably
necessary to effect the transactions anticipated by this  _Section 2.7_
under the Company Plans and all Company Option agreements and any other plan
or arrangement of the Company (whether written or oral, formal or informal).

 

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in no
event more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form
that Parent is eligible to use) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Assumed Company Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so long as the
Assumed Company Options remain outstanding.

 



-18-  (e) No Company Warrants will be assumed by Parent. Each Vested Company Warrant
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company
or the holder thereof, be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to:

(i) at Closing, the Per Share Closing Warrant Consideration (to be paid in
accordance with _Section 2.9_);

(ii) upon release from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms and conditions
of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, the applicable Per Share Escrow
Amount, _less_ the proportionate amount of any amounts properly paid in
satisfaction of, or properly subject to pending, claims for Losses made
in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement;

(iii) upon release from the Representative Reimbursement Fund pursuant to the
terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow Agreement, the
applicable Per Share Representative Reimbursement Amount, _less_ the
proportionate amount of any Representative Expenses properly paid or pending
in accordance with the terms and conditions of _Article VIII_ and the Escrow
Agreement; and

(iv) the amount, if any, payable with respect to such Vested Company Warrant
pursuant to _Section 2.8(j)_.

(f) Each Unvested Company Warrant outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be
paid with respect thereto.

 

2.8 _Adjustments_.

(a) The Company shall deliver to Parent at least three (3) business days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date a statement detailing the Companys good faith
best estimate of the Transaction Costs (the "Estimated Transaction Costs
Amount") and the Company Net Debt (the "Estimated Company Net Debt"), each as
of the close of business on the Closing Date and/or the Material Condition
Satisfaction Date, as relevant (such statement, the "Estimated Closing
Statement"). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared by the Company
in accordance with GAAP (as consistently applied by the Company). Parent shall
have an opportunity to review such Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and
Estimated Company Net Debt. If Parent disputes the Estimated Transaction Costs
Amount or Estimated Company Net Debt, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
in good faith to agree upon the amount of the Estimated Transaction Costs
Amount and Estimated Company Net Debt. If Parent and the Company are unable to
agree upon the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and Estimated Company Net
Debt, then the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and Estimated Company Net
Debt as determined by Parent shall be deemed to be the Transaction Costs
Amount and Company Net Debt for the purpose of calculating the Merger
Consideration payable and issuable at the Closing. The Estimated Transaction
Costs Amount and the Estimated

 



-19-   Company Net Debt shall be deemed to be the Transaction Costs and Company Net
Debt, respectively, for purposes of calculating the Merger Consideration
payable and issuable at the Closing. 

(b) If the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and Estimated Company Net Debt
as determined by Parent are used to calculate the Merger Consideration
payable and issuable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_, then the
Securityholders Representative and his, her or its representatives shall be
given all such access as they may reasonably require during Parents normal
business hours (or such other times as the parties may agree) to those books
and records of the Company and the Surviving Corporation in the possession of,
and/or under the control of, Parent, and access to such personnel or
representatives of the Company and Parent, in each case, as they may
reasonably require for the purposes of reviewing and evaluating Parents
calculations of the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and Estimated Company
Net Debt.

 

(c) Within twenty (20) business days after the Closing Date, Parent or the
Securityholders Representative, at such partys option, may prepare in good
faith and deliver to the other party an updated statement of the Transaction
Costs and Company Net Debt, each as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and/or the Material Condition Satisfaction Date, as relevant (such
statement, the "Closing Statement") prepared in accordance with GAAP (as
consistently applied by the Company). To the extent no Closing Statement is
delivered within such time period, the Estimated Transaction Costs Amount and
Estimated Company Net Debt as used to calculate the Merger Consideration
payable and issuable at the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ shall be
final and binding on the parties to this Agreement.

 

(d) Following any delivery by Parent of a Closing Statement in accordance with
_Section 2.8(b)_, the Securityholders Representative and his, her or its
representatives shall be given all such access as they may reasonably require
during Parents normal business hours (or such other times as the parties may
agree) to those books and records of the Company and the Surviving
Corporation in the possession of, and/or under the control of, Parent, and
access to such personnel or representatives of the Company and Parent, in each
case, as they may reasonably require for the purposes of reviewing the
Closing Statement and Parents calculation of the Transaction Costs and
Company Net Debt.

(e) The Securityholders Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall have
twenty (20) business days following the date of delivery of the Closing
Statement to provide the other party with a written certificate confirming
that the calculation of the Transaction Costs and Company Net Debt as set
forth in the Closing Statement are correct (the "Confirmation Certificate") or
notifying the other party in writing of any good faith objections to specific
components of the calculation of the Transaction Costs or Company Net Debt as
set forth on the Closing Statement (a "Closing Statement Dispute Notice"),
which Closing Statement Dispute Notice shall specify the nature and dollar
amount of any disagreement, the basis for such belief and the partys
proposed calculation of the Transaction Costs and/or the Company Net Debt
(collectively, the "Disputed Items"). Only those matters specified in the
Closing Statement Dispute Notice shall be deemed to be disputed, and all
other matters included in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final
and binding on the parties to this Agreement. If a Confirmation Certificate is
delivered by or on behalf of the Securityholders Representative or Parent,
as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 2.8(e)_, the Transaction Costs and
Company Net

 



-20-   Debt as set forth in the Closing Statement shall be deemed to be final and
binding on the parties to this Agreement.

(f) If the Securityholders Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall
send a timely Closing Statement Dispute Notice in accordance with _Section
2.8(e)_, during the ten (10) days following the receipt of the Closing
Statement Dispute Notice or such longer period as Parent and the
Securityholders Representative mutually agree (collectively, the
"Consultation Period"), a representative of Parent, on the one hand, and the
Securityholders Representative, on the other hand, shall negotiate with one
another and attempt in good faith to resolve any Disputed Items. Any Disputed
Item so resolved by Parent and the Securityholders Representative will be
reduced to writing and deemed final, conclusive as to the resolved Disputed
Items and binding on the parties to this Agreement.

(g) If Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall have not resolved
all Disputed Items within the Consultation Period, Parent and the
Securityholders Representative (either together or separately) shall be
entitled to submit all unresolved Disputed Items to the Independent Auditor to
review and resolve such matters (collectively, the "Unresolved Items"). Each
of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, and representatives to, provide full
cooperation to the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor will resolve
each Unresolved Item; _provided_ , that the amount of any Unresolved Item may
not be more favorable to Parent than the related amount reflected in the
Closing Statement or Closing Statement Dispute Notice, as applicable, nor more
favorable to the Securityholders Representative than the related amount set
forth in the Closing Statement or Closing Statement Dispute Notice, as
applicable. The Independent Auditor shall (i) act in its capacity as an expert
and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only those matters as to which there
is a dispute between the parties and (iii) be instructed to reach its
conclusions regarding any such dispute, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
and in any case no more than thirty (30) days after its appointment and
provide a written explanation of its decision. In the event that Parent and
the Securityholders Representative shall submit any Unresolved Item to the
Independent Auditor, each such party may submit a "position paper" to the
Independent Auditor setting forth the position of such party with respect to
such Unresolved Item, to be considered by such Independent Auditor as it deems
fit. Subject to the foregoing, the Independent Auditor may conduct such
proceedings as the Independent Auditor believes, in its sole discretion, are
appropriate in determining the Unresolved Items; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, unless Parent and the Securityholders Representative otherwise agree,
all material communications between Parent or the Securityholders
Representative or any of their respective representatives, on the one hand,
and the Independent Auditor, on the other hand, will be in writing with copies
simultaneously delivered to either the Securityholders Representative or
Parent (whichever was not the sender or recipient of such material
communications). The dispute resolution procedure set forth in this _Section
2.8_ shall be the exclusive dispute resolution mechanic for determining
any Disputed Item hereunder, including, without limitation, any Disputed Item
concerning whether the calculation of the Transaction Costs or Company Net
Debt was prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the indemnifications provisions
set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof shall not apply to any such dispute. All
fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Auditor shall
be paid by Parent and the Securityholders Representative (solely on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties and in its capacity as the Securityholders
Representative, not in its individual capacity) in proportion to each partys

 



-21-   initial position relative to the Independent Auditors final determination
or in such other proportions as the Independent Auditor determines to be
appropriate having regard to the respective merits of the parties positions,
which proportion, in each case, shall be included in such final determination.

(h) If the Securityholders Representative or Parent, as applicable, does not
deliver a Closing Statement Dispute Notice in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section 2.8(e)_ above, the Closing Statement (together with
the calculation of the Transaction Costs and Company Net Debt included
therein) shall be deemed to have been finally determined and accepted by all
of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that the Securityholders
Representative or Parent, as applicable, delivers a Closing Statement Dispute
Notice in accordance with the provisions above and Parent and the
Securityholders Representative are able to resolve such dispute by
mutual agreement, the Closing Statement, together with the calculation of the
Transaction Costs and Company Net Debt, to the extent modified by the mutual
agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to have been finally determined and
accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that the
Securityholders Representative or Parent, as applicable, delivers a Closing
Statement Dispute Notice in accordance with the provisions set forth above and
Parent and the Securityholders Representative are unable to resolve such
dispute by mutual agreement, the determination of the Independent Auditor
shall be final and binding on the parties to this Agreement, and the
calculation of the Transaction Costs and Company Net Debt, to the extent
modified by the Independent Auditor, shall be deemed to have been finally
determined and accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. The
Transaction Costs and Company Net Debt as finally determined pursuant to
this  _Section 2.8_ shall be referred to herein as the "Final Transaction
Costs Amount" and the "Final Company Net Debt," respectively.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Adjustment Amount" means the sum of the (A) Transaction Costs Adjustment
plus (B) the Debt Adjustment;

(ii) "Transaction Costs Adjustment," which may be positive or negative, means
(A) the Final Transaction Costs Amount _minus_ (B) the Estimated Transaction
Costs Amount.

(iii) "Debt Adjustment," which may be positive or negative, means (A) the
Final Company Net Debt _minus_ (B) the Estimated Company Net Debt.

 

(j) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, Parent shall promptly (but
in no event more than three (3) business days following the determination of
the Final Transaction Costs Amount and Final Company Net Debt) deliver to the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash equal to the Adjustment Amount for payment to
the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portions in accordance with _Section 2.9_. If the Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to promptly (but in no event more than three (3) business
days following the determination of the Final Transaction Costs Amount and
Final Company Net

 



-22-   Debt) release from the Escrow Fund and deliver to Parent an amount in cash
equal to the Adjustment Amount.

2.9 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select its transfer agent or another
nationally recognized exchange agent to act as the exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in the Merger, which agent shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company.

 

(b) _Payments_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with the Exchange Agent (the "Exchange Agent Agreement") which
shall provide that, at or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this _Article
II_, the Merger Consideration, _less_ (i) the Escrow Amount, (ii) the
Representative Reimbursement Amount and (iii) the Pre-Closing Aggregate
Exercise Amount (which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Parent shall not be responsible for providing to the Exchange Agent,
but instead which amounts the Company shall make available to the Exchange
Agent immediately prior to the Effective Time) in exchange for Company Capital
Stock, Vested Company Options and Vested Company Warrants; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (x) notwithstanding the foregoing, Parents obligation to
make available the Merger Consideration as adjusted above is conditioned upon
the Companys obligation to make available the Pre-Closing Aggregate
Exercise Amount and (y) the Company shall provide to Parent one (1) business
day prior to the Closing Date a statement setting forth the calculation of the
Pre-Closing Aggregate Exercise Amount. The portion of each of the Escrow Fund
and the Representative Reimbursement Amount contributed following the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement
with respect to each Indemnifying Party shall be equal to the Pro Rata Portion
of the Escrow Fund and the Representative Reimbursement Amount of such
Indemnifying Party. The Exchange Agent shall cause such portion of the Merger
Consideration (x) to be held for the benefit of holders of Company Capital
Stock, Vested Company Options and Vested Company Warrants and (y) to be
applied promptly to making the payments of the Per Share Closing Merger
Consideration, Per Share Closing Option Consideration and Per Share Closing
Warrant Consideration, as the case may be, to such holders. Any cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

(c)  _Exchange Procedures_. Within two (2) business days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or
certificates or an instrument or instruments (the "Certificates"), which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented (i) outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration as set forth herein, (ii) the Vested
Company Options which were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Option Consideration as set forth herein and (iii) the Vested Company Warrants
which were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Warrant
Consideration as set forth herein: (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
cash constituting the Per

 



-23-   Share Closing Merger Consideration, the Per Share Closing Option
Consideration and the Per Share Closing Warrant Consideration; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall rely upon, information provided by the Company regarding
Vested Company Options, and shall not require holders of Vested Company
Options to surrender any Certificates related thereto or complete or return
a letter of transmittal as a condition to receipt of the appropriate portion
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent (if required), together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of record of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the amount of cash constituting the Per Share Closing
Merger Consideration, Per Share Closing Option Consideration or Per Share
Closing Warrant Consideration to which such holder is entitled hereunder as
specified on the Spreadsheet and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. At the election of any Company Securityholder who is
to receive in excess of $100,000 in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Exchange Agent shall make any payment of Merger
Consideration to such Company Securityholder by wire transfer. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, Per Share Option Consideration or Per
Share Warrant Consideration into which such securities shall have been so
converted.

(d)  _Required Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Company Securityholder or former Company Securityholder such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under
any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, the
amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.9_, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a Company Securityholder for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
Company Securityholders pursuant to this _Article II_. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company
Securityholders pursuant to this _Article II_ shall promptly be paid to
Parent.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains in the Exchange Fund undistributed to the former Company
Securityholders twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the
request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation. Any former Company Securityholder who has not theretofore
complied with this

 



-24-    _Section 2.9_ shall thereafter only look to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal
Requirements) as general creditors thereof for any portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Capital Stock,
Vested Company Option or Vested Company Warrant such Person held, as
determined pursuant to this _Article II_, without any interest thereon. If
any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity, any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed
by former Company Securityholders immediately prior to such time shall, to
the extent permitted by law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

2.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock, Options or
Warrants_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock, Vested Company Options and Vested Company Warrants in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock,
Vested Company Options and Vested Company Warrants, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Capital Stock, Vested Company Options and Vested Company
Warrants which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Options and Company Warrants formerly represented thereby, except as
otherwise provided for herein (including the right to receive the Merger
Consideration), in the Escrow Agreement or by applicable Legal Requirement.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article II_.

2.11  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall transfer
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount of cash
constituting the portion of the Merger Consideration payable to such holder
pursuant to this _Article II_ with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Exchange Agent, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance thereof, require the Person who is the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide an indemnification agreement in a
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Exchange Agent, Parent or
Surviving Corporation or to post a bond in such amount as is reasonably
sufficient to provide a full indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to the Certificate(s) alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.12 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (B) as

notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or impair the
Companys rights or alter the rights or obligations of any Person under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or

disapprove or object to the proposed indirect acquisition of control by Parent

Texas Department of Insurance in connection with the Merger without Parents
receipt from the Texas Department of Insurance of its notice of such denial,
disapproval or objection (the "Texas DOI Approval") and (v) such consents,

additional Taxes. No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental
Entity that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to Tax in a
jurisdiction in which it does not file Tax Returns. Since July 1, 2009, and to
the Knowledge of the Company for periods prior to such date, neither the

applicable, prosecute and maintain each item of Company Registered
Intellectual Property have been paid or filed with the relevant Governmental
Entities.

 

(b) _Validity_. To the Knowledge of the Company, all Company Registered
Intellectual Property, other than applications, is valid and enforceable and
all issuance, renewal, maintenance and other payments that are or have become
due with respect thereto have been timely paid by or on behalf of the Company.
To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or information, including
information or facts that would constitute prior art, that would render any of
the Company Registered Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable, or
would affect any pending application for any Company Registered Intellectual
Property. 

(c) _Company Trade Secrets_. _Section 3.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter describes, as of the date of this Agreement, all of the material
proprietary technology owned by the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

 



-33-  (d) _Ownership_. The Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is the sole and
exclusive owner of the Company Intellectual Property free and clear of Liens
(except Permitted Liens). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received a written notice from any third party pursuant to which such third
party claims to own any Company Intellectual Property. The Company or its
Subsidiaries may transfer each material item of Company Registered
Intellectual Property without restriction or payment to a third party. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are obligated to transfer the
ownership of any material item of Company Intellectual Property to a third
party. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company Intellectual Property and
any Intellectual Property licensed to the Company or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the Scheduled Inbound Licenses constitute all Intellectual
Property necessary to conduct the Companys and its Subsidiaries business in
all material respects in the manner currently conducted and currently
contemplated by the Company and the Subsidiaries to be conducted in the
future. The representation set forth in this _Section 3.8(d)_ does not
constitute, and shall not be construed as, a representation regarding non-
infringement of third party Intellectual Property Rights.

(e) _Confidential Information_. The Company and its Subsidiaries take
reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy and protect the proprietary nature
of the trade secrets and confidential information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including, in the ordinary course, entering into confidentiality
agreements requiring third parties to take reasonable measures to keep such
trade secrets confidential. Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries have received written notice alleging improper use or disclosure
of, or a breach in the security of, the confidential information of any third
party provided to Company or its Subsidiaries under a written obligation of
confidentiality. To the knowledge of the Company, there has been no: (i)
unauthorized disclosure of any material third party proprietary or
confidential information provided to Company or its Subsidiaries under a
written obligation of confidentiality and in the possession, custody or
control of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) breach of the
Companys or any Subsidiarys security procedures wherein such material
confidential information of third parties has been disclosed in an
unauthorized manner to a third party. The Company and its Subsidiaries take,
and have consistently taken during the three (3) years preceding the Closing,
commercially reasonable measures to actively police the quality of all goods
and services sold, distributed or marketed under each of its Trademarks and
has taken commercially reasonable measures to ensure that no Trademarks that
it has licensed to others shall be deemed to be abandoned.

(f) _Infringement by Company_. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
operation of the business of the Company nor its Subsidiaries as it is
currently conducted infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the
Intellectual Property Rights of a third Person except where such infringement,
misappropriation, or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. As of the date hereof, the Company has not received written
notice of a claim that such operation infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise
violates the Intellectual Property Rights of a third Person (nor does
the Company have Knowledge of any basis therefor).

(g) _Infringement of Company Intellectual Property_. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no third party is infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise
violating the Company

 



-34-   Intellectual Property in a manner that, individually or in the aggregate, is
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available
to Parent all written notices issued by the Company concerning the
infringement, violation or misappropriation of any Company Intellectual
Property.

(h)  _Proprietary Information Agreements_. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have and generally enforce a policy requiring each Employee and individual

Subsidiary all right, title and interest in any inventions and works of
authorship, whether or not patentable, that are invented, created, developed,
conceived and/or reduced to practice during the term of such Employees
employment or such independent contractors work for the Company or the
relevant Subsidiary, and all Intellectual Property Rights therein, and
waiving their moral rights therein to the extent legally permissible.

breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or impair the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries rights or alter the rights or obligations of any Person
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
Company IP Contract.

 

(v) To the Knowledge of the Company, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will be permitted to exercise all of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries rights under all Company IP Contracts to the same extent the

occurred and without being required to pay any material additional amounts or
consideration other than fees, royalties or payments which the Company or its
Subsidiaries would otherwise be required to pay had the Merger not occurred.

any manner that would or could, with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property, (i) require its disclosure or distribution in source code form,

3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Schedule_. _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a list, as of the date hereof, of each material Company Employee Plan and each
material Employee Agreement. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
any commitment to establish any new material Company Employee Plan or material
Employee Agreement, to materially modify any Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement (except to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements or
to conform any such Company Employee Plan or Employee

 



-37-   Agreement to any Legal Requirements or as required by this Agreement), or to
adopt or enter into any Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement.

 

(b) _Documents_. The Company has made available to Parent, as of the date
hereof, correct and complete copies of: (i) all documents embodying each
Company Employee Plan and each Employee Agreement including (without
limitation) all amendments thereto and all related trust documents,

contracts, and policies pertaining to fiduciary liability insurance covering
the fiduciaries for each Company Employee Plan; (ii) the most recent annual
actuarial valuations, if any, prepared for each Company Employee Plan; (iii)
the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form Series 5500 and all schedules
and financial statements attached thereto), if any, required under ERISA or
the Code in connection with each Company Employee Plan; (iv) if the Company
Employee Plan is funded, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of
Company Employee Plan assets; (v) the most recent summary plan description
together with the summary(ies) of material modifications thereto, if any,
required under ERISA with respect to each Company Employee Plan; (vi) all IRS
determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters; and (vii) the three
(3) most recent plan years discrimination tests for each Company Employee Plan
for which such test is required. 

(c) _Benefit Plan Compliance_. In all material respects, each Company Employee
Plan has been established and maintained in accordance with its terms and in
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including but not limited
to ERISA or the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under Section
501(a) of the Code has either applied for, prior to the expiration of the
requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements,
or obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination. For each Company Employee Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, to the
Companys Knowledge, there has been no event, condition or circumstance that
has adversely affected or is reasonably likely to adversely affect such
qualified status. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Company Employee
Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability. As
of the date hereof, there are no material current actions, suits or claims
pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably
anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against any Company
Employee Plan or against the assets of any Company Employee Plan that would
reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the date hereof, there are no material
audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened by any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Employee
Plan. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or

Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code that would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to the Company.

 



-38-  (d) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, any (i) Pension Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code; (ii) Multiemployer Plan; (iii) "multiple employer plan" as
defined in ERISA or the Code; or (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan provides health
benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract. 

(e) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan or Employee
Agreement provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide post-
termination or retiree health insurance or life insurance benefits to any
person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(f) _Effect of Transaction_. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Company Employee Plan or Employee Agreement that will or may
result in any material payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), forgiveness of Indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Employee. No
payment or benefit which will or may be made by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any Employee could reasonably be expected to be characterized
as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to gross-up
or otherwise reimburse any Employee for any excise tax incurred by such
person pursuant to which it is bound to compensate any Employee for excise
taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

(g) _Section 409A_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary: (i) each
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that is subject to Section 409A was operated
between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 in good faith compliance with
Section 409A and (ii) since January 1, 2009, each such nonqualified deferred
compensation plan has been in documentary and operational compliance with
Section 409A. There is no Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, which individually or
collectively could require the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay a Tax
gross-up payment to any Employee for Tax-related payments under Section 409A.

 

(h) _Employment Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
in conflict with, or in default or in violation of, any applicable foreign,
federal, state and local laws, and collective bargaining agreements and
arrangements respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions
of employment, Tax withholding, prohibited discrimination, equal
employment, fair employment practices, immigration status, employee safety
and health, and wages and hours, except for those conflicts, defaults or
violations that, in each case or the aggregate, would not be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(i) _Labor_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries are a party to
any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to
employees of the Company or

 



-39-   its Subsidiaries and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike
or work stoppage against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated which
may materially interfere with the respective business activities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
representatives or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries has committed
any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of the respective
businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which would reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the date hereof, there are no actions,
suits, claims, or proceedings pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, relating to any
labor, safety or discrimination matters involving any employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, charges of unfair labor
practices or discrimination complaints which reasonably would be expected,
either individually or in the aggregate with all such actions, suits, claims
or proceedings to result in a material liability to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.13 _Real Property_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
real property. _Section 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the real property currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"). There is
not, under any leases, lease guaranties, subleases, agreements for the
leasing, use or occupancy of the Leased Real Property, including all
amendments, terminations and modifications thereof (the "Leases"), any default
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, by any other party thereto, and the tenant thereunder has not
received any written notice of a breach, default, cancellation or termination
of any such Lease, except in each case as reasonably would not be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available, to the
extent available to the Company, a true, complete and correct executed copy of
each Lease, each amendment thereto and any ancillary documentation pertaining
thereto to Parent. Each Lease is in full force and effect and represents the
entire agreement between the landlord and tenant with respect to such
property, and upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder shall not constitute a breach of any Lease or otherwise provide the
landlord a right to terminate such Lease. There are no subleases with respect
to the space demised under each Lease, and no tenant under any of such
Leases has assigned any of its interest in such Lease to a third party. To
the Companys Knowledge, no Leased Real Property is currently scheduled to be
condemned, requisitioned or otherwise taken by any public authority.

 

3.14 _Assets_. With respect to the material machinery, equipment, furniture,
fixtures and other tangible property and assets ("Assets") purported to be
owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
or its Subsidiaries have good and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold
in, or right to use, all of such assets free and clear of all Liens, except
Permitted Liens, and such assets are in operating condition (normal wear and
tear excepted). For purposes of clarity, this _Section 3.14_ does not relate
to real property (such items being the subject of  _Section 3.13_) or
Intellectual Property Rights (such items being solely the subject of _Section
3.8_). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries operate or have any
operations, conduct any business or hold any Assets, directly or indirectly,
in any country outside of the United States.

 



-40-  3.15 _Environmental Matters_. Except as, individually or in the aggregate,

promulgated by any Governmental Entity which prohibit, regulate, or control
any Hazardous Material ("Environmental Laws"); (ii) the Company has not

Subsidiaries has received written notice from a Governmental Entity since July
1, 2009 stating that it is subject to any unresolved enforcement action under
any applicable Environmental Laws and (iv) there is no action or proceeding
pending or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, against the Company
alleging the Companys failure to comply with Environmental Laws. The Parties
agree that the only representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement which relate to Environmental Laws or a Hazardous Material are those
contained in this _Section 3.15_.

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its and its
Subsidiaries Employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (including
any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) to directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to, or the
making, submission or announcement of, any offer or proposal for an
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiry, proposal or offer
which it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information
with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
which it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii)
engage in discussions with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or any inquiry, proposal

 



-52-   or offer which it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
except to inform such Person of the existence of these provisions; (iv)
approve, endorse, recommend, agree to or consummate any Acquisition Proposal;
(v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any contract,
agreement or commitment contemplating any Acquisition Proposal or transaction
contemplated thereby or (vi) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or
permit any Representative, to do any of the foregoing. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all existing activities, (i)
related to its proposed initial public offering, including the filing of any
additional forms, reports or other documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), responding to SEC comments and participating in road show
presentations, unless required by applicable Legal Requirement or pursuant to
written consent of Parent and (ii) discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
shall promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed
a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of
acquiring the stock or assets (whether by merger, acquisition of stock or
assets or otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to return (or,
if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if
requested by Parent, to enforce such Persons obligation to do so. Neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall waive, amend or grant a release under
any confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 10%
or more of the net revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole, or 10% or more of the aggregate
equity interests of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 10% or more of the
aggregate equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the acquisition of 10% or more of
the aggregate equity interests or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other transaction the consummation of which would be
reasonably likely to impede, interfere with, prevent the Merger, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(b) _Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_. As promptly as
practicable after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (but in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt thereof) or any request for nonpublic information
or inquiry, offer or proposal which it reasonably believes could lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, request, offer or inquiry,
which notice shall include (i) a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal and
any other documents provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) in respect of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiry relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to an Acquisition Proposal not made in writing, a written
summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request.

 

6.2 _Stockholder Approval_. The Companys Board of Directors shall submit this
Agreement for adoption by the stockholders of the Company and recommend that
the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best

 



-53-   efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval within twelve (12) hours
following the execution of this Agreement in compliance with applicable Legal
Requirements. After the Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company
shall send, pursuant to Sections 228 and 262(d) of the DGCL, a written notice
to all stockholders of the Company that did not execute the written consent
under which the Stockholder Approval was obtained informing them that this
Agreement was adopted and that appraisal rights are available for their
Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (which notice shall
include a copy of such Section 262).

 

6.3 _Section 280G_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, (i) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain a waiver from each Person who, but for such waiver or the 280G Approval
referred to below, may receive a Section 280G Payment (as defined below) (each
such person, a "280G Individual") substantially in the form set forth on
_Exhibit B_ (the "Executive Waiver Letter") and (ii) the Company shall submit
to the Company Stockholders for approval or disapproval, by such number of
Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code, payment and/or benefits that may, separately or in the aggregate,
constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of
the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to reasonable review by Parent), such that, if
approved, such Section 280G Payments shall not be deemed to be Section 280G
Payments, and prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent
evidence that a Company Stockholder vote was solicited in conformance with
Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and that (x) such
requisite 280G Approval was obtained with respect to any Section 280G Payment
(the "280G Approval"), or (y) that the 280G Approval was not obtained. If,
after the requisite Company stockholder vote is completed, the 280G Approval
is not obtained, such payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided
to the extent that, when paid, they would cause any amounts to constitute
Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those payments and/or
benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the Company
Stockholder vote.

6.4  _Confidentiality; Access to Information; No Modification of
Representations, Warranties or Covenants_.

(a)  _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent
have previously executed an amended and restated confidentiality agreement
dated April 30, 2012 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality
Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
and each of Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including
attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) to hold
any information obtained pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or the effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) _Access to Information_. During the period from the date hereof
and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms or the Effective Time, the Company will afford Parent
and Parents accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to its offices, properties, books, records,
Contracts, reports, financial data and personnel to obtain all information
concerning the

 



-54-   business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, properties, results of
operations and personnel, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent
that (i) any Legal Requirement applicable to the Company or its Subsidiaries
restricts or prohibits access to any such properties or information, or (ii)
such access would be in breach of any confidentiality obligation, commitment
or provision by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or
affected, which confidentiality obligation, commitment or provision shall be
disclosed to Parent; _provided_ , that disclosure of such
obligation, commitment or provision would not itself be the breach of an
obligation or commitment to a third Person. With respect to clauses (i) and
(ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of any
necessary third party to provide such access or disclosure, (B) with respect
to information that is subject to an attorney/client or attorney work product
privilege, enter into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement, as
appropriate, so as to allow for disclosure in a manner that does not result in
the loss of such privilege or (C) develop an alternative to providing such
information so as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to
Parent. With respect to the exchange of competitively sensitive information,
including strategic and marketing plans, pricing material and customer
specific data, outside antitrust counsel will be consulted prior to
the exchange of such information, and such information shall not be exchanged
to the extent such counsel advises against such exchange. In addition, any
information obtained from the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 6.4(b)_ shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Any access to the Leased Real
Property shall be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of the
applicable Lease and shall not include the right to perform any invasive
testing or Phase II environmental site assessment.

(c) _Interim Financial Information_. As promptly as practicable after the end
of each 14-day period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
Company shall furnish to Parent a statement of the Companys current assets
and current liabilities prepared in good faith and based on the Companys
internal management reports. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare such statements in accordance with GAAP (as consistently
applied by the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent agrees and
accepts that such statements may not be so compliant in all respects. In
addition, as promptly as practicable after the end of each 14-day period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company shall furnish
to Parent a statement of Company Options exercised during such period, which
statement shall include the number of options exercised, the number of shares
issued and the aggregate exercise price paid.

 

(d) _No Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or access pursuant to
this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto under this
Agreement.

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company will consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and
concur with, and agree on any press release or public statement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger and any Acquisition Proposal and will not issue any such press release
or make any such

 



-55-   public statement prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be
required by applicable Legal Requirement or the applicable rules or
regulations of any stock exchange. The parties have agreed to the text of the
joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.

6.6 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) _Regulatory Filings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action
that would impede compliance with, all Legal Requirements applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and prior to the date hereof, or on the
date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall have made or
shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications or submissions of other
documents required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, (i)
Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (ii) any other filing necessary to
obtain any Necessary Consent, (iii) filings under any other comparable pre-
merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws
of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto, and (iv) any
filings required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, any applicable state or securities or "blue
sky" laws and the securities laws of any foreign country, or any other Legal
Requirement relating to the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company has caused
or will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with any
Governmental Entity under this _Section 6.6(a)_ to comply in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements.

 

(b) _Exchange of Information_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
continue to promptly supply the other with any information which may be
required in order to effectuate any filings or applications pursuant to
_Section 6.6(a)_. Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements
relating to the exchange of information, and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) consult
with the other prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing,
(ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith, the views of the other in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions and
proposals before making or submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including under
any antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement), (iii) coordinate with the
other in preparing and exchanging such information and (iv) promptly provide
the other (and its counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. It is acknowledged and agreed that the parties hereto
shall have, except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, joint
responsibility for determining the strategy for dealing with the FTC, DOJ or
any other Governmental Entity with responsibility for reviewing the Merger
with respect to antitrust or competition issues.

 



-56-  (c) _Notification_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the
other promptly upon the receipt of (i) any comments from any officials of any
Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made pursuant hereto and
(ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity for amendments or
supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information provided to
comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements. Whenever any
event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
any filing made pursuant to  _Section 6.6(a)_, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence
and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment
or supplement.

 

(d) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective,
in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and
the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities,
if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid
any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental
Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all Necessary Consents, and (iv) the execution
or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Company be required to (i) hold separate or to divest any of its businesses,
products or assets, or of any of its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) take
or agree to take any other action or agree to any other limitation or
restriction that would be materially adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries or
that would materially impair the overall benefits expected to be realized
from the Merger.

6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) _Service Credit; Eligibility; Compensation and Benefits_. Following the
Effective Time and for the two (2) year period thereafter, Parent shall
arrange for each participant in the Company Employee Plans (including all
dependents) (the "Company Participants") who becomes and remains an employee
of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation (or a dependent
or beneficiary of such employee) to be eligible for employee benefits
substantially similar in the aggregate to those in effect with respect to such
Company Participants immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (other
than equity based benefits, change in control benefits and individual
employment agreements); _provided_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent
or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company
Participant to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will be deemed to have satisfied the
requirements of the prior sentence by maintaining or causing the Surviving
Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all of the
assets and businesses of the Surviving Corporation, its successors and
assigns) to maintain the Company employee benefit plans or

 



-57-   arrangements at benefit levels that in the aggregate are no less than the
Company Employee Plans in effect on the date of this Agreement. Base
compensation and target bonus opportunity shall not be decreased for the
period from the Effective Time through June 30, 2013 for any individuals who
are employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
(each, a "Continuing Employee") and remain employed by Parent or its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ that the
foregoing shall not apply to any Continuing Employee who has an individually
negotiated agreement with Parent. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) on and after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Company to, take the actions set forth in _Section 6.7(a)(i)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) if, on or prior to the Closing, the
Company has not paid incentive and bonus amounts under the Incentive Plans in
respect of the Companys fiscal year 2012 (including annual bonuses for fiscal
2012), Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay, on or prior to July
31, 2012 full annual target bonuses, to the extent earned, under the
Companys 2012 corporate incentive compensation plan, executive incentive
compensation plan and/or other Company annual bonus arrangements, and all
incentive and bonus amounts under the Companys other Incentive Plans, if and
when due, in respect of the Companys fiscal year 2012 in accordance with such
Incentive Plans, in each case, as determined in good faith in a manner
consistent with the Companys past practice and the terms of the applicable
Incentive Plan, _provided_ such bonuses are accrued or paid in the ordinary
course of business. Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for
all purposes, including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, levels of benefits under Parents
severance plan and vacation policy) and eligibility for vesting under Parent
employee benefit plans and arrangements with respect to his or her length
of service with the Company (and its subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to
the Closing Date, provided, that the foregoing shall not result in the
duplication of benefits or to benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension
plan. Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at
work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any Parent employee benefit plans and
arrangements to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees, shall provide
them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar
payments) made under a benefit plan of the Company during the plan year which
includes the Closing Date for the purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any
corresponding Parent employee benefit plans or arrangements in which they are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date and shall credit the accounts
of such Continuing Employees under any Parent employee benefit plan which is
a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Company employee benefit plan. In
addition, Parent agrees to the further agreements set forth in _Section
6.7(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) Nothing in this _Section 6.7_ shall be construed to limit the right of
Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any Company or Parent employee benefit plan or any other employee
benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is permitted by the
terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this _Section 6.7_ be
construed to require the Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation to retain the employment of any particular Continuing
Employee for any fixed period of time following the Effective Time.

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.4_, the provisions of
this _Section 6.7_ are solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and no
current or former employee,

 



-58-   director or independent contractor or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
Company Employee Plan, Employee Agreement or any other employee benefit plan
for any purpose.

 

6.8 _Indemnification_.

(a) For the period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement (the "Company Indemnified Liabilities") of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by reason
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Indemnified Proceedings"), whether
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after the Effective
Time and all Company Indemnified Liabilities based on, or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts
arose from or are related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby), in each case, on terms no less favorable than the indemnification
afforded to the directors and officers of the Company as of the Effective
Time. Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 6.8(a)_ upon becoming aware of any such Company Indemnified
Proceeding shall promptly notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation (but the
failure to so notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from any liability it may have under this
_Section 6.8(a)_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
Parent or the Surviving Corporation), and shall deliver to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation the undertaking contemplated by Section 145 of the DGCL.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification
agreements between the Company and the Company Indemnified Parties or other
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, subject to applicable Legal
Requirements. For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at
least as favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties as those contained in
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on
the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
Company Indemnified Parties.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the Company Indemnified
Parties, in effect for six (6) years after the Effective Time insurance "tail"
or other insurance policies with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
coverage applicable to directors and officers of the Company as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ , 

 



-59-    _however_ , that if such "tail" or other policies are not available at an
annual cost not greater than 200% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date hereof under such policy (the "Insurance Cap"), then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be obtained as much comparable insurance as can
reasonably be obtained in its good faith judgment at a cost up to but not
exceeding the Insurance Cap. 

(d) This _Section 6.8_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Company Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and its successors and assigns.

6.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, timely prepare and file with the relevant Governmental Entity
all Tax Returns of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company
Group, the due date for filing of which, determined taking into
account extensions, is after the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Tax Returns that reflect a deduction, loss or other Tax benefit
attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Parent
Tax Returns"). The Company shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, timely
prepare and file with the relevant Governmental Entity all Tax Returns of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Company Group, the due date for
filing of which, determined taking into account extensions, is on or before
the Closing Date ("Company Tax Returns"); _provided_ that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall furnish Parent with a copy of any such Tax Return that is
an income Tax Return at least sixty (60) days before such Tax Return is due
and with a copy of any such Tax Return that is not an income Tax Return at
least five (5) days before such Tax Return is due (except for payroll Tax
Returns, copies of which shall not be provided to Parent). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to any Company Tax Return (other than a payroll
Tax Return) due less than sixty (60) days or less than five (5) days, as
applicable, after the date hereof, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such Company Tax Return to Parent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later than
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of any such Company Tax Return that
is an income Tax Return. No such Company Tax Returns required to be provided
to Parent in accordance with this Section 6.9(a) shall be filed with any
Governmental Entity without Parents written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any Company Tax Returns
described in the preceding sentence shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with applicable law and the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and in a manner that does not distort taxable income ( _e.g._ , by deferring
income or accelerating deductions), unless otherwise required by law. All Tax
Returns for a taxable period including the Closing Date shall be filed on the
basis that the relevant taxable period ended as of the close of business on
the Closing Date, unless the relevant Governmental Entity will not accept such
a Tax Return. After any Tax Return is completed in accordance with this
_Section 6.9(a)_, the Parent shall timely pay (or cause to be timely paid)
to the relevant Governmental Entity all Taxes due in connection with the
filing of any Parent Tax Return, and the Company shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, timely pay to the relevant Governmental Entity all Taxes due
in connection with the filing of any Company Tax Return.

 



-60-  (b) _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent applicable, each party shall furnish to
the other party a copy of any Tax Return relating to, and receipt showing the
payment of, Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Company and its Subsidiaries, the
Securityholders Representative and the Indemnifying Parties, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, with respect to all Tax matters of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, including in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns and resolving all audits, investigations, proceedings or other
disputes with respect to Taxes. The parties shall maintain and make available
to each other all records reasonably necessary in connection with their
obligations under the preceding sentence.

(d) _Tax Contests_. Parent shall control all proceedings with respect to a
claim made by any Governmental Entity relating to Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax Claim") or any other period;
and, prior to the release of the Escrow Fund, the Securityholders
Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and at their expense
(which shall be paid out of the Representative Reimbursement Fund, or if that
is not available, the Escrow Fund), shall have the right to participate in the
prosecution, defense, settlement or any other matter with respect to a Tax
Claim, which shall not be settled without the prior written consent of the
Securityholders Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 

(e) _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

(f) _No Amended Tax Returns_. Prior to the release of the Escrow Fund, none of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
shall amend any previously filed Tax Return of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent
of the Securityholders Representative, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Securityholders Representative,
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall be permitted to amend
a previously filed Tax Return solely to carry back a net operating loss prior
to or after the release of the Escrow Fund.

6.10 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall deliver the Spreadsheet to Parent
at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date.

6.11 _Third Party Consents_. Parent acknowledges that certain consents and
waivers with respect to the Merger may be required from parties to Contracts
to which the Company is a party and that such consents and waivers have not
been obtained as of the date hereof. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any such consents and waivers; _provided_ that such cooperation shall
not include any requirement of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any
Company Securityholder, to expend money, commence, defend or participate in
any litigation, offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any third Person, or suffer the loss of any material 

 



-61-   right or benefit. Subject to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent
agrees that neither the Company and its Affiliates, nor the Company
Securityholders, shall have any liability whatsoever to Parent arising out of
or relating to the failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be
required in connection with the Merger or because of the termination of any
Contract as a result thereof. Subject to the second preceding sentence,
Parent further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the
Company contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and no
condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result of (a) the failure to
obtain any such consent or waiver, (b) any such termination or (c) any action
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such termination.

 

6.12 _Repayment of Company Debt_. At or prior to the Closing, if instructed by
Parent in writing, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary for the
repayment or prepayment of all of the Company Debt, including the obtaining of
duly executed payoff letters, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, from and ascertaining any applicable withholding Taxes to be withheld
(based on appropriate documentation, including IRS Forms W-9 and W-8BEN) and
making all appropriate arrangements for the prepayment or repayment thereof on
the Closing Date.

 

6.13 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all
of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the merger
with and into the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Between the date hereof and the
earlier of the Closing Date and the Material Condition Satisfaction Date, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) any written notice or other written
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of such party,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) any event that, individually or in the aggregate, with respect to
the Company, has, or is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect and with respect to Parent would prevent or materially impede
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (d) the
occurrence of any event that will result, or would reasonably be expected to
result, in the failure to satisfy a condition specified in _Article VII_
hereof, (e) to the actual knowledge of the individuals set forth on _Section
6.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, any event, condition, fact or
circumstance that caused or constitutes a material inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement, and (f) to
the Knowledge of the Company, any written notice received by such
party relating to any default under or breach of any Company Material
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall be deemed to cure any
breach by either party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement.

 



-62-  6.15 _Closing Balance Sheet_. The Company shall deliver to Parent at least
three (3) business days prior to the anticipated Material Condition
Satisfaction Date the Companys good faith best estimate of the Companys
consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statement of
operations and statement of cash flows as of the Closing Date, each of which
shall be prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP (as consistently
applied by the Company).

ARTICLE VIII

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES; COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS; ESCROW

8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. (a)
The Special Representations (as defined in _Section 8.3(a)_) and any
certificate or instrument required to be delivered pursuant hereto as it
relates thereto, shall survive the consummation of the Merger and continue
until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Special
Expiration Date"), after which time such representations and warranties shall
terminate and (b) all other representations and warranties of the Company
contained in this Agreement and any certificate or instrument required to be
delivered pursuant hereto as it relates thereto shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and continue until the Escrow Termination Date, after which time
such representations and warranties shall terminate. The covenants
and agreements which by their terms do not contemplate performance after the
Closing shall not survive the Closing. The covenants and agreements which by
their terms contemplate performance after the Closing Date shall survive the
Closing in accordance with their terms.

8.2 _Escrow and Representative Reimbursement Amount Deposit_.

 

(a) Promptly following the Closing, and without any act of any Company
Securityholder, Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agent.
For purposes of determining the reduction in the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to each Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section
2.6(a)_, _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(e)_, as applicable, Parent will
be deemed to have contributed with respect to each Indemnifying Party, his,
her or its Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Fund to be
governed under the terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that Parent, until such amounts are
distributed to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to _Section 8.5_ hereof, is
the owner of any cash in the Escrow Fund, and that all interest on or other
taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of such cash pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement ("Interest") shall be treated for tax
purposes as earned by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that upon 

 



-65-   any actual distributions of cash from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this
Article VIII, the pro rata portion of the Interest, if any, earned on and
relating thereto (less the pro rata portion of any Tax Distribution relating
to such Interest) shall be distributed with such cash. Parent shall be
entitled to a quarterly distribution of forty percent (40%) of such interest
or other taxable income (such distributed amounts, the "Tax Distribution
Amounts"). For the avoidance of doubt, none of the parties hereto will treat
any amounts in the Escrow Fund as subject to the imputed interest rules of
Section 1274 of the Code.

 

(b) Promptly following the Closing, and without any act of any Company
Securityholder, Parent shall deposit the Representative Reimbursement Amount
with the Securityholders Representative, to be held for the payment of
expenses incurred by the Securityholders Representative in performing its
duties pursuant to this Agreement (the "Representative Reimbursement Fund").
For purposes of determining the reduction in the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to each Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section
2.6(a)_, _Section 2.7(a)_ or _Section 2.7(e)_, as applicable, Parent will
be deemed to have contributed on behalf of each Indemnifying Party, his, her
or its Pro Rata Portion of the Representative Reimbursement Amount to the
Representative Reimbursement Fund to be governed under the terms set forth in
this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Representative Reimbursement Fund shall not be deemed part of the Escrow Fund
and shall not be available to satisfy any indemnification or other obligations
to Parent hereunder.

8.3 _Recovery From Escrow Fund; Indemnifying Parties_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and limitations contained in this _Section 8.3_ and
_Section 8.5_, the Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate each of the
Indemnified Parties for any Losses actually suffered or incurred by any
Indemnifying Party to the extent arising out of or resulting from (i) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Company
contained in this Agreement (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter) or
any certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.2_ of this Agreement, (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply
with any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement prior to the
Closing Date (as modified by the Company Disclosure Letter) and (iii) any
Adjustment Amount. Subject to _Section 8.5_, if and only to the extent
that the Escrow Fund has been fully paid out in satisfaction of any
indemnifiable Losses hereunder the Indemnifying Parties, severally and not
jointly, in accordance with each such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion,
shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party and Parent (on
behalf of itself and/or any other Indemnified Party) shall be permitted to
seek recourse against each Indemnifying Party, severally and not jointly, for
any Losses actually suffered or incurred by such Indemnified Party to the
extent arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section 3.1(a)_ (
_Organization; Standing and Power_ ), the first two sentences of _Section
3.1(c)_ ( _Subsidiaries_ ), _Section 3.2_ ( _Capitalization_ ) and _Section
3.3(a)_ ( _Authority_ ) (collectively, the "Special Representations"), in
accordance with, and only to the extent of, such Indemnifying Partys Pro
Rata Portion of any such Losses in excess of the Escrow Fund; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Parties
under this Agreement shall be the Merger Consideration, and the maximum
aggregate liability of any individual Indemnifying Party shall be such
Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Indemnifying Party.

 



-66-  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Escrow Fund
shall not be available to compensate any of the Indemnified Parties for any
Losses, and no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover from the Escrow
Fund, unless and until the Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses in excess
of $2,500,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible Amount"), after which the
Escrow Fund, subject to the other terms of this _Article VIII_, shall be
available to compensate each of the Indemnified Parties for any Losses, and,
subject to the terms of this  _Article VIII_, the Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to seek recovery only for such Losses that are in excess of the
Deductible Amount in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund
without regard to the Deductible Amount (i) any Adjustment Amount, (ii) any
Losses to the extent arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy in or
breach of the Special Representations and (iii) any Losses arising out of or
resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of any covenant of the
Company set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ or any breach of any covenant of the
Company set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (ix), (xvi), (xviii), (xxiv) and
(xxvi) of _Section 5.1(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

(i) any Losses recoverable from the Escrow Fund or otherwise from the
Indemnifying Parties hereunder shall be reduced in amount by (A) any Tax
benefits received or realized, and (B) any insurance proceeds, indemnification
payments, contribution payments or reimbursements realized or recovered by any
Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto, and increased in amount by any Tax cost to any
Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of any indemnity payments
hereunder. With respect to clause (B) of the preceding sentence, Parent and
the other Indemnified Parties shall, as a condition to receiving any amounts
from the Escrow Fund or otherwise seeking recovery hereunder, use all
reasonable efforts to realize such proceeds, payments or reimbursements;

 

(ii) no Losses shall be recoverable from the Escrow Fund hereunder that (A)
constitute punitive, consequential, incidental, indirect or special damages
or lost profits (except to the extent such punitive, consequential, incidental
or special damages or lost profits are awarded and recovered from an
Indemnified Party by any third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim), or (B)
could have been avoided through reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses
which were not taken by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and/or the
Indemnified Parties as would be required by applicable Legal Requirements;

 

(iii) the amount of any Loss subject to recovery under this _Article VIII_
shall be calculated net of any amounts specifically accrued or reserved for
in the Company Balance Sheet;

(iv) for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that are
the subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, not for the purposes of determining whether there has been
an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement), each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
shall be read without regard to materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect
or similar qualification as to materiality contained in or otherwise
applicable to such representation or warranty; and

 



-67-  (v) the calculation of Losses shall not include Losses arising from a change
in any applicable Legal Requirement or accounting rule, principle or
interpretation following the Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no Indemnified Party
shall have any right to claim any indemnification under this _Article VIII_
in respect of any breach or non-performance under any Contracts between
the Indemnified Parties or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, other than this Agreement, and
(ii) the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to claim indemnification
under this  _Article VIII_ in respect of any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.19_ or _Section 3.9_ (to the
extent that the representations and warranties in _Section 3.9_ also pertain
to the Legal Requirements that are the subject matter of the representation
and warranty contained in _Section 3.19_) for any Losses arising therefrom
only to the extent that (A) such Losses result from a claim,
action, proceeding or investigation brought by any Governmental Entity (other
than any self-regulatory body) or any individual or group of individuals and
(B) such breach did not result from the actions of any third party causing the
Company to be so in breach; _provided_ that such indemnification shall not be
available to the extent such Losses result from Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates voluntary disclosure to any Governmental Entity
or any individual or group of individuals regarding any matter that is the
subject of a claim for indemnification relating to an alleged breach of or
inaccuracy in any such representation or warranty unless (x) such disclosure
is required by applicable Legal Requirements and, if Parent is permitted
under applicable Legal Requirements to do so, Parent provides the
Securityholders Representative with reasonable advance notice prior to any
such disclosure and consults with, and considers in good faith the views and
recommendations of, the Securityholders Representative and its counsel, in
respect of the content of such disclosure, or (y) if such disclosure is not
required by applicable Legal Requirements and the circumstances surrounding
such alleged breach or inaccuracy are not able to be cured without significant
cost or significant reputational risk to Parent or the Company, if Parent
acting reasonably and in good faith determines that the failure to make
such disclosure (after Parent provides the Securityholders Representative
with reasonable advance notice prior to any such determination and consults
with, and considers in good faith the views and recommendations of, the
Securityholders Representative and its counsel) would reasonably be expected
to materially and adversely affect the business of Parent or the Company after
the Closing Date and the primary purpose of such disclosure is not to recover
the amount of such Losses from the Indemnifying Parties (although, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Loss arising out of or resulting from such disclosure
may serve as a basis for an indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article
VIII_).

 

(e) All Claims for recovery for any Loss or Losses from the Escrow Fund shall
be made pursuant to and in accordance with, and be governed by the terms of,
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

8.4 _Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party may have a right to recover Losses
from the Escrow Fund or otherwise from the Indemnifying Parties hereunder,
then Parent (on behalf of such Indemnified Party) shall deliver an Officers
Certificate to the Securityholders

 



-68-   Representative (with contemporaneous delivery to the Escrow Agent) on or
prior to the Special Expiration Date or Escrow Expiration Date, as applicable.
Subject to the preceding sentence, no delay or failure to give such notice
shall affect the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that such delay or failure actually prejudices the
Indemnifying Partys rights. For the sake of clarity, any Officers
Certificate delivered after the Escrow Expiration Date or the Special
Expiration Date, as applicable, shall be of no effect and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any Losses claimed or specified
therein shall not be indemnifiable Losses hereunder or otherwise.

(b) For a period of twenty (20) business days after receipt of an Officers
Certificate in compliance with _Section 8.4(a)_, the Escrow Agent shall make
no payment pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Securityholders Representative to
make such delivery. After the expiration of such twenty (20)-business day
period, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to Parent, out of the Escrow Fund,
the aggregate amount of Losses set forth in such Officers Certificate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such distribution shall be made if and to the
extent the Securityholders Representative has objected in a written statement
to any claim or claims made in the Officers Certificate, which written
statement shall include in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and
such written statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to
Parent prior to the expiration of such twenty (20)-business day period.

(c) If the Securityholders Representative objects in writing to any claim or
claims by Parent made in any Officers Certificate within such twenty
(20)-business day period, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall
negotiate in good faith for forty-five (45) days after Parents receipt of
such written objection to resolve such objection. If Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and delivered to
the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on
any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms of such memorandum.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached during the forty-five (45)-day period
for good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such
forty-five (45)-day period, either Parent or the Securityholders
Representative may bring suit in accordance with the provisions of _Section
10.10_. The final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction
as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate
shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and the
Escrow Agent shall distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance
therewith. Judgment upon any award rendered by the court may be entered in any
other court having jurisdiction over the applicable party.

8.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth and agreed
herein, the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive recourse for all
Losses actually suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties to the extent
arising out of or resulting from any inaccuracy in, or any breach of, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the parties under this
Agreement or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated hereby. Any
payments required to be made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ shall, in each case, be made _first_ by resort to the Escrow Fund (to
the extent that such fund is available at the time of 

 



-69-   such claim), and _second_ only with respect to breaches of the Special
Representations or any knowing and intentional breach of any covenant of the
Company set forth in  _Section 5.1(b)_, if the balance of the Escrow Fund is
insufficient or unavailable to satisfy the entire amount of such payments to
be made to an Indemnified Party, then by recourse to each Indemnifying Party,
severally and not jointly, in an amount equal to such Indemnifying Partys
Pro Rata Portion (which shall in no event exceed the portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Party). Except for
any amounts recovered by an Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund or from
any Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms set forth herein, and
except in the case of a claim for fraud or any other tort claim against the
tortfeasor thereof in connection with this Agreement (which claim shall not,
for the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, be prohibited or limited by any of the provisions of this
_Article VIII_), no Company Securityholder shall be liable to Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnified Party for any Losses
actually suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties to the extent arising
out of or resulting from any inaccuracy in, or any breach of, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the parties under this
Agreement or otherwise related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.6  _Distribution of Escrow Fund_. Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the
Escrow Fund (the "Escrow Release Amount") shall promptly be delivered to the
Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not
terminate with respect to any amount reasonably necessary to satisfy any
unsatisfied claims for indemnifiable Losses specified in any Officers
Certificate properly delivered to the Escrow Agent and the Securityholders
Representative on or prior to the Escrow Termination Date and in accordance
with the provisions of this _Article VIII_. As soon as any such claim has
been resolved or to the extent that such amounts are no longer reasonably
necessary to continue to be withheld, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
remaining portion(s) of the Escrow Release Amount not reasonably necessary to
satisfy any remaining unresolved claims to the Indemnifying Parties.
Deliveries from the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this
_Section 8.6_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be made in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Escrow Amount, with each amount
rounded to the nearest whole cent ($0.01).

 

8.7 _Securityholders  Representative_.

(a) By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite consent of
the Company Stockholders, each of the Indemnifying Parties (other than such
Company Stockholders, if any, who have perfected appraisal rights under
Delaware Law) shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact (the
"Securityholders Representative") for and on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties to give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment
to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by any
Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims,
to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified Party against any Indemnifying
Party or by any such Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party or any
dispute between any Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in
each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

 



-70-   hereby, and to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholders Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the
Indemnifying Parties with the right to a majority of the Pro Rata Portions of
the Escrow Fund from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Securityholders Representative may resign at any time by providing written
notice of intent to resign to the Indemnifying Parties, which resignation
shall be effective upon the earlier of (A) thirty (30) calendar days
following delivery of such written notice or (B) the appointment of a
successor by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond
shall be required of the Securityholders Representative. 

(b) The Securityholders Representative will incur no liability of any kind
with respect to any action or omission by the Securityholders Representative
hereunder, except in the event of liability arising from the Securityholders
Representatives bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholders Representative shall only have the duties expressly stated
in this Agreement and shall have no other duty, express or implied. The
Securityholders Representative may engage attorneys, accountants and other
professionals and experts. The Securityholders Representative may in good
faith rely conclusively upon information, reports, statements and opinions
prepared or presented by such professionals, and any action taken by the
Securityholders Representative based on such reliance shall be deemed
conclusively to have been taken in good faith. The Indemnifying Parties will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholders Representative from
and against any and all Losses (including the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel and, if necessary, experts, and all reasonable expenses of
document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, the
"Securityholders Representative Expenses"), arising out of or in connection
with the Securityholders Representatives execution and performance of this
Agreement, in each case as such Securityholders Representative Expense is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any
such Securityholders Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have
arisen from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Securityholders Representative or any of its members, managers, agents,
employees or affiliates, the Securityholders Representative will reimburse
the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such Securityholders Representative
Expense attributable to such bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Upon the Escrow Termination Date, the Securityholders
Representative shall deliver the balance of the Representative Reimbursement
Fund to the Escrow Agent, who shall promptly deliver such funds to the
Indemnifying Parties, except with respect to any amount necessary to satisfy
any pending certified requests made by the Securityholders Representative for
Securityholders Representative Expenses. As soon as all such Securityholders
Representative Expenses have been properly paid, the Securityholders
Representative shall deliver the remaining portion of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount to the Escrow Agent, who shall promptly deliver such
funds to the Indemnifying Parties. Deliveries from the
Representative Reimbursement Fund to the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to
this _Section 8.7(b)_ and the Escrow Agreement shall be made in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Portion of the remaining Representative
Reimbursement Amount, with each amount rounded to the nearest whole cent
($0.01). If not recovered by the Securityholders Representative from the
Representative Reimbursement Fund, any Securityholders Representative
Expenses may be recovered by the Securityholders Representative directly
from the Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ that while this section allows the
Securityholders Representative to be paid from the Representative
Reimbursement Fund, this 

 



-71-   section does not relieve the Indemnifying Parties from their obligation to
promptly pay such Securityholders Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred (it being understood that the Indemnifying Parties shall
have no obligation to pay any Securityholders Representative Expenses that
the Securityholders Representative has recovered from the Representative
Reimbursement Fund), nor does it prevent the Securityholders Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. A decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Securityholders Representative, including
an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections
9.4_ or _9.5_ hereof, shall constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Indemnifying Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Securityholders
Representative shall not incur any Securityholders Representative Expenses
hereunder in excess of $5,000 individually or $10,000 in the aggregate without
the prior written consent required under the engagement letter with the
Securityholders Representative in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide to the
Securityholders Representative any documentation or information reasonably
requested by the Securityholders Representative in order to substantiate a
claim made by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII.

8.8 _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim"), other than a Tax Claim which shall be governed
by _Section 6.9(d)_, that the Indemnified Party reasonably believes may
result in a demand against the Escrow Fund or for other indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_, such Indemnified Party and Parent shall
promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) business days thereof) notify the
Securityholders Representative of such claim in writing; _provided_ , that no
delay or failure to give such notice shall affect the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such delay or
failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Parties rights. The
Securityholders Representative may, at its election, undertake and conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , that, upon assumption of
the defense of such claim or litigation, the Securityholders Representative
shall provide an acknowledgement in writing to the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnified Party is entitled to seek indemnification from the
Indemnifying Parties with respect to any Losses to the extent of the
indemnification provisions of this _Article VIII_. If the Securityholders
Representative elects to defend any Third Party Claim, the Securityholders
Representative shall within fifteen (15) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
asserted Third Party Claim so requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its
intent to do so, at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party may, if such Indemnified Party so
desires, employ counsel at such Indemnified Partys own expense to assist in
the participation in and handling (but not determine or control the defense)
of any Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying
Parties shall pay the expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel if (i) any
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the
proceedings and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them or (ii) the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim after the
Securityholders Representative has failed to diligently defend

 



-72-   against such Third Party Claim in good faith as provided in _Section
8.8(b)_. In the event the Securityholders Representative elects to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 9.4_, the
Securityholders Representative shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of
all material events with respect to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if (i) the
Securityholders Representative does not so elect to undertake and conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim, (ii) at any time after assuming the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently
defend against such Third Party Claim in good faith, (iii) such Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith
that it is reasonably likely that such Third Party Claim will give rise to an
indemnification obligation under this Article VIII and may materially
adversely affect the business of Parent from and after the Closing Date or
(iv) the amount of such Third Party Claim exceeds the Escrow Amount, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and undertake the defense of
such claims at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties to the extent that the
expense of such defense is determined to be an indemnifiable Loss hereunder.
If the Securityholders Representative does not elect to undertake and conduct
the defense of a Third Party Claim or the Indemnified Party shall assume and
undertake the defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with the
preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall (A) allow the Securityholders
Representative to participate in the defense of such claim at its own cost
and expenses and (B) undertake the defense of and use all reasonable efforts
to defend such claim and shall consult with the Securityholders
Representative regarding the strategy for the defense of such claim; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that whether or not the Indemnified Party has assumed
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
not settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Securityholders Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) notwithstanding the foregoing,
if the Indemnified Party, acting in good faith and after providing
the Securityholders Representative with a reasonable opportunity to review
and consider such settlement or proposed resolution of any claim, believes
that the Securityholders Representative has unreasonably withheld or delayed
its consent to any such settlement or proposed resolution, then the
Indemnified Party may so settle or resolve such claim (and without prejudice
to the Indemnified Partys ability to seek recovery from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to a claim properly made hereunder), and (ii) in such or any other
event, any settlement or resolution of any such claim made without the express
written consent of the Securityholders Representative (or made with a deemed
consent as described above) shall not be determinative of the existence of or
amount of Losses relating to such matter.

(c) The Securityholders Representative may consent to entry of a judgment,
or enter into a settlement, without the relevant Indemnified Partys prior
written consent only if the judgment or settlement is only for monetary
damages and such settlement or judgment by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Parties to pay the full amount of the liability in connection
with such Third Party Claim and includes an unconditional release of all such
Indemnified Parties from all Liability arising out of such claim or
action. Otherwise, the prior written consent of the relevant Indemnified
Party shall be required (not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld). For the avoidance of doubt, the Securityholders Representative may
not consent to entry of a judgment, or enter into a settlement, without the
relevant Indemnified Partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
conditioned, delayed or withheld) if such judgment or

 



-73-   settlement would result in (i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction
or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a finding or admission of a violation of any Legal
Requirement or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party,
(iii) a finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims
made or threatened against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, or
(iv) any monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Parties.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Securityholders Representative shall
cooperate in defending any Third Party Claim or related litigation subject to
this _Section 8.8_ (and shall enter into a joint defense or similar
agreement to the extent appropriate to protect or preserve attorney-client
privilege) and, subject only to limitations required to preserve attorney-
client privilege, shall make its records relating to the defense available to
the others.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the
Indemnified Party is entitled to and does assume and undertake the defense of
any Third Party Claim relating to any breach of the representations and
warranties in _Section 3.19_ or _Section 3.9_ (but only to the extent that
such representation and warranty also pertains to the Legal Requirements that
are the subject matter of the representation and warranty contained in
_Section 3.19_), the Indemnified Party shall allow the Securityholders
Representative to co-direct and mutually agree (such agreement not to be
unreasonably withheld by either party) on the defense of such claim at its own
cost and expense.

 

8.9 _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties and covenants
of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its representatives knew or should have known,
whether before or after the date hereof, that any such representation or
warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by reason of the Indemnified
Partys waiver of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_, _Section
7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_.

8.10  _Subrogation_. To the extent that any Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_, the Securityholders
Representative shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any
rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution
and other rights of recovery) that any Indemnified Party may have against any
other Person with respect to any Losses, circumstances or matter to which such
indemnification is directly or indirectly related. The Indemnified Parties
shall permit the Securityholders Representative to use the name of the
Indemnified Party in any transaction or in any proceeding or other matter
involving any such rights or remedies.

 

8.11 _Tax Treatment Of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes, the Indemnified
Parties and the Indemnifying Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment
under this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price unless, and then
solely to the extent that, a Final Determination provides otherwise.

8.12 _Adoption by Indemnifying Parties_. By virtue of the adoption of this
Agreement, and where applicable, the execution and delivery of written
consents adopting this Agreement by 

 



-74-   the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have
agreed to the terms and conditions of this _Article VIII_ as such terms apply
to the Indemnifying Parties. 

ARTICLE IX

terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not be available
to any party whose action or failure to act (including the failure to act in
compliance with _Section 6.6_) has been a proximate cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

(d) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other party,
if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action (including the failure to have taken an action), in any
case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, ruling or other action is final
and nonappealable;

(e) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent shall
have become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time
of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty shall have
become untrue, _provided_ that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 9.1(e)_ prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt
of written notice by Parent from the Company of such breach (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(e)_ if the Company is in material breach of this Agreement or
if such breach by Parent is cured within such thirty-day period so that such
conditions would then be satisfied); or

(f) by Parent, upon written notice to the Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue, in

 



-75-   either case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or
_Section 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as
of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue,
_provided_ that Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.1(f)_ prior to the thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice
by the Company from Parent of such breach (it being understood that Parent
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(f)_ if Parent
is in material breach of this Agreement or if such breach by the Company is
cured within such thirty-day period so that such conditions would then be
satisfied).

9.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under _Section 9.1_ will be effective immediately upon the delivery
of a valid written notice of the terminating party to the other party hereto.
In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section

forth in _Section 6.4(a)_, this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_ and _Article
X_, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and (b)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach

obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms.

 

9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Section 2.8_, except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and

the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, _provided_ that after adoption of this Agreement

stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and

10.2 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
such reference shall be to a section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. For purposes of this Agreement, the words "include," "includes" and
"including," when used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The table of contents and headings contained
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made
herein to "the business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to
include the business of all such entity and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. An exception or disclosure made in Company Disclosure Letter with
regard to a representation of the Company, or in the Parent Disclosure Letter
with regard to a representation of Parent or Merger Sub, shall be deemed made
with respect to any other representation by such party to which such exception
or disclosure is reasonably apparent. Any currency or similar thresholds 

 



-78-   set forth herein shall not be used as a benchmark for the determination of
what is or is not "material" or a "Material Adverse Effect" under this
Agreement.

 

10.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until
the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) are
not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder
following the Effective Time, except such provisions that act for the benefit
of (i) the Indemnified Parties set forth in _Article VIII_ and (ii) the
Company Indemnified Parties set forth in _Section 6.8_. Nothing herein shall
affect the rights of the Company Securityholders to receive the merger
consideration by operation of law from and after the Effective Time.

10.5 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

10.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other(s) (as applicable), and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
(or parties) under this Agreement.

 



-79-  10.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached.

 

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

10.9 _Waiver of Conflicts_. The parties hereto (collectively, the "Consenting
Parties") acknowledge that at all times relevant hereto up to the Closing,
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, P.C. ("WSGR") has represented only the
Company. If subsequent to the Closing any dispute were to arise relating in
any manner to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement between the
Securityholders Representative, on the one hand, and another Consenting
Party, on the other hand (each a "Dispute"), the Consenting Parties consent
to WSGRs representation of the Securityholders Representative in the
Dispute(s). The Consenting Parties acknowledge that WSGR has been and will be
providing legal advice to the Company in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and
in such capacity will have obtained confidential information of the Company
(the "Company Confidential Information"). The Company Confidential
Information includes all communications, whether written or electronic,
including any communications between WSGR, the directors, officers,
stockholders, accounting firm, and/or employees of the Company, all files,
attorney notes, drafts or other documents directly relating to this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement, which predate the Closing (collectively, the "WSGR
Work Product"). In any Dispute, to the extent that any Company Confidential
Information is in WSGRs possession at the Effective Time, such Company
Confidential Information may be used on behalf of the Securityholders
Representative in connection with such Dispute at the sole discretion of the
Securityholders Representative. In any Dispute, the Consenting Parties waive
the right to present any WSGR Work Product as evidence in any legal proceeding
(including arbitration) arising out of such Dispute. The Consenting Parties
waive their right to access any WSGR Work Product, except as reasonably
necessary in connection with a legal proceeding that is not a Dispute. The
Consenting Parties hereby consent to the disclosure and use by WSGR for the
benefit of the Company Securityholders and the Securityholders
Representative of any information (confidential or otherwise) disclosed to it
by the Company (including its directors, officers, Company Securityholders,
accounting firm, and/or employees of the Company) prior to the Effective
Time. Except as expressly set forth above, this _Section 10.9_ shall not
grant any rights to the Securityholders Representative with respect to the
Company Confidential Information except as described herein. 

10.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE
AND THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LOCATED WITHIN THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT
OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND OF THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS
AGREEMENT,

 



-80-   AND IN RESPECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND
HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDINGS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF, THAT IT
IS NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE
BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID COURTS OR THAT VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE
APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED
IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS
WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN
SUCH A DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT. DURING SUCH PERIOD AND AS TO
SUCH MATTERS, THE PARTIES HEREBY CONSENT TO AND GRANT ANY SUCH COURT
JURISDICTION OVER THE PERSON OF SUCH PARTIES AND OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER OF
SUCH DISPUTE AND AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER PAPERS IN CONNECTION
WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 10.1_
OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SHALL BE VALID
AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF. WITH RESPECT TO ANY PARTICULAR ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, VENUE SHALL LIE IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

10.11 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

10.12 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; _provided_ , that Parent may assign its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, so long as Parent remains primarily liable for its
obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of this _Section
10.12_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.13 _No Waiver_. No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the
exercise of any right hereunder will impair such right or be construed to be a
waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or
agreement herein, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right
preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.

10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
