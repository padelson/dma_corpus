Section 3.3 _Payments on Closing_.

 



 

(a) _Initial Closing Statement_. Not fewer than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare in good faith and deliver to
Parent and the Shareholder Representative a statement (the " _Initial Closing

Aggregate Merger Consideration, equal to: (i) the Base Merger Consideration,
adjusted by (ii) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the Closing
Net Assets (the " _Estimated Net Assets_ ") estimated as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, including in reasonable detail the basis for the
computation and reasonable supporting documentation therefor, and the
resulting amount of the Estimated Net Assets Surplus, if any, or the Estimated

by_ (ii) the Total Fully Diluted Common Stock. The Initial

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Statement shall be accompanied by the Flow of Funds Memorandum,
prepared in good faith by the Company in conformity with the Initial Closing
Statement and the ownership of the Common Stock and Company Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Flow of Funds Memorandum shall

Memorandum by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or
accounts set forth in the Flow of Funds Memorandum and (ii) to each holder of

amounts to be withheld and delivered with respect to holders of Company
Options pursuant to _Section 3.6_) for such Company Option as set forth
opposite such holders name in the Flow of Funds Memorandum by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts set forth in the
Flow of Funds Memorandum.

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration Escrow_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Shareholder Representative, Parent, the Company and the Escrow Agent shall
enter into an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit F_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, into an account maintained by
the Escrow Agent (the " _Merger Consideration Escrow Account_ "), an amount of

Merger Consideration Escrow Account shall be governed by the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Indemnification Escrow_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, into an account maintained by the Escrow

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock or Company Options, as applicable, other than the right to receive the
Net Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each
share of Common Stock held by them, or the applicable Net Per Option Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, for each Company Option held by
them, as applicable.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Common Stock or Company Options for any portion of the
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Closing Statement_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall, at its expense,
prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the Shareholder
Representative a written statement setting forth Parents calculation of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, equal to: (i) the Base Merger Consideration,
adjusted by (ii) the Parents reasonable, good faith determination of the
Closing Net Assets as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including in
reasonable detail the basis for the computation and reasonable supporting
documentation therefor, and the resulting amount of the Net Assets Surplus, if
any, or the Net Assets Deficit, if any, as applicable (the " _Closing
Statement_ "). The Closing Statement shall be prepared using GAAP,
consistently applied as used by the Company in preparing its year-end audited
financial statements (but giving effect to the adjustments set forth in the
definition of "Closing Net Assets" hereunder). During such sixty (60) day
period and until the date of the determination of the Final Closing Statement,
Parent agrees to provide, or cause its employees (including the employees of
the Surviving Corporation) to provide, the Shareholder Representative and its
Representatives with reasonable access during regular business hours to the
relevant books, records and personnel of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Review and Dispute of Closing Statement_. The Shareholder Representative
shall have thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement by Parent
to review the same and, if he objects to any aspect of such Closing Statement,
to deliver to Parent a written statement thereon (the " _Protest Notice_ ").
The Protest Notice shall list the specific items included in the Closing
Statement, if any, to which the Shareholder Representative takes exception and
the Shareholder Representatives proposed adjustment, including in reasonable
detail the basis for the computation and reasonable supporting documentation
therefor. Subject to Parents compliance with its obligations to provide
access to the relevant books, records and personnel of the Surviving
Corporation under _Section 3.4(a)_, the failure of the Shareholder
Representative to deliver such Protest Notice within such thirty (30) day
period following delivery of the Closing Statement will constitute the
Shareholder Representatives acceptance of the Closing Statement as prepared
by Parent and the Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the
Shareholder Representative and the holders of Common Stock and Company
Options. If the Shareholder Representative timely delivers a Protest Notice to
Parent and Parent does not give the Shareholder Representative notice of its
objections to such Protest Notice within thirty (30) days

 



      
 

 



 

following receipt of such Protest Notice, Parent shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Statement as adjusted by the Shareholder Representative
in the Protest Notice. If Parent objects to the Protest Notice within said
thirty (30) day period following delivery to Parent of the Protest Notice (the
adjustments to which Parent objects being referred to herein as the "
_Contested Adjustments_ "), the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute regarding the Contested
Adjustments. If a final resolution thereof is not reached within ten (10)
Business Days of the Shareholder Representatives receipt of Parents
objections thereto, either the Shareholder Representative or Parent shall
thereafter be entitled to refer any remaining Contested Adjustments to an
internationally recognized independent public accounting firm that does not
regularly represent either Parent or the Company as shall be agreed upon in
writing by the Shareholder Representative and Parent (the " _Independent
Accounting Firm_ "). If there is such a referral to the Independent Accounting
Firm, each of the Shareholder Representative and Parent agrees, if requested
by the Independent Accounting Firm, to execute a reasonable engagement letter
and shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm not later than ten (10)
Business Days after its appointment, a written statement summarizing its
position on the Contested Adjustments, together with such supporting
documentation as it deems necessary. The Independent Accounting Firm shall act
in its capacity as an expert in accounting and not as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on the materials submitted and presentations by the
Shareholder Representative and Parent, and not by independent review, only the
Contested Adjustments that have not been settled by negotiation and shall be
instructed to render its decision within forty-five (45) days of its
appointment or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable. In making its
determination, the Independent Accounting Firm will select Parents
calculations of the Contested Adjustments, the Shareholder Representatives
calculations of the Contested Adjustments or any amount in between the two,
and will use GAAP in a manner consistent with the requirements set forth
herein for preparation of the Closing Statement. The decision of the
Independent Accounting Firm as to the Contested Adjustments shall be final and
binding on, and shall not be subject to appeal by, the Shareholder
Representative or Parent, and may be entered and enforced by any court having
jurisdiction. The Closing Statement shall be revised as necessary to reflect
the decision of the Independent Accounting Firm and the other modifications
thereto previously agreed to by the Shareholder Representative and Parent.
Each of the Shareholder Representative and Parent shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of the Closing Statement, and the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by
the Shareholder Representative, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand. The term " _Final Closing Statement_ ," as used in this Agreement, shall
mean the definitive Closing Statement accepted by the Shareholder
Representative or agreed to by Parent and the Shareholder Representative or
the definitive Closing Statement resulting from the determinations made by the
Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section 3.4(b)_ (in
addition to those items theretofore accepted by the Shareholder Representative
or agreed to by Parent and the Shareholder Representative).

 



 

(c) Within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing
Statement:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) If the Aggregate Merger Consideration equals the Estimated Aggregate
Merger Consideration, or if Additional Merger Consideration is due, then (A)
Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall provide a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Merger
Consideration Escrow Account an amount equal to the Merger Consideration
Escrow Amount (together with any earnings on the Merger Consideration Escrow
Amount and less such amounts to be withheld and delivered with respect to
holders of Company Options pursuant to _Section 3.6_) by wire transfer to the
Shareholder Representative, for distribution to the holders of Common Stock
and Company Options in accordance with each such holders Pro Rata Portion
thereof for each share of Common Stock or Company Option to acquire a share of
Common Stock that had been held by such holder immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) Parent shall deliver promptly an amount in cash equal
to the Additional Merger Consideration, if greater than zero, by wire transfer
to the Shareholder Representative, for distribution to the holders of Common
Stock and Company Options in accordance with each such holders Pro Rata
Portion thereof for each share of Common Stock or Company Option to acquire a
share of Common Stock that had been held by such holder immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) If there is an Excess Amount due that is less than or equal to the Merger
Consideration Escrow Amount, then Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver
promptly from the Merger Consideration Escrow Account by wire transfer (A) to
Parent, the Excess Amount (together with the corresponding proportion of any
earnings on the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount) and (B) to the Shareholder
Representative (less such amounts to be withheld and delivered with respect to
holders of Company Options pursuant to _Section 3.6_), for distribution to
the holders of Common Stock and Company Options, the remaining amount
(including any remaining earnings) of funds held in the Merger Consideration
Escrow Amount (after distributions to the Parent in accordance with the
foregoing clause (ii)(A) hereof), to be distributed to each such holder in the
same manner as set forth in clause (i)(A) of this _Section 3.4(c)_.

 



 

(iii) If there is an Excess Amount due that is greater than the Merger
Consideration Escrow Amount, then (A) Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver promptly from the Merger Consideration Escrow Account by wire
transfer to Parent all the funds then in the Merger Consideration Escrow
Account (including any earnings on the Merger Consideration Escrow Amount) and
(B) each holder of Common Stock or Company Options shall, pursuant to the
terms of a letter agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Equity Holder Letter Agreement_ "), pay by wire transfer to Parent an
amount (the " _Holder Overpayment Amount_ ") for each share of Common Stock or
Company Option to acquire a share of Common Stock that had been held by such
holder immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount equal to the Pro Rata
Portion of the difference between (x) the Excess Amount _minus_ (y) the Merger
Consideration Escrow Amount.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Post-Indemnification Payments_. All funds in the Indemnification
Escrow Account shall be distributed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement
and this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article III
_or otherwise such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld and paid over
to the applicable Governmental Entity shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Stock or
Company Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
With respect to any amounts to be so deducted and withheld with respect to
consideration otherwise payable from the Merger Consideration Escrow Account
or the Indemnification Escrow Account to any holder of Company Options
pursuant to this _Article III_, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver
promptly from the Merger Consideration Escrow Account or the Indemnification
Escrow Account, as applicable, by wire transfer to the Surviving Corporation
such amounts to be so deducted and withheld.

Section 4.25 _Securitization Matters_.

 



 

(a) (i) Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.25(a)(i)_ , as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date, substantially all of the Vehicle/Equipment Leases

Vehicle/Equipment Lease. _Schedule 4.25(a)(i)_ sets forth each
Vehicle/Equipment Lease to which the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

Donlen Trust is a party which is not an Eligible Vehicle/Equipment Lease and
describes which components of the Eligible Vehicle/Equipment Lease definition
each such Vehicle/Equipment Lease fails to meet and sets forth in reasonable
detail the reason for each such failure; and (ii) with respect to each
Vehicle/Equipment Lease to which the Company or Donlen Trust is a party,
_Schedule 4.25(a)(ii)_ sets forth as of the date specified on such _Schedule
4.25(a)(ii)_ (which date shall not be more than one month prior to the date

(c) The representations and warranties of Donlen Trust and the Company and its
Affiliates contained in the Conduit Facility Documents shall be true and
correct as of the date hereof and the Closing Date. Each of Donlen Trust and
the Company and its Affiliates have complied with each of their covenants and
agreements set forth in the Conduit Facility Documents.

 



 

(d) No payout event, servicer default, servicing termination, early
amortization event, or similar event, and no event that with the giving of
notice or the passage of time or both would constitute any such event, has
occurred and is continuing on the date hereof, and the Company is not aware of
any allegation that there is currently any such event or that the Company, as
servicer, has historically conducted its servicing obligations in a way that
would have given rise to any such event. Attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ are
correct and complete copies of waivers evidencing the retention of the Conduit
Facilities.

 



 

(e) _Separateness_.

 



 

(i) The transactions contemplated by the Conduit Facility Documents have been
disclosed to third parties as follows:

 



 

(1) The certificates of title for all Vehicles/Equipment, if applicable, owned
by Donlen Trust (including Vehicles/Equipment allocated to the Financed SUBIs)
filed with the applicable secretary of state or governmental authority (and of
public record) within the national boundaries of the United States (the States
and the District of Columbia) list Donlen Trust (and not the Company or any
Conduit Borrower) as owner of such Vehicles/Equipment.

 



 

(2) The Financed SUBI Certificates issued by Donlen Trust and held by the
respective agents (as collateral) list the applicable Conduit Borrower as
holder of the respective Financed SUBI and such Financed SUBI Certificate. To
the Companys knowledge,

 



      
 

 



 

without independent investigation, such ownership is noted in the records of
the applicable administrative trustee.

 



 

(3) The computer records of the Company, as servicer, relating to assets
allocated to the Financed SUBIs have been marked to reflect the respective
transfers as contemplated by the Conduit Facility Documents.

 



 

(4) The Company has not intentionally concealed any transfer contemplated by
the Conduit Facility Documents from any interested party.

 



 

(ii) In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Conduit Facility
Documents the Company believes, to its knowledge, but without independent
investigation or full information as to the intent or practices of unrelated
third parties, that the formation and maintenance of each of the Conduit
Borrowers and Donlen Trust as an entity separate and distinct from the Company
was a necessary precondition to obtaining the agreement of each agent and the
related lenders to enter into the Conduit Facility Documents. As a condition
to closing and funding the applicable financing transactions under the Conduit
Facility Documents, the agents and lenders under each applicable transaction
required legal opinions as to: (A) the characterization of the transfer from
Donlen Corporation to the applicable Conduit Borrower of the identified assets
(the "Transferred Assets") being transferred under the applicable sale
agreement between such parties as a true sale in the event of a bankruptcy;
and (B) the identity of the applicable Conduit Borrower and Donlen Trust as
separate from Donlen Corporation and each other under applicable bankruptcy
substantive consolidation principles.

 



 

(iii) The terms of the applicable SUBI Sale Agreement and other transactions
between the Company, on the one hand, and the applicable Conduit Borrower or
Donlen Trust, on the other hand, are (A) consistent with those of arms-length
relationships and (B) fair and equitable to each of the parties. None of the
transactions contemplated by the Conduit Facility Documents were entered into
with the intent to hinder, defraud or delay any of the creditors of the
Company.

 



 

(iv) The Company intends the related transfer of Transferred Assets to be a
true sale by the Company to the applicable Conduit Borrower that provides such
Conduit Borrower with the full benefits of ownership of the Transferred
Assets, and that, subject to the terms of the Conduit Facility Documents,
including representations and warranties provided by the Company to the
Conduit Borrowers thereunder, is absolute and irrevocable.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) At the time that the Company accepted a subordinated note from any Conduit
Borrower, it believed in good faith that the obligations of such Conduit
Borrower evidenced by such subordinated note would be collectible in the
ordinary course.

 



 

(vi) With respect to the Companys role as servicer of the Financed SUBI
Portfolios: (A) the contractual servicing fee compensates the Company for its
activities as servicer and was intended to be an arms length servicing fee on
terms that were consistent with what would be charged by an unrelated servicer
at the time such contract was entered into by the Company; (B) the Companys
retention of certain other rights as servicer and the books and records
pertaining to the Transferred Assets is intended to facilitate collections and
avoid disrupting customer relationships; and (C) the Companys right to direct
deposits of resale proceeds from Vehicles/Equipment allocated to a Financed
SUBI into the QI Account (rather than the lockbox account into which
collections from the Financed SUBI Portfolio are deposited) pursuant to the
LKE Program and its corresponding right to substitute replacement funds for
such resale proceeds are meant to gain favorable tax treatment on the sale of
Vehicles/Equipment and purchase of new vehicles and are not related to the
performance of the Transferred Assets. The Company, as servicer, has performed
in all material respects such services (x) in a manner that, consistent with
reasonable commercial practices, discloses its independent contractor/agent
status to third parties and (y) otherwise pursuant to and within the context
and limitations of the Conduit Facility Documents.

 



 

(vii) There are no, and have not been any, Contracts, agreements or
understandings between the Conduit Borrowers or Donlen Trust, on the one hand,
and the Company or any of the Companys other Affiliates, on the other hand,
that would materially alter the terms and intent reflected in the Conduit
Facility Documents. In addition, there are no, and have not been any, other
agreements or understandings pursuant to which the Company or another of its
other Affiliates (A) is responsible for maintaining each Conduit Borrowers or
Donlen Trusts solvency or providing additional capital or (B) provides
recourse, guarantees or otherwise retains or assumes financial risks with
respect to the Transferred Assets other than the limited obligations expressly
set forth in the Conduit Facility Documents. The Company has capitalized each
Conduit Borrower with a demand note and may capitalize each such Conduit
Borrower with other demand notes or similar instruments that are not, and have
never been, through the Closing Date, pledged by the Conduit Borrowers as
collateral under the Conduit Facility Documents but such demand notes do
provide financial support for the Conduit Borrowers that the Company believes
in its reasonable business judgment is appropriate with respect to the
adequate capitalization by a parent company of its subsidiary.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) The Company, as servicer, has retained books and records relating to
the Transferred Assets because, among other reasons, in the good faith
judgment of the Company, a transfer of such possession to Conduit Borrowers
would be administratively burdensome and would interfere with the servicers
performance of its duties.

 



 

(ix) The Company is the initial beneficiary of Donlen Trust and Donlen Trust
was formed in 2001 for the special purpose of holding title to vehicles and
becoming the lessor of the leases of such vehicles.

 



 

(x) The Company has acted in a manner that is consistent with Donlen Trusts
separate and distinct existence and has corrected any known misunderstanding
regarding the status of Donlen Trust as a separate entity for State law
purposes (but not federal income tax purposes). In this regard, Donlen Trust,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, have not (A) operated or
purported to operate as an integrated single economic entity with respect to
each other or any affiliated or unaffiliated third party, (B) endeavored to
obtain credit or incurred any obligation to any affiliated or unaffiliated
third party based upon the assets or creditworthiness of the other (other than
with respect to the equity ownership of the Company in Donlen Trust), or (C)
failed to correct any known misunderstanding or misrepresentation with respect
to any of the foregoing.

 



 

(xi) The Companys assets and liabilities can be readily and inexpensively
segregated, ascertained and identified separate from those of Donlen Trust and
are correctly reflected on the Companys corporate and financial records in a
manner consistent with reasonable commercial practices (and subject to
customary accounting and tax consolidated reporting). All transactions between
the Company, on the one hand, and Donlen Trust, on the other hand, including
monetary transactions, at all times have been properly reflected in the
Companys books and records in all material respects in a manner consistent
with commercial practices for similar types of transactions within the
industry generally and have been, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
entered into on terms and conditions consistent with those of an arms length
transaction.

 



 

(xii) The actual consolidation of the Companys business operations, on the
one hand, and any of Donlen Trusts business operations, on the other hand,
would not result in any significant cost savings or in a significantly greater
efficiency or profitability of such combined business operations.

 



 

(xiii) The Company, on the one hand, and Donlen Trust, on the other hand, do
not intend to commingle their assets and

 



      
 

 



 

liabilities, except that the Company, as servicer of the Financed SUBI
Portfolios: (A) may commingle collections prior to distribution thereof in
accordance with the Conduit Facility Documents and (B) has retained physical
books and records pertaining to and evidencing the Financed SUBI Portfolios
together with its own physical books and records pertaining to and evidencing
similar assets held by it for itself or other third parties.

 



 

(xiv) Donlen Trust is operated for the exclusive purpose of holding title to
vehicles, leases and related assets that are serviced by the Company and
beneficially held either directly or indirectly by the Company or its
assignee. Donlen Trust will not have any employees, and the day-to-day
business operations with respect to the Financed SUBI Portfolio have been
conducted through the Company, in its capacity as servicer, pursuant to the
servicing agreement and the servicing supplements that have been executed
thereunder. The Company and Donlen Trust may share some expenses not reflected
in servicers fees, but these are not expected to be material in the judgment
of the Company. Donlen Trust is held out to the public as a separate entity
apart from the Company, including as described above.

 



 

(xv) In addition to the Conduit Facility Documents, equity interests evidenced
by SUBI Certificates in Donlen Trust have been sold by the Company to
unrelated third parties for whom the Company also acts as servicer pursuant to
the servicing agreement and the applicable separate servicing supplements
executed with each such third party purchaser.

 



 

(xvi) All oral and written communications of Donlen Trust and Donlen
Corporation, including without limitation, correspondence, legal agreements,
contracts for the purchase and sale of vehicles (and title to such vehicles)
and similar business practices are made by each such entity in its own name;
provided that communications and other documents may be signed by the Company
on behalf of Donlen Trust in its capacity as servicer.

 



 

(xvii) The Company adheres to corporate formalities in all transfers of assets
and other transactions between the Company, on the one hand, and Donlen Trust,
on the other hand. The Company observes appropriate corporate formalities
under applicable Law.

 



 

(xviii) The Company does not currently, and does not intend to, guaranty, and
is not otherwise obligated to repay, the Liabilities of Donlen Trust, except
to the extent that the Companys indemnities in the Conduit Facility Documents
may be considered guaranties. To the extent that those indemnities cover
Donlen Trusts

 



      
 

 



 

actions or failures to act, the Company considers the likelihood that the
Company will incur Liabilities under those indemnities to be remote and
immaterial.

 



 

(xix) Donlen Trust has paid its own expenses, except as specifically provided
in the Conduit Facility Documents.

 



 

(xx) Neither the Company nor Donlen Trust has held itself out as responsible
for the debts of the other party.

 



 

Section 4.26 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _Article IV_, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company nor any other Person acting on behalf of the Company
or any such Subsidiary, makes any representation or warranty, express or
implied.

compensation that is no less favorable than the base compensation provided to

opportunities (but not taking into account any form of equity or equity-based
compensation) provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and
policies (including any cash equalization payments) that in the aggregate are

participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits, service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service shall not be recognized (i) for any purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan in which Company Employees may be
entitled to participate after the Effective Time, or (ii) to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods or evidence of
insurability requirements. Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing condition
limitations to the extent waived or not applicable under the applicable
Benefit Plan. Nothing provided in this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall prevent Parent
from terminating any employee, subject to applicable severance obligations or
agreements or Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) During the Continuation Period, the Company Employees shall be entitled to
participate in any incentive compensation plan of Parent or a Subsidiary
thereof , in each case to the same extent as similarly situated employees of

benefit plans and programs.

reasonably required to permit Company Employees to pay off existing 401(k)

coverage or benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-certification
requirements), and/or making other changes in administration or changes in the
design, coverage and benefits given to Company Employees, (ii) be construed as
a limitation on the right of Parent to suspend, amend, modify or terminate any
employee benefit plan, arrangement or agreement, (iii) be construed as an
amendment to any employee benefit plan, arrangement or agreement, or (iv) be
construed as limiting Parents discretion and authority to interpret the
respective employee benefit and compensation plans, agreements, arrangements
and programs, in accordance with their terms and applicable Law.

Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably

carriers with respect to directors and officers liability insurance policies
and fiduciary liability insurance policies, for the persons who are covered by
the Companys existing coverage, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels
of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing coverage with

and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Sub, the Company

books and records is not required under commercially reasonable document
retention policies of the Surviving Corporation or applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.9 _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary,
stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and
additions to any such Taxes) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent. Parent shall provide the
Shareholder Representative with evidence that such Transfer Taxes have been
paid.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) in a manner
consistent with applicable Law and file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date.
Prior to the filing of any Tax Returns relating to or including periods prior
to the Closing Date, Parent shall permit the Shareholder Representative to
review and comment on such Tax Returns and shall make such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative.
Parent shall not amend (or cause to be amended) any Tax Return of the Company
or any Subsidiary filed on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries, and the
Shareholder Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest for the tax year in
which the Closing Date occurs and for any prior tax year. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other parties request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such
Tax Return or Tax Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Tax Contests_. If, subsequent to the Closing Date, Parent, the Company or
any Subsidiary receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return
which could result in any payment under _Section 9.2_, then within thirty
(30) days after receipt of such notice, Parent shall notify the Shareholder
Representative of such notice. Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall keep the Shareholder Representative reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest and shall not agree to any settlement or
compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining the Shareholder
Representatives prior written consent thereto, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
receives any settlement offer from a Tax authority with respect to a claim for
which any Parent Indemnified Party seeks or may seek indemnity from any holder
of Common Stock, Parent shall promptly inform the Shareholder Representative
of the receipt of such settlement offer. If the Shareholder Representative
recommends acceptance of such settlement offer, but Parent declines to accept
such offer in writing within thirty (30) days: (i) the entitlement of Parent
to indemnification payments under this Agreement as the result of any such
contest or proceedings shall not exceed the entitlement that Parent would have
had if such contest had been settled or proceeding terminated on the basis of
the settlement offer the acceptance of which was recommended by the
Shareholder Representative; and (ii) the shareholders of the Company shall
have no further liability for costs or other expenses in respect of such
contest. The Parents notice obligations and the Shareholder Representatives
consent and other rights described in this _Section 6.9(c)_ shall apply only
for so long as the amount at issue may be satisfied in whole or in part, out
of any

 



       
 

 



 

remaining balance, not otherwise subject to any other claims, in the
Indemnification Escrow Account

 



 

(d) _Tax Refunds_. In the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled by Law to a refund of Taxes attributable to any period prior to the
Closing Date (other than a refund that is attributable in whole or in part to
the carryback of a net operating loss), Parent agrees to cooperate with the
Shareholder Representative to file or cause to be filed an amended Tax Return
or refund claim relating to such Tax refund. Any such refund of Taxes of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any interest with respect
thereto) shall be paid promptly to the Shareholder Representative for
distribution to the holders of Common Stock or Company Options in accordance
with each such holders Pro Rata Portion thereof for each share of Common
Stock or Company Option to acquire a share of Common Stock that had been held
by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Tax Indemnity_.

 



 

(i) Parent and its Affiliates shall, without duplication, be indemnified and
held harmless, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 9.5_
and subject to the conditions and limitations in this _Article VI_ and in
_Article IX_ of this Agreement, from any (x) Tax of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to the extent the
amount of such Taxes exceeds the amount accrued as a liability for Taxes on
the Final Closing Statement and (y) liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses),
losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of or
incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in
(x) (the sum of (x) and (y) being referred to herein as a " _Tax Loss_ "). All
amounts indemnified pursuant to this _Section 6.9(e)_ shall be payable solely
from (and shall not exceed the amount available in) the Indemnification Escrow
Account (after giving effect to any prior or concurrent withdrawals
therefrom). The rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes and Tax Returns
shall be governed solely by this _Section 6.9(e)_ and not by any other
section.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 6.9(e)_, in order to apportion
appropriately any Taxes relating to any Straddle Period, the parties hereto
shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant
Tax authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of
the taxable year or period of the Company and each Subsidiary. In any case
where applicable Law does not permit the Company or any Subsidiary to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period, then in the
case of any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Taxes allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date shall (x) in the case of any

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes other than gross receipts, sales or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or
related to income, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period _multiplied by_ a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle
Period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income and any
gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth
in the foregoing clause (y) shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In all cases, any transaction
that occurs on the Closing Date and after the Closing shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having occurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(f) For Tax purposes: (i) the Merger shall be treated as a purchase by Parent
of the Common Stock, and (ii) the Minority Interest Transfer shall be treated
as an acquisition by Parent of the Minority Subsidiary Interests. The purchase
price for the Minority Subsidiary Interests shall be equal to the Minority
Interests Consideration. The aggregate purchase price for the Common Stock
shall be equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration. No consideration shall
be allocated to the Non-Competition Agreement. Each party to this agreement
shall prepare and file, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to prepare
and file, all Tax Returns and necessary forms in such a manner as to reflect
the allocation of the consideration as determined in accordance with this
_Section 6.9(f)_ and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in
any financial statement or in any audit or other judicial or administrative
proceeding.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Affiliate Agreements_. The Company shall cause all Affiliate
Agreements listed on Part I of _Schedule 4.22_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to be terminated prior to the Effective Time without any further or
continuing Liability on the part of Parent, Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, prior
to the Closing, to establish one or more asset-backed financing facilities
(collectively, the " _New ABS Program_ ") necessary, together with available
cash of Parent, to fund the aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with
the terms hereof, to repay the Payoff Indebtedness and pay all related fees
and expenses. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and will
request their respective Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with Parent,
Sub and their authorized Representatives in connection with the establishment
and negotiation by Parent and Sub of the New ABS Program, including (a)
assisting in the preparation for and participating on reasonable advance
notice in a reasonable number of lender and investor meetings, presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, meetings with rating agencies and similar
events, (b) furnishing information (including financial statements) reasonably
required to be included in, and providing reasonable assistance with, the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses, rating agency

 



      
 

 



 

presentations and similar documents, (c) without limitation of clause (b)
above, as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnishing Parent and its
lenders with financial and other information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including data regarding the Companys lease portfolio and fleet
management and maintenance services, in each case on both a current and
historical basis) as may be reasonably requested by Parent to establish and
negotiate the New ABS Program, or as otherwise reasonably required in
connection with the New ABS Program and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the information in clauses (b) and (c) being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Required Information_ ") and (d) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by
Parent that are necessary or customary to establish the New ABS Program. The
Company will provide Parent with updates to the Required Information as
reasonably requested by Parent and to the extent prepared in the ordinary
course of its business or which can be reasonably prepared, so that Parent may
implement the New ABS Program. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that their
respective obligations hereunder (including their respective obligations to
consummate the Merger) are not conditioned in any manner upon Parent and Sub
obtaining the New ABS Program. Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree to
reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for their reasonable expenses
(including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses) incurred
by the Company and its Subsidiaries in order to comply with the provisions of
this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Payoff of Payoff Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain payoff letters
from each of the Persons to whom any Payoff Indebtedness is owed evidencing
the amount (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") necessary to pay-off, at Closing, all
existing Indebtedness under the Payoff Indebtedness. Immediately prior to the
Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, (a) pay, on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Payoff Amount to an
account or accounts designated by the lenders under the applicable Payoff
Indebtedness and (b) provide, on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, such other funds or backstop letters of credit as may be
necessary to satisfy the conditions precedent to termination of the Payoff
Indebtedness.

with respect to such inaccuracy and shall be deemed to have waived its rights
to indemnification in respect thereof.

_Third-Party Claims_ ") shall be governed by the following additional terms
and conditions:

 



 

(i) If an Indemnified Party shall receive written notice of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give all Indemnifying Parties
(which in the case of Parent Indemnified Parties shall consist of notice to
the Shareholder Representative, who shall be deemed to be the Indemnifying
Party for purposes of this _Section 9.5_) notice of such Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , that failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability which the Indemnifying Party
may have on account of this indemnity or otherwise, except and only to the
extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced by such
failure in connection with the administration or defense of such Third-Party
Claim. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts known
to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such Third-Party Claim, and the
amount, or good faith estimate of the amount, of Losses arising therefrom. The
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and

 



      
 

 



 

documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to a Third-Party Claim;

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party (through the Shareholder Representative, in the
case of any indemnity provided to a Parent Indemnified Party) shall be
entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if it gives written notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party (or such earlier date as an
answer may be due in connection with any applicable legal proceeding) in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such
Third-Party Claim incurred after the Indemnified Party receives such notice
from the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines based upon the written advice of counsel that a
conflict of interest exists that would make it inappropriate for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party,
then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not in such event be responsible hereunder for the
fees and expenses of more than one firm of separate counsel in connection with
any Third-Party Claim in the same jurisdiction, in addition to any local
counsel. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to
undertake any such defense against such Third-Party Claim as provided above,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Partys
possession or under the Indemnifying Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No compromise or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim may be effected by either the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Parties without the other partys consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); other than a compromise or settlement
agreed to by the Indemnifying Party in which (i) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Law and no effect on any other claims that may
be made against each Indemnified Party that is a party to such claim and (ii)
each Indemnified Party that is party to such claim is released from liability
with respect to such claim; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) A claim for indemnification for any matter not constituting a Third-
Party Claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party by written notice to
the Indemnifying Party (which in the case of Parent Indemnified Parties shall
consist of notice to the Shareholder Representative, who shall be deemed to be
the Indemnifying Party for purposes of this _Section 9.5_) as specified in
the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Delivery and Release from Escrow Account_. Upon the resolution of
any indemnification claim for which a cash payment is to be made to a Parent
Indemnified Party, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall take such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the Escrow Agent to make
such payment from funds in the Indemnification Escrow Account.

 



 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy for each of the Parent Indemnified Parties and Shareholder Indemnified
Parties with respect to any and all claims and Losses relating to a breach of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (other than (a) claims of, or
causes of action arising from, fraud, (b) claims under the Non-Competition
Agreement and (c) claims under the Equity Holder Letter Agreement) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ and
shall be limited in the case of the Parent Indemnified Parties, to recovery of
amounts available in the Indemnification Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and no such payment shall
exceed the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount available on any given
payment date. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parent Indemnified
Parties and the Shareholder Indemnified Parties hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes
of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud,
claims under the Non-Competition Agreement and claims under the Equity Holder
Letter Agreement) it may have following the Closing against the other parties
hereto, arising under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign Law,
other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article IX_ or
_Section 6.9(e)_, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, this _Section 9.7_ and _Section 6.9(e)_ shall not limit a
partys right to specific performance or injunctive relief in connection with
the other partys breach of its covenants in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document. For the avoidance of doubt, no claim may be made against
the Indemnification Escrow Account arising out of or relating to the Equity
Holder Letter or the Non-Competition Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Any indemnification payments
made pursuant to this _Article IX_ or _Section 6.9(e)_ shall be treated by
the parties as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for Tax purposes.

 



 

Section 9.9 _No Consequential or Other Damages_. Notwithstanding anything else
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Indemnifying Party shall be
liable to or otherwise responsible for consequential, incidental, special or
punitive damages or lost profits.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 9.10 _Duty to Mitigate_. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof arising out of any matter for
which any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant
hereto.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Adjustment for Insurance_. If any Losses sustained by an
Indemnified Party are covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification,
contribution or similar obligation of another person (other than an Affiliate
of such Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments. If the Indemnified Party receives insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments prior to being
indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed under _Section 9.2_ or _Section
9.3_, as applicable, with respect to such Losses, the payment by the
Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ with respect to such Losses shall
be reduced by the net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments to the extent related to such Losses (less
reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses actually incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery and not reimbursed by such
third party source). If the Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being indemnified and
held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, the
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party (or shall deposit into
the Indemnification Escrow Account, in the event the Indemnified Party is a
Parent Indemnified Party and the insurance recovery occurs on or before the
later to occur of (a) the resolution of all claims to which indemnity has been
sought or (b) to the Expiration Date) the net amount of such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment to the extent related
to such Losses (less reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses actually
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such recovery and not
reimbursed by such third party source).

 



 

Section 9.12 _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any indemnifiable Losses under this
Agreement shall be net of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified
Party arising from the incurrence or payment of such Losses or the event that
gave rise to such Losses and any correlative adjustments resulting from such
Losses (for the avoidance of doubt, if a Tax benefit is actually realized by
the Indemnified Party after the payment of any indemnification hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over the amount of such Tax benefit to
the Indemnifying Party when such Tax benefit is actually realized (or, in the
event the Indemnifying Party is or would have been the Escrow Agent, the
Shareholder Representative on behalf of the holders of Common Stock and
Company Options)).

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 10.1 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all

 



      
 

 



 

respects, whether before or after any vote of the shareholders of the Company
contemplated hereby, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action
taken by their respective boards of directors (or individuals holding similar
positions), at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the
terms contained herein; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ that after the approval
of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall reduce or change the Merger Consideration or
adversely affect the rights of the Companys shareholders hereunder without
the approval of such shareholders.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Shareholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) In connection with this Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall
have exclusive power and authority on behalf of the holders of Common Stock
and Company Options and, prior to the Effective Time on behalf of the Company
with respect to any action taken pursuant to this Agreement (including with
respect to indemnification claims, waivers and adjustments to the Merger
Consideration) and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to rely on
such actions of the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative
is hereby appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact for each holder of Common
Stock or Company Options with full power of substitution to act in the name,
place and stead of such holder with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to act on behalf of
such holder in any amendment of or litigation or arbitration involving this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to do or refrain from doing
all such further acts and things, and to negotiate, execute and deliver all
ancillary agreements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals,
extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents, as the
Shareholder Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. The Shareholder Consents shall expressly ratify and
approve the designation of Gary Rappeport as Shareholder Representative, as
well as all of the foregoing set forth in this _Section 10.2(a)_. The
Shareholder Representative hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to serve
in the capacity contemplated by this _Section 10.2_. The Shareholder
Representative may resign at any time, and the Shareholder Representative may
be removed by the vote of Persons who collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Majority Holders_ "). In the event that the Shareholder
Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Shareholder Representative
shall be appointed by a vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to
become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Shareholder
Representative. Any successor Shareholder Representative must agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement applicable to the
Shareholder Representative and will thereupon become the Shareholder
Representative for purposes of this Agreement and all other applicable
Transaction Documents. Parent shall be provided with ten (10) days prior
written notice of any change in the Shareholder Representative.

 



 

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall not (i) be liable to the holders of
Common Stock or Company Options for any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it or any agent employed by it under or in connection with this Agreement
or the

 



      
 

 



 

other Transaction Documents or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) owe any fiduciary duty or have any
fiduciary responsibility to any of the holders of Common Stock or Company
Options or the Company as a result of actions taken as the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
except for such actions taken or omitted to be taken resulting from the
Shareholder Representatives gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. Provided that all payments and distributions made by or at the
direction of Shareholder Representative hereunder to the holders of Common
Stock and Company Options are made based on the good faith determination of
each such holders Pro Rata Portion or Pro Rata Adjusted Percentage, as the
case may be, thereof for each share of Common Stock or Company Option to
acquire a share of Common Stock that had been held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Shareholder Representative shall not be
liable to any holder of Common Stock or Company Options if the apportionment
with respect to such payment or distribution is subsequently determined to
have been made in error, and the sole recourse of any holder of Common Stock
or Company Options to whom such payment or distribution was due, but not made,
shall be to recover from other holders of Common Stock or Company Options, as
applicable, any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined
to have been entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If the Shareholder Representative incurs any out-of-pocket expenses
(including, without limitation, any reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)
in its capacity as Shareholder Representative under this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, such out-of-pocket expenses shall be paid
from, or reimbursed by the holders of Common Stock and Company Options ratably
in accordance with each such holders Pro Rata Adjusted Percentage thereof for
each share of Common Stock or Company Option to acquire a share of Common
Stock that had been held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective
Time and may be deducted from any amounts otherwise payable to such holders
from distributions out of the Merger Consideration Escrow Account or the
Indemnification Escrow Account.

Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. The inclusion

admission or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any
standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement.

with the other agreements, certificates and instruments referred to herein)
and the other Transaction Documents (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

for _Article III_ (on and after the Effective Time) with respect to the
holders of Common Stock and Company Options, _Article IX_ with respect to the
Parent Indemnified Parties and the Shareholder Indemnified Parties, and
_Section 6.6_ with respect to the DandO Indemnified Parties, are not intended

of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

Section 10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed

agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.10 _Service of Process_. Each party irrevocably consents to the

effect service of process on the other party by any other legally available

performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and any requirement
under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to

of this Agreement in any Action instituted in accordance with the terms
hereof.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties

Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for

failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
expressly granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of
the date first written above.
