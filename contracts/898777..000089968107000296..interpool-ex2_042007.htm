reduce the total amount of the Financing or impose any additional condition
precedent to the availability of the Financing. Parent has no reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of
Financing to be satisfied by it contained in the Equity Funding Letter or the
Commitment Letter. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees and other
fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof. Parent
shall have, and shall make available to Merger Sub, at the Closing proceeds in

Sub with acquisition financing at the Closing sufficient to (x) pay the full
amount of the Merger Consideration, the Stock Award Consideration and the

refinanced and pay all fees, penalties and premiums related thereto, and (z) pay
all expenses in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby. </FONT></P>
