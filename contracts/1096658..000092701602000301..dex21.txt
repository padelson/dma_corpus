     1.3  Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
          --------------------
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at

          ------------------------------------

          (a)  At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time the
                       --------  -------

that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be as agreed upon by Parent and
Company prior to the Effective Time.

<PAGE>

     1.5  Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
          ----------------------
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

     1.6  Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          -----------------------
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:

          (a)  Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock,
               ----------------------------------
$0.001 par value per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Sections 1.6(e) and
(f)) into the right to receive 0.425 (the "Exchange Ratio") American Depositary
Shares of Parent (the "Parent ADSs") upon surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
Section 1.9). If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent ADSs issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also
be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or
other condition, and the ADRs (as defined in Section 1.7) representing such
Parent ADSs may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The Company
shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

          (b)  Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common
               ----------------------------------
Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

          (c)  Stock Plans. At the Effective Time, all options to purchase
               -----------
Company Common Stock then outstanding under Company's 1995 Stock Plan (the "1995
Stock Plan"), Company's 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1999 Stock Plan"),
Company's 1999 Director Plan (the "Director Plan," together with the 1995 Stock
Plan and the 1999 Stock Plan, collectively the "Company Option Plans") shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8 hereof. At the Effective Time,
all rights outstanding under Company's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Company Stock Purchase Plan") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8
hereof.

          (d)  Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of Common Stock, $0.001
               ---------------------------
par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate

                                       -3-

<PAGE>

evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (e)  Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
               -----------------------------
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any share split, reverse share
split, share dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent ADSs or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Ordinary Shares (as defined in Section 3.3), Parent ADSs or Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (f)  Fractional Shares. No fraction of a Parent ADS will be issued by
               -----------------
virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Parent ADS
(after aggregating all fractional Parent ADSs that otherwise would be received
by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificates(s) (as
defined in Section 1.7(c)) receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing price of Parent ADSs for the
ten trading days immediately preceding the last full trading day prior to the
Effective Time, as reported on the Nasdaq National Market System ("Nasdaq").

     1.7  Surrender of Certificates.
          -------------------------

          (a)  Exchange Agent. Parent shall select a bank or trust company
               --------------
reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") in the Merger.

          (b)  Parent to Provide ADSs. As promptly as practicable after the
               ----------------------
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, that number of Parent ADSs as is issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d).

          (c)  Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective
               -------------------
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as
of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"),
which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
Parent ADSs pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to
Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for American Depositary Receipts ("ADRs") representing Parent ADSs,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance

                                       -4-

<PAGE>

with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor ADRs representing the number of whole
Parent ADSs into which their shares of Company Common Stock were converted at
the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence

<PAGE>

jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by
it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing

performed by it under, is not in default or violation of, and has no knowledge
of any default or violation by any other party to, each material employee
compensation, incentive, fringe or benefit plans, programs, policies, practices,
contracts, agreements, commitments or other arrangements (whether or not set
forth in a written document and including, without limitation, all "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) covering any active
or former employee, director or consultant of Parent, any subsidiary of Parent
or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is a Parent
Affiliate (the "Parent Plans"), except for such failures to perform, defaults
and violations as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each such
Parent Plan has been established, maintained and administered with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations (foreign or domestic), including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Parent Plans, except for such violations as

other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of Parent Plan activities) has been brought, or to the knowledge of Parent is

audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,
threatened by the IRS or DOL with respect to any Parent Plans that would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All contributions, reserves or premium
payments required to be made or accrued as of the date hereof to the Parent
Plans have been timely made or accrued. Any Parent Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to qualify under
Section 501(a) of the Code (i) has either obtained a favorable determination,
notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as

                                      -33-

<PAGE>

applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a remaining
period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in
which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination. For purposes of Section 3.16, a "Parent Affiliate"
means any partnership, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust,
joint venture, unincorporated organization or other entity that is a member of a
controlled group or which is under common control with Parent within the meaning
of Section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

               (b)  Neither Parent, any of its subsidiaries, nor any of the
Parent Affiliates maintains or has at any time ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and at no time has Parent or any of its
subsidiaries contributed to or been requested to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in ERISA Section 3(37) or to any
plan described in Section 413 of the Code. Neither Parent, any of its
subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
is subject to any liability or penalty under Section 4975 through 4980B of the
Code or Title I of ERISA. No "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of
Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise
exempt under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (or any
administrative class exemption issued thereunder), has occurred with respect to
any Plan.

               (c)  None of the Parent Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by
applicable law, and neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has represented,
promised or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree
benefits to any employee, former employee, director, consultant or other person,
except to the extent required by statute.

to effect the Merger. Company shall call and hold the Company Stockholders'
Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger whether or not Company's Board of Directors at any time subsequent to the
date hereof determines that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends
that Company's stockholders reject it.

     5.3  Confidentiality; Access to Information.
          --------------------------------------

          (a)  The parties acknowledge that Company and Parent have previously

full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

          (b)  Each of the Company and Parent will afford the other and the
other's accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access to its
properties, books, records and personnel during the period prior to the
Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business as such other

investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

     5.4  No Solicitation.
          ---------------

          (a)  From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time or termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its
subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment banker, attorney
or other advisor or representative retained by any of them to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), (ii) participate in

inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with
any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or

otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction (as defined below); provided,
                                                                      --------
however, that nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Board of
-------
Directors of Company in response to a Superior Offer (as defined below) from
engaging in discussions with and furnishing information to the party making such
Acquisition Proposal and withdrawing, adversely modifying or withholding its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger to the extent (A) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith after considering the advice
of its outside legal counsel that its fiduciary obligations under applicable law
require it to do so, (B) (x) at least three days prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such party, Company gives Parent written notice of Company's intention to
furnish nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations
with, such party and (y) Company receives from such

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on
the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished
to such party by or on behalf of Company, (C) contemporaneously with furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such party, Company furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent) and (D) Company has otherwise
acted in full compliance with this Section 5.4. Company and its subsidiaries
will immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal.

     For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent) relating to any
Acquisition Transaction. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition
Transaction" shall mean any transaction or series of related transactions other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement involving: (A) any
acquisition or purchase from the Company by any person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or "group" (as
defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) beneficially owning 15% or more of the total outstanding voting
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction hold less than 85% of the equity interests in the surviving or
resulting entity of such transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the
ordinary course of business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the
ordinary course of business), acquisition or disposition of more than 15% of the
assets of the Company; or (C) any liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or
other significant corporate reorganization of the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal proposing the acquisition of all of the outstanding voting
securities of the Company (x) that if any cash consideration is involved, is not
subject to any financing contingency, (y) with respect to which Company's Board
of Directors shall have determined in good faith (after considering the advice
of Company's independent financial advisors) that the acquiring party is
reasonably capable of consummating the proposed Acquisition Transaction on the
terms proposed, and (z) that Company's Board of Directors shall have determined
in good faith provides greater value to the stockholders of Company than the
Merger (after considering the advice of Company's independent financial
advisors).

         (b)   In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.4, Company as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 24 hours, shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for
information which Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which
Company reasonably should believe would lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry,
and the identity of the person or group making any such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry. Company will keep Parent informed in all material respects
of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing,

                                      -41-

<PAGE>

Company shall (i) provide Parent with at least 48 hours prior notice (or such
lesser prior notice as provided to the members of Company's Board of Directors
but in no event less than eight hours) of any meeting of Company's Board of
Directors at which Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
consider a Superior Offer and (ii) provide Parent with at least three (3)
business days prior written notice of a meeting of Company's Board of Directors
at which Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to recommend a
Superior Offer to its stockholders and together with such notice a copy of the
definitive documentation relating to such Superior Offer.

          (c)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
provided that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall be governed by
--------
the terms of Section 5.4(a) of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing
proviso, Company shall not effect any change to, modify or withdraw its
recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms of Section
5.4(a).

     5.5  Public Disclosure. Parent and Company will consult with each other and
          -----------------
agree before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal and will
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
agreement, except as may be required by law or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, in which case reasonable efforts to consult with
the other party will be made prior to any such release or public statement;
provided that the foregoing obligations shall terminate immediately following
--------
any withdrawal, modification or change by the Board of Directors of Company of
its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent
or Parent's shareholders. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press
release announcing the signing of this Agreement.

     5.6  Reasonable Efforts; Notification.
          --------------------------------

          (a)  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of commercially
reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (ii) the defending of
any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without
limiting the foregoing, Company and

                                      -42-

<PAGE>

its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or the
Parent Voting Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the Parent Voting
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement, the Parent Voting
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any
divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of
any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material limitation
on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock.

          (b)  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any representation
or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or
inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) could reasonably be expected to not be satisfied;
provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
--------  -------
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          (c)  Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any representation
or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue
or inaccurate, or any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy
in any respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) could reasonably be expected to not be
satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the
           --------  -------
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

     5.7  Third Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date
          --------------------
hereof, Parent and Company will each use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries'
respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     5.8  Stock Options; Stock Purchase Plan.
          ----------------------------------

          (a)  At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") under the Company
Option Plans, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by
Parent. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will
be (or become) exercisable for that number of whole Parent ADSs equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number of Parent ADSs) of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the per share exercise price for the Parent ADSs
issuable upon exercise of such assumed

                                      -43-

<PAGE>

Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio. Parent shall reserve a
sufficient number of shares of Parent ADSs for issuance upon exercise of the
assumed Company Stock Options.

          (b)  Company shall take all actions necessary, including, if
appropriate, amending the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan (i) to cause
the rights of participants in the Company Stock Purchase Plan with respect to
any offering period underway as of the Effective Time pursuant to the Company
Stock Purchase Plan to be determined by treating the last business day prior to
the Effective Time (or, for administrative convenience, the last day of the last
full payroll period prior to the Effective Time) as the last day of such
offering period and to prevent any offering period from commencing or occurring
after the termination of such offering period, (ii) to make such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the reduced offering period but
otherwise treating such offering period as a fully effective and completed
offering period for all purposes of the Company Stock Purchase Plan, and (iii)
to cause the Company Stock Purchase Plan and all rights of participants therein
and any other employees of the Company thereunder (except for ordinary and
necessary administrative obligations) to be terminated prior to the Effective
Time.

          (c)  Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time,
the Company and its Benefits Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any
and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements and any and all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company that such
401(k) plans shall not be terminated) (collectively, "Company Employee Plans").
Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than three
business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective as
of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of
the Company's Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take
such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Employee Plan(s)
as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that distribution or rollover of
assets from the trust of a 401(k) Plan that is terminated (or to be terminated)
is reasonably anticipated to trigger liquidation, surrender or other fees to be
paid from plan assets or by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, Company
shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of
such fees and provide such estimate to Parent at least 30 days prior to the
Effective Time.

     5.9  Employee Compensation. Each person who was an employee of the Company
          ---------------------
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, an
at-will employee of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, to the extent permitted
by applicable law (a "Continuing Employee"); provided that each employee
employed in the United States shall provide proof satisfactory to Parent of the
right to work in the United States. Arrangements with respect to compensation
and retention of specified key employees of Company shall be as set forth in
Section 5.9 of the Parent Schedule.

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

     5.10 Form S-8. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8
          --------
for the Parent ADSs issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) business days) after the Effective
Time and agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such registration
statement effective for so long as any such options remain outstanding.

     5.11 Indemnification.
          ---------------

          (a)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and any
person who served as a director or officer at any time prior to the Effective
Time in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and any indemnification
provisions under the Company Charter Documents as in effect on the date hereof.
The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at
least as favorable to the indemnified parties thereunder (the "Indemnified
Parties") as those contained in the Company Charter Documents as in effect on
the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless
such modification is required by law.

          (b)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in effect, if available, directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy on terms (including coverage) comparable to
(and not substantially less advantageous than) those applicable to the current
directors and officers of the Company; provided, however, that in no event will
                                       --------  -------
Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for
such coverage in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company.

          (c)  This Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
is intended to benefit the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified Party,
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties. Parent shall cause
SmartForce, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, to
guarantee to each person to whom the Surviving Corporation has obligations under
this Section 5.11 that the Surviving Corporation will fulfill those obligations
and agrees that each of those persons is an intended beneficiary of that
guarantee and shall have the right to enforce it against SmartForce, with regard
to himself or herself.

     5.12 Nasdaq Listing. Parent agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause the
          --------------
authorization for listing on Nasdaq of the Parent ADSs issuable, and those
required to be reserved for issuance, in connection with the Merger, upon
official notice of issuance.

     5.13 Affiliates. Set forth in Section 5.13 of the Company Schedule is a
          ----------
list of those persons who may be deemed to be, in Company's reasonable judgment,
affiliates of Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act (each, a "Company Affiliate").

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

Company will provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent
reasonably requests for purposes of reviewing such list. Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent,
as promptly as practicable on or following the date hereof, from each Company
Affiliate an executed affiliate agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C (the "Affiliate Agreement"), each of which will be in full
force and effect as of the Effective Time. Parent will be entitled to place
appropriate legends on the ADRs evidencing any Parent ADSs to be received by a
Company Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent
ADSs, consistent with the terms of the Affiliate Agreement.

     5.14 Board of Directors of Parent; Officer Appointment. Parent will cause
          -------------------------------------------------
to be taken all actions necessary to appoint the Company's current chief
executive officer (i) to the position of Chief Technology Officer of Parent
effective as of the Effective Time and (ii) to the Board of Directors of Parent
immediately after the Effective Time.

     5.15 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts. As soon as may be reasonably
          --------------------------------------
practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms relating to the
transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as
comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the Irish Merger Act or any
other merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each shall
promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be required in
order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information which
reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger
control authorities of Ireland or any other jurisdiction and which the parties
may reasonably deem appropriate; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
                                 --------  -------
required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or the Company or any of Parent's
or Company's subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of
the Company or its subsidiaries, its affiliates, or the imposition of any
material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or
to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

     5.16 Tax-Free Reorganization. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
          -----------------------
will not take any action if such action would cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Merger, (a) Parent
will cause Company to continue its historic business or use a significant
portion of its historic business assets in a business and to comply with the
reporting requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(6); and (b) Parent will not, and will not permit the Company to,
take any position in or with regard to their respective tax returns (or any
amendments thereto) that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
tax-free reorganization described in Section 368 of the Code.

     5.17 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
          ------------------
Directors of each of Parent and Company shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that (i) the assumption of Company
Stock Options held by Company Insiders (as defined below)

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent
ADSs in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, shall be
exempt transactions for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act by any
officer or director of Company who may become a covered person for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a "Company Insider").

     5.18 Benefit Plans.
          -------------

          (a)  As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall take commercially reasonable action so that employees of Company
and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in such employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements of Parent ("Parent Benefits Plans") so that each
Company employee who becomes a Parent employee is eligible for benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly-a situated
employee of Parent and its subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of
the employees of the Parent and its subsidiaries in the Parent Benefit Plans may
occur at different times with respect to different plans). To the extent
permitted under the Parent Benefits Plans, Parent shall cause each Parent
Benefit Plan in which employees of the Parent and its subsidiaries are eligible
to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
thereunder the service of such employees with Company and its subsidiaries to
the same extent such service was credited for such purposes by Company under
comparable benefit plans (but in no event shall such accounting for prior
service result in additional benefit accruals or amounts).

          (b)  If former or active employees of Company or any of its
subsidiaries become eligible to participate in a medical, dental or vision
benefits plan of Parent, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the
extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical, dental or
vision benefits plans of Parent, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible,
co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee on
or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company Employee Plan prior
to the Effective Time.

          (c)  If, in accordance with Section 5.8(c) of this Agreement, Company
is required to terminate its plan which is qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Code (the "Company 401k Plan"), the Parent hereby agrees that, subject to the
approval of the plan administrator and in accordance with the terms of the
Parent's tax-qualified 401(k) plan (the "Parent's 401(k) Plan"), Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parent's 401(k) Plan to accept
rollovers or direct rollovers of "eligible rollover distributions" within the
meaning of Section 402(c) of the Code made with respect to Company's employees
pursuant to the Company's 401(k) Plan by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Rollover amounts contributed to Parent's 401(k) Plan in
accordance with this Section 5.18(c) shall at all times be 100% vested and shall
be invested in accordance with the provisions of Parent's 401(k) Plan.

be payable pursuant to a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(b) if (a) as of the

                                    ---------

                           FORM OF AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

     THIS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of
                                     ---------
January _, 2002, by and between SmartForce PLC, a public limited company
organized under the laws of the Republic of Ireland ("Parent"), and the
                                                      ------
undersigned stockholder who may be deemed an affiliate ("Affiliate") of Centra
                                                         ---------
Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"). Capitalized terms used but
                                         -------
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Reorganization Agreement (as defined below).

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

     A.  The Company, Merger Sub (as defined below) and Parent have entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Reorganization
                                                         --------------
Agreement") which provides for the merger (the "Merger") of a wholly-owned
---------
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") with and into the Company. Pursuant to the
                       ----------
Merger, all outstanding capital stock of the Company (the "Company Capital
                                                           ---------------
Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive American Depositary Shares
-----
of Parent as described in the Reorganization Agreement;

     B.  Affiliate has been advised that Affiliate may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of the Company, as the term "affiliate" is used for purposes of Rule
145 ("Rule 145") of the Rules and Regulations promulgated under the Securities
      --------
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") by the Securities and Exchange
                              --------------
Commission (the "SEC"); and
                 ---

     C.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate is a material
inducement to Parent to enter into the Reorganization Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1.  Acknowledgments by Affiliate. Affiliate acknowledges and understands
         ----------------------------
that the representations, warranties and covenants by Affiliate set forth herein
shall be relied upon by Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates and
counsel, and that substantial losses and damages may be incurred by these
persons if Affiliate's representations, warranties or covenants are breached.
Affiliate has carefully read this Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement and
has discussed the requirements of this Agreement with Affiliate's professional
advisors, who are qualified to advise Affiliate with regard to such matters.

     2.  Beneficial Ownership of Company Capital Stock. The Affiliate is the
         ---------------------------------------------
sole record and beneficial owner of the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock set forth next to its name on the signature page hereto (the "Shares").
                                                                    ------
Except for Shares subject to a margin agreement or similar agreement, there are
no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character,

<PAGE>

written or oral, to which Affiliate is party or by which it is bound obligating
Affiliate to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any Shares or obligating Affiliate to
grant or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or
agreement. The Shares constitute all shares of Company Capital Stock owned,
beneficially or of record, by the Affiliate. The Shares are not subject to
preemptive rights created by any agreement to which Affiliate is party.
Affiliate has not engaged in any sale or other transfer of the Shares in
contemplation of the Merger.

     3.   Compliance with Rule 145 and the Securities Act.
          -----------------------------------------------

          (a) Affiliate has been advised that (i) the issuance of Parent ADSs in
connection with the Merger is expected to be effected pursuant to a registration
statement on Form S-4, and the resale of such shares shall be subject to
restrictions set forth in Rule 145, and (ii) Affiliate may be deemed to be an
affiliate of the Company as defined by paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145.
Affiliate accordingly agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
American Depositary Shares ("Parent ADSs") issued to Affiliate in the Merger
unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with
the requirements of Rule 145(d)(1) and, to the extent required by the terms of
the Deposit Agreement (as defined below), Rule 144(h), or (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act or an appropriate exemption from
registration, or (iii) Affiliate delivers to Parent a written opinion of
counsel, reasonably acceptable to Parent in form and substance, that such sale,
transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the
Securities Act. Affiliate acknowledges that the Parent ADSs issued to Affiliate
in the Merger will be deposited in a restricted ADR (as defined below) facility
pursuant to that certain Deposit Agreement, dated as of November 30, 1995, as
amended and restated as of May 22, 1998, among Parent, The Bank of New York and
all owners and beneficial owners from time to time of restricted ADRs issued
thereunder (the "Deposit Agreement") and that, pursuant to the Deposit
Agreement, among other things, except as provided in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence, sales of Parent ADSs issued to Affiliate in the Merger may
only be effected pursuant to Rule 145(d)(1). In addition to any other
requirements of this Agreement, Affiliate agrees to comply with the requirements
of Rule 144(h) with respect to the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent
ADSs acquired by Affiliate in the Merger to the extent required by the terms of
the Deposit Agreement.

          (b) Parent shall give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent
with respect to any Parent ADSs received by Affiliate pursuant to the Merger and
there shall be placed on the American Depositary Receipt ("ADR") representing
                                                           ---
such Parent ADSs, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

          "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A
          TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT APPLIES AND MAY
          ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145(d)(1) OR PURSUANT TO
          AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
          AS AMENDED, OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF COUNSEL,
          REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH

                                                                             -2-

<PAGE>

          TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
          AS AMENDED."

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute ADR
without such legend) and Parent shall so instruct its transfer agent, if
Affiliate delivers to Parent (i) written evidence satisfactory to Parent that
the shares have been sold in compliance with Rule 145(d)(1) (in which case, the
substitute ADR shall be issued in the name of the transferee), or (ii) an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that public sale of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer
subject to Rule 145.

          (c) Affiliate understands that unless a sale or transfer is made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a registration
statement, Parent reserves the right to put the following legend on the ADRs
issued to his transferee:

          "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ACQUIRED FROM A
          PERSON WHO RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145
          PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE
          BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN
          CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
          SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
          TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
          REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
          (THE "SECURITIES" ACT) OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN OPINION OF
          COUNSEL, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE,
          THAT SUCH SALE, PLEDGE OR TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER
          THE SECURITIES ACT."

     4.   No Obligation to Register. Affiliate understands that Parent is under
          -------------------------
no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Parent
ADSs by or on Affiliate's behalf under the Act or, to take any other action
necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.

     5.   Termination. This Agreement shall automatically terminate and shall be
          -----------
of no further force and effect in the event of the termination of the
Reorganization Agreement pursuant to Article VII of the Reorganization
Agreement.

     6.   Miscellaneous.
          -------------

          (a)  Waiver; Severability. No waiver by any party hereto of any
               --------------------
condition or of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by each party hereto. In the event that any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any
person, entity or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid,
unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement,
and the application of such

                                                                             -3-

<PAGE>

provision to persons, entities or circumstances other than those as to which it
is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be
impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

          (b)  Binding Effect and Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
               -----------------------------
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by either
of the parties without prior written consent of the other party hereto.

          (c)  Amendments and Modification. This Agreement may not be modified,
               ---------------------------
amended, altered or supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a
written agreement executed by the parties hereto.

          (d)  Injunctive Relief. Each of the parties acknowledge that (i) the
               -----------------
covenants and the restrictions contained in this Agreement are necessary,
fundamental, and required for the protection of Parent and the Company; (ii)
such covenants relate to matters which are of a special, unique, and
extraordinary character that gives each of such covenants a special, unique, and
extraordinary value; and (iii) a breach of any such covenants or any other
provision of this Agreement shall result in irreparable harm and damages to
Parent and the Company which cannot be adequately compensated by a monetary
award. Accordingly, it is expressly agreed that in addition to all other
remedies available at law or in equity, Parent and the Company shall be entitled
to the immediate remedy of a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction, or such other form of injunctive or equitable relief as may be used
by any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain or enjoin any of the parties
hereto from breaching any such covenant or provision or to specifically enforce
the provisions hereof.

          (e)  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed,
               -------------
interpreted and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

          (f)  Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire
               ----------------
understanding of Affiliate and Parent relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between Affiliate and Parent
relating to the subject matter hereof.

          (g)  Attorneys' Fees. In the event of any legal actions or proceeding

a final judgment.

          (h)  Further Assurances. Affiliate shall execute and/or cause to be
               ------------------
delivered to Parent such instruments and other documents and shall take such
other actions as Parent may reasonably request to effectuate the intent and
purposes of this Agreement.

                                                                             -4-
