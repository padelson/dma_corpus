 **ARTICLE II 
EFFECT ON RMP UNITS AND RMP INCENTIVE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of RMP Units and Cancellation of RMP Incentive
Distribution Rights_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the parties or the holder of any securities
of or interests in the parties:

 



 

(a) _Conversion of RMP Units_. Subject to _Section 2.2(h)_ and _Section
2.4_, each RMP Unit issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding in
accordance with _Section 2.3_ as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive 0.3319 (the " ** _Exchange
Ratio_** ") EQM Units (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "), subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.4_, which EQM Units will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required under the EQM
Partnership Agreement) and non-assessable (except as set forth in the EQM
Partnership Agreement or as such non-assessability may be affected by matters
described in Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of RMP Incentive Distribution Rights_. The RMP Incentive
Distribution Rights (as defined herein) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist. In
connection with such cancellation, EQT EQGP shall retain its rights to any
capital account in RMP associated, as of immediately prior to the Merger, with
the RMP Incentive Distribution Rights acquired by EQGP pursuant to the IDR
Purchase and Sale Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Book-Entry Unit and Certificates_. As of the Effective Time, all RMP
Units converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of RMP Units in book-entry form (" ** _Book-
Entry Units_** ") or a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any RMP Units (a " ** _Certificated Unit_** ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.2(g)_, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such RMP Unit in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_,
without interest, and the right to be admitted as an EQM Limited Partner. Upon
such surrender of a RMP Unit in accordance with this Agreement and the
recording of the name of such Person as a limited partner of EQM on the books
and records of EQM, such Person shall automatically and effective as of the
Effective Time be admitted as an EQM Limited Partner and be bound by the EQM
Partnership Agreement as such. By its acceptance of EQM Units, an RMP
Unitholder confirms its agreement to be bound by all of the terms and
conditions of the EQM Partnership Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, EQM shall appoint an exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to RMP (the " ** _Exchange Agent_** ") for the
purpose of exchanging Certificated Units and Book-Entry Units for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but
in no event more than five business days following the Effective Time, EQM
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
of RMP Units as of the Effective Time a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificated Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Units to the Exchange
Agent) in such forms as EQM and RMP may reasonably agree, including
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificated Units (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Units to the
Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, EQM shall cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of RMP Units,
an amount of EQM Units (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form)
issuable upon due surrender of the Certificated Units (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_. Following the Effective Time, EQM agrees to make available
to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_ and any EQM
Units sufficient to pay any Merger Consideration, in each case, that may be
payable from time to time following the Effective Time. All book-entry units
representing EQM Units deposited with, and cash made available to, the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Agent (including pursuant to _Section 2.2(h)_) shall be referred to
in this Agreement as the " ** _Exchange Fund_**." The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_ and such
distributions as a holder of RMP Units may be entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.2(g) out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in
the Exchange Fund as directed by EQM; _provided_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of RMP
Units and EQM shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of RMP Units in the amount of any
such losses.

 



 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of RMP Units that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange
Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, a certificate (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) representing each Certificated
Unit, or Book-Entry Unit and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the number of EQM Units representing, in the aggregate, (i) the whole
number of EQM Units that such holder has the right to receive in accordance
with the provisions of this _Article II_ and (ii) a check in the amount of
such distributions as such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.2(g)_. The Merger Consideration and such other amounts as
reflected in the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid as promptly as
practicable after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) representing each Certificated
Unit or Book-Entry Units and letter of transmittal in accordance with the
foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or
on any unpaid distributions payable to holders of RMP Units. Until so
surrendered, each such RMP Unit shall, after the Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of Certificated Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the RMP Units.

 



 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any payment is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificated Unit (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit is
registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason
of the making of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
the surrendered Certificated Unit (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Unit or shall establish to the satisfaction of EQM and
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a
Person other than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered
Certificated Unit (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Unit is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof
that any surrendered certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the
Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
similar Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificated Unit (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Unit or establish
to the satisfaction of EQM and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be
no further registration on the books of RMP of transfers of RMP Units. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificated Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such RMP Units except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificated Units (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units are presented to the
Exchange Agent or EQM, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in, this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the RMP Unitholders 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to EQM, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged such holders RMP Units for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section 2.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Entity for delivery of the Merger Consideration in respect of such
holders RMP Units. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EQM, RMP and the Surviving
Entity shall not be liable to any RMP Unitholder for any Merger Consideration
duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property
Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by RMP Unitholders
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of EQM free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Distributions_. No distributions with respect to EQM Units issued in the
Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificated Units (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units until such
Certificated Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.2_. Following such
surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law,
there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the EQM Units,
if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all
distributions payable in respect of any such EQM Units with a record date
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the distributions payable with respect to such EQM Units with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.
For purposes of distributions in respect of EQM Units, all EQM Units to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to distributions pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Units_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
EQM Units shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificated
Units (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all fractional EQM
Units that a holder of RMP Units converted pursuant to the Merger would
otherwise be entitled to receive as Merger Consideration in the Merger (after
taking into account all Certificated Units (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Units) will be aggregated and then, if a
fractional EQM Unit results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the
nearest whole EQM Unit.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any certificate representing
a Certificated Unit shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by EQM, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as EQM may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificated Unit,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the RMP Units
represented by such certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_ and pay
any distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(g)_.

 



 

(j) _Withholding Taxes_. EQM, RMP and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding is required,
such deduction and withholding may be taken in EQM Units). To the extent
amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.
If withholding is taken in EQM Units, EQM and the Exchange Agent shall be
treated as having sold such EQM Units for an amount of cash equal to the fair
market value of such EQM Units at the time of such deemed sale and paid such
cash proceeds to the appropriate Tax authority.

 



 

(k) _Tax Characterization of Merger_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax
purposes, (i) the Merger is intended to be treated as an "assets-over"
partnership merger transaction under Treasury Regulations Sections
1.708-1(c)(1) and 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), whereby RMP is intended to be the
terminating partnership and EQM is intended to be the resulting partnership,
and as a result, the Merger shall be treated for U.S. federal (and applicable
state and local) income tax purposes as (A) a contribution of all of the
assets and liabilities of RMP to EQM in exchange for partnership interests in
EQM, immediately followed by (B) a liquidating distribution by RMP of such
partnership interests in EQM to the partners of RMP as of immediately prior to
the Merger and (ii) none of EQM, RMP, any holder of EQM Units or other
partnership interest in EQM, or any holder of RMP Units or other partnership
interest in RMP is intended to recognize taxable gain (other than any gain
resulting from (A) any actual or constructive distribution of cash or other
property or (B) any decrease in partnership liabilities pursuant to Section
752 of the Code) (the " ** _Intended Tax Treatment_** "). Unless required to
do so as a result of a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code, each of the parties hereto agrees not to make any Tax filings or
otherwise take any position inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment and
to cooperate with the other party to make any filings, statements, or reports
required to effect, disclose or report the Intended Tax Treatment.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of RMP Phantom Units_. Each award of phantom units in
respect of RMP Units (each, an " ** _RMP Phantom Unit Award_** ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any such RMP Phantom Unit Award, be fully vested and

 



      
 

 



 

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to
applicable tax withholding, in respect of each RMP Unit subject thereto.
Effective as of no later than the Effective Time, the RMP GP Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering any RMP Equity Plans) and the EQM GP
Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take
any other actions that may be reasonably necessary to effect the provisions of
this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding RMP Units or EQM Units shall have been changed into a different
number of units or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record
date of any unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of such unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of
units or similar transaction and to provide the holders of RMP Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

Section 2.5 _No Dissenters  or Appraisal Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Merger, the GP Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE RMP ENTITIES**

 



 

Except as disclosed in (a) the RMP SEC Documents filed or publicly furnished
with the SEC on or after December 31, 2016 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (but excluding any disclosure contained in any such RMP SEC
Documents under the heading "Risk Factors" or "Cautionary Statements" or
similar heading (other than any factual information contained within such
headings, disclosure or statements)) or (b) the disclosure letter delivered by
RMP to EQM (the " ** _RMP Disclosure Schedule_** ") prior to the execution of
this Agreement ( _provided_ that (i) disclosure in any section of such RMP
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other
section of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other section
notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross reference thereto and
(ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such RMP Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be
expected to have, an RMP Material Adverse Effect), the RMP Entities hereby
represent and warrant to EQM as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 



 

(a) Each of the RMP Entities and their respective Subsidiaries is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, formed or organized, as
applicable, and has all requisite partnership, corporate, limited liability
company or other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where

 



      
 

 



 

the failure to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on RMP (an " ** _RMP Material
Adverse Effect_** ").

 



 

(b) Each of the RMP Entities and their respective Subsidiaries is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have an RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.1(c)_ of the RMP Disclosure Schedule,
all of the outstanding partnership interests, limited liability company
interests, shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each
material Subsidiary of RMP that are owned directly or indirectly by RMP have
been duly authorized and validly issued in accordance with the organizational
documents of each such entity (in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) and are fully paid (in the case of an interest in a limited
partnership or limited liability company, to the extent required under the
organizational documents of such entity) and nonassessable (to the extent such
Subsidiary is a corporate entity) and are owned free and clear of all liens,
pledges, charges, mortgages, encumbrances, options, rights of first refusal or
other preferential purchase rights, adverse rights or claims and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (including any restriction on the
right to vote or transfer the same, except for such transfer restrictions as
set forth in the organizational documents of such Subsidiary and for such
transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " ** _Securities Act_** "), and the "blue sky" laws of the
various States of the United States) (collectively, " ** _Liens_** "). All
such interests and shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are owned
directly or indirectly by RMP.

 



 

(d) RMP has made available to EQM correct and complete copies of its
certificate of limited partnership and the RMP Partnership Agreement (the " **
_RMP Charter Documents_** "), and correct and complete copies of the

the date of this Agreement. All such RMP Charter Documents, RMP Subsidiary
Documents and RMP GP Charter Documents are in full force and effect and none
of RMP, its material Subsidiaries and RMP GP is in violation of any of their
provisions.

 



 

(e) RMP GP has not engaged in business, activity or operations other than
acting as general partner of RMP, and RMP GP has no assets (other than the RMP
GP Interest). RMP GP has no liabilities of any nature (whether or not accrued
or contingent) other than liabilities incurred as a matter of law by virtue of
acting as general partner of RMP. RMP GP is not a party to any document or

subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or exchangeable
securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character providing for
the issuance of any RMP Partnership Interests or other partnership interests,
voting securities or other equity interests of RMP, including any representing
the right to purchase or otherwise receive any of the foregoing.

Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.5 _RMP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) RMP and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since
December 31, 2016 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " ** _RMP SEC Documents_** "). The RMP SEC Documents,
as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the RMP SEC Documents
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all

 



      
 

 



 

other RMP SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date
of this Agreement, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " **
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_** "), as the case may be, applicable to such RMP SEC
Documents, and none of the RMP SEC Documents as of such respective dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the RMP SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of RMP, none of the RMP SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of RMP included in the RMP SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of RMP and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash
flows and changes in partners capital for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to RMP and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

 



 

(c) RMP has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
RMP, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by RMP
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to RMPs principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by RMP in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. RMPs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation, to RMPs auditors and the audit committee of the
RMP GP Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which could adversely affect RMPs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for RMPs auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls
over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in RMPs
internal controls over financial reporting. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of RMP have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the RMP SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of RMP has completed

 



      
 

 



 

its assessment of the effectiveness of RMPs internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of RMP, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer from giving the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of RMP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 (the " ** _Balance Sheet
Date_** ") (including the notes thereto) included in the RMP SEC Documents
filed by RMP and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither RMP nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent) that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of RMP prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither RMP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among RMP and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, RMP in RMPs published financial statements or any RMP SEC
Documents.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an RMP Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, RMP and its Subsidiaries have carried on and
operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither RMP nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in _Section 5.2(a)_ that,
if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
without the prior written consent of EQM, would violate such provisions.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of RMP, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to RMP, RMP GP or any of their Subsidiaries or actions,
suits or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of RMP, threatened) against
RMP, RMP GP or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and

 



      
 

 



 

there are no orders, judgments, decrees or similar rulings of any Governmental
Authority against RMP, RMP GP or any of their Subsidiaries, in each case
except for those that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.8 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 



 

(a) RMP, RMP GP and their Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December
31, 2015 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or
organization have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial
law, statute, tariff, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, stipulation, determination, award or decree or agency requirement
of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority, including common law
(collectively, " ** _Laws_** " and each, a " ** _Law_** "), except where such
non-compliance, default or violation would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) RMP, RMP GP and their Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits
(including Environmental Permits) necessary for RMP, RMP GP and their
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry
on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " ** _RMP Permits_**
"), except where the failure to have any of the RMP Permits would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse Effect. All RMP
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an RMP
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the RMP
Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of RMP, threatened, except where such
suspension or cancellation would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
an RMP Material Adverse Effect. RMP, RMP GP and their Subsidiaries are not,
and since December 31, 2015 have not been, in violation or breach of, or
default under, any RMP Permit, except where such violation, breach or default
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of RMP, no event or
condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach,
default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of RMP,
RMP GP or any of their Subsidiaries under, any RMP Permit, or has caused (or
would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue,
renew or extend any RMP Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses,
accelerations or failures that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 3.8(a)_, none of RMP, its
Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of RMP, any consultant, agent or
representative of any of the foregoing (in their respective capacities as
such), (i) has violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other
U.S. and foreign anti-corruption Laws that are applicable to RMP or its
Subsidiaries; (ii) has, to the knowledge of RMP, been given written notice by
any Governmental Authority of any facts which, if true, would constitute a
violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other U.S. or
foreign anti-corruption Laws by any such person; and (iii) to the knowledge of
RMP, is being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority
except, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a RMP Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.9 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied (or to be
supplied) in writing by or on behalf of RMP specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC by EQM in connection with the issuance of EQM Units in
connection with the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" ** _Registration Statement_** ") will, at the time the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at
the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading, and (b) the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed
to RMP Unitholders, and at the time of the RMP Unitholders Meeting, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

applicable, and has all requisite partnership, corporate, limited liability
company or other applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all

Section 4.5 _EQM SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) EQM and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all reports, schedules,
forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other
statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since
December 31, 2016 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each case
including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, the " ** _EQM SEC Documents_** "). The EQM SEC Documents,
as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the EQM SEC Documents
that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all other EQM SEC Documents), or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the
date of this Agreement, complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, as the case may be, applicable to such EQM SEC Documents, and none of the
EQM SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from
the SEC staff with respect to the EQM SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of EQM,
none of the EQM SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of EQM included in the EQM SEC
Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the last
such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of EQM and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations, cash
flows and changes in equity for the periods then ended (subject,

 



      
 

 



 

in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to EQM and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

 



 

(c) EQM has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
EQM, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by EQM
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to EQMs principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by EQM in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. EQMs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation, to EQMs auditors and the audit committee of the
EQM GP Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting which could adversely affect EQMs
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for EQMs auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls
over financial reporting and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in EQMs
internal controls over financial reporting. The principal executive officer
and the principal financial officer of EQM have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the EQM SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of EQM has completed its assessment of the effectiveness
of EQMs internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2017, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of EQM, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no facts or circumstances that would prevent its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

 



 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of EQM and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date
(including the notes thereto) included in the EQM SEC Documents filed by EQM
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither EQM nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent) that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of EQM prepared in accordance with GAAP or the
notes thereto, other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Neither EQM nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among EQM and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, EQM in EQMs published financial statements or any EQM SEC
Documents.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 



 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been an EQM Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(b) Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) except for this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, EQM and its consolidated Subsidiaries have
carried on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii)
neither EQM nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in
_Section 5.2(b)_ that, if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time without the prior written consent of RMP, would violate
such provisions.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no investigations or proceedings
pending (or, to the Knowledge of EQM, threatened) by any Governmental
Authority with respect to EQM, EQM GP or any of their Subsidiaries or actions,

EQM, EQM GP or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there
are no orders, judgments, decrees or similar rulings of any Governmental
Authority against EQM, EQM GP or any of their Subsidiaries, in each case

(a) EQM, EQM GP and their Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December
31, 2015 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or
organization have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any applicable Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or
violation would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) EQM, EQM GP and their Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits
(including Environmental Permits) necessary for EQM, EQM GP and their
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry

"), except where the failure to have any of the EQM Permits would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse Effect. All EQM
Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or

 



      
 

 



 

cancellation of any of the EQM Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of EQM,
threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse Effect. EQM, EQM GP
and their Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2015 have not been, in
violation or breach of, or default under, any EQM Permit, except where such
violation, breach or default would not have, individually or in the aggregate,
an EQM Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, to the
Knowledge of EQM, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would
result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of EQM, EQM GP or any of their Subsidiaries
under, any EQM Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable
Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend any EQM
Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both), except
for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or failures that
would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse
Effect.

Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of EQM, any consultant, agent or

such), (i) has violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any other
U.S. and foreign anti-corruption Laws that are applicable to EQM or its
Subsidiaries; (ii) has, to the knowledge of EQM, been given written notice by

EQM, is being (and has not been) investigated by any Governmental Authority
except, in each case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), as would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) None of EQM or any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities under the WARN
Act that would have, individually or in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse
Effect. Except for such non-compliance which would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, an EQM Material Adverse Effect, EQM and each of its
Subsidiaries is, and during the two year period preceding the date of this
Agreement has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws in respect of
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages

supplied) in writing by or on behalf of EQM specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed
with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act,

dissolution, restructuring, recapitalization or other reorganization (other
than transactions exclusively between wholly owned Subsidiaries of EQM);

 



 

(v) engage in any activity or conduct its business in a manner that would
cause less than 90% of the gross income of EQM for any calendar quarter since
its formation and prior to the Effective Time to be treated as "qualifying
income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code or that would
otherwise cause EQM to be taxable as a corporation under Section 7704 of the
Code;

 



 

(vi) make, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to make, any acquisition of any
other Person or business or merge, consolidate or enter into any other
business combination transaction or agreement with any Person, in each case,
that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger or the GP Merger;

 



 

(vii) file a registration statement relating to the primary offering, issuance
and sale of EQM Units by EQM; or

 



 

(viii) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

 



 

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation by RMP_.

 



 

(a) RMP shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause RMPs and its Subsidiaries respective directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, " **
_Representatives_** ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to an RMP Alternative Proposal, request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of RMP or its Subsidiaries and immediately prohibit any access by any Person
(other than EQM and its Representatives) to any physical or electronic data
room relating to a possible RMP Alternative Proposal. Except as permitted by
this _Section 5.3_, (x) without the prior written consent of EQM, RMP shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by way
of furnishing confidential information) or knowingly induce or take any other
action intended to lead to any inquiries or any proposals that constitute or
could reasonably be expected to lead to an RMP Alternative Proposal, (ii)
grant any waiver or release of any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any units of RMP or of any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) enter into
any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement
in principle, unit purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or unit
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to an
RMP Alternative Proposal, (iv) file with the SEC a Proxy Statement that does
not include the RMP Board Recommendation, or (v) withdraw, modify or qualify,
or

 



      
 

 



 

propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to EQM,
the RMP Board Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption
of, or publicly approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or
adopt, any RMP Alternative Proposal, or fail to recommend against acceptance
of any tender offer or exchange offer for RMP Units within ten (10) business
days after commencement of such offer, or resolving or agreeing to take any of
the foregoing actions, and (y) subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, within five
business days of receipt of a written request of EQM following the receipt by
RMP of any RMP Alternative Proposal, RMP shall publicly reconfirm the RMP
Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that EQM shall not be permitted to make
such request on more than one occasion in respect of each RMP Alternative
Proposal and each material modification to an RMP Alternative Proposal, if any
(the taking of any action described in clauses (x)(iv) or (v) or the failure
to take the action described in clause (y) being referred to as an " ** _RMP
Adverse Recommendation Change_** "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by RMPs
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by RMP, other than in the case where (x) such breach is a
result of an isolated action by a Person that is a Representative of RMP
(other than a director or officer of RMP or RMP GP), (y) such breach was not
caused by, or within the Knowledge of, RMP and (z) RMP takes appropriate
actions to remedy such breach upon discovery thereof.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
RMP Unitholder Approval, (i) RMP has received an unsolicited written RMP
Alternative Proposal that the RMP GP Board (upon the recommendation of the RMP
Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide, (ii) the RMP GP Board (upon the
recommendation of the RMP Conflicts Committee), after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that
(A) such RMP Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to or result in an RMP Superior Proposal and (B) failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law as modified
by the RMP Partnership Agreement and (iii) such RMP Alternative Proposal did
not result from a Willful Breach of this _Section 5.3_, then RMP may, subject
to clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information, including confidential
information, with respect to RMP and its Subsidiaries to the Person making
such RMP Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such RMP Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) RMP
will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
not to, disclose any non-public information to such Person unless RMP has, or
first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with such Person of the nature
generally used in similar circumstances, as determined by RMP in its
reasonable business judgment and (y) RMP will provide to EQM non-public
information about RMP or its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or
made available to EQM prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or
making available such non-public information to such other Person.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of RMP set forth in this _Section
5.3_, RMP shall promptly advise EQM, orally and in writing, and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other
contact is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, RMP in respect
of any RMP Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to EQM,
indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact and the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep EQM reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and RMP shall promptly provide
EQM with copies of any additional written materials received by RMP or that
RMP has delivered to any third party making an RMP Alternative Proposal that
relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of
any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the RMP Unitholder Approval, the RMP GP Board and the RMP
Conflicts Committee may effect an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an unsolicited RMP Alternative Proposal or an Intervening Event if
the RMP GP Board (upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts Committee),
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law as modified by the RMP
Partnership Agreement and:

 



 

(i) if the RMP GP Board (upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts
Committee) intends to effect such RMP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an RMP Alternative Proposal:

 



 

(A) such RMP Alternative Proposal is bona fide, in writing and has not been
withdrawn or abandoned;

 



 

(B) the RMP GP Board (upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts Committee)
has determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such RMP Alternative Proposal constitutes an RMP
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments offered by EQM
pursuant to clause (E) below;

 



 

(C) RMP has provided prior written notice to EQM in accordance with _Section
8.9_ (the " ** _RMP Superior Proposal Notice_** ") of the RMP GP Boards
intention to effect an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change, and such RMP
Superior Proposal Notice has specified the identity of the Person making such
RMP Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such RMP
Alternative Proposal, and complete copies of any written proposal or offers
(including proposed agreements) received by RMP in connection with such RMP
Alternative Proposal;

 



 

(D) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the RMP
Superior Proposal Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_ and
ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that is the fourth calendar day
following the date of such delivery (the " ** _RMP Superior Proposal Notice
Period_** "), RMP shall (1) negotiate with EQM in good faith to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure
to effect such RMP Adverse Recommendation Change would not be inconsistent

 



      
 

 



 

with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by the RMP Partnership
Agreement; and (2) keep EQM reasonably informed with respect to the status and
changes in the material terms and conditions of such RMP Alternative Proposal
or other change in circumstances related thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any material revisions to such RMP Alternative Proposal (it being agreed
that any change in the purchase price in such RMP Alternative Proposal shall
be deemed a material revision) shall require delivery of a subsequent RMP
Superior Proposal Notice and a subsequent RMP Superior Proposal Notice Period
in respect of such revised RMP Alternative Proposal, except that such
subsequent RMP Superior Proposal Notice Period shall expire upon the later of
(x) the end of the initial RMP Superior Proposal Notice Period and (y) 11:59
p.m. Eastern time on the date that is the second calendar day following the
date of the delivery of such subsequent RMP Superior Proposal Notice; and

 



 

(E) the RMP GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement offered in writing by EQM and, at the end of the RMP Superior
Proposal Notice Period, shall have determined in good faith that (i) such RMP
Alternative Proposal continues to constitute an RMP Superior Proposal even if
such revisions were to be given effect and (ii) failure to effect an RMP
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law as modified by the RMP Partnership Agreement even if such
revisions were to be given effect; or

 



 

(ii) if the RMP GP Board (upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts
Committee) intends to effect such RMP Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event:

 



 

(A) RMP shall provide prior written notice to EQM in accordance with _Section
8.9_ (the " ** _RMP Recommendation Change Notice_** ") of the RMP GP Boards
intention to effect an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change, and such RMP
Recommendation Change Notice shall specify the details of such Intervening
Event and the reasons for the RMP Adverse Recommendation Change;

 



 

(B) during the period that commences on the date of delivery of the RMP
Recommendation Change Notice as determined in accordance with _Section 8.9_
and ends at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on the date that is the fifth calendar
day following the date of such delivery, RMP shall (i) negotiate with EQM in
good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the failure to effect such RMP Adverse Recommendation Change
would not be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law, as modified by
the RMP Partnership Agreement; and (ii) keep EQM reasonably informed of any
change in circumstances related thereto; and

 



 

(C) the RMP GP Board shall have considered all revisions to the terms of this
Agreement offered in writing by EQM and, at the end of the RMP Adverse
Recommendation Change Notice Period, shall have determined

 



      
 

 



 

(upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts Committee) in good faith that
the failure to effect an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law as modified by the RMP
Partnership Agreement even if such revisions were to be given effect.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent RMP or the RMP GP Board
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to an RMP Alternative Proposal if the RMP GP Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a violation of
applicable Law; _provided_ that any RMP Adverse Recommendation Change may only
be made in accordance with _Section 5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a
public statement that describes RMPs receipt of an RMP Alternative Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed
an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_), the EQM Entities, on the one hand, and the RMP Entities, on the
other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing
to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain
as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date)
all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, including by
Governmental Authorities, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or seek to have lifted or rescinded any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability
of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
obtain all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing (if required) of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly
as practicable and in any event within 15 business days after the date of this
Agreement or after any later date on which the parties agree that there is an
HSR Act filing requirement (unless a later date is mutually agreed to by the
parties hereto) and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental
Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust

 



      
 

 



 

Law and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken
(including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent
with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and to obtain approvals or
consents under any other applicable Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date); and (ii) EQM and RMP shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to (A) take all actions necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, take all actions necessary to ensure that such
transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the transaction.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission with a
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by providing the other parties a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Authority and any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other party to
review in advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any
communication or submission to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any approvals, consents, clearances or expirations
or terminations of waiting periods required under any Antitrust Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) consult with the
other party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any
other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and teleconferences. Subject to _Section
5.6(b)_, the parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
_Section 5.4_ in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) The EQM Entities and the RMP Entities (including by causing their
respective Subsidiaries) agree to use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
resolve any objections that a Governmental Authority or other Person may
assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, so as to enable the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the
Outside Date, including (A) offering, negotiating, accepting and agreeing to
dispose or hold separate any part of the EQM Entities, the RMP Entities or
their respective Subsidiaries businesses, operations or assets (or a
combination thereof) or (B) offering, negotiating, accepting and agreeing to
restrict the manner in which the EQM Entities, the RMP Entities or any of
their respective Subsidiaries may carry on business in

 



      
 

 



 

any part of the world (the actions described in subsections (ii)(A) and
(ii)(B) together, " ** _Remedial Actions_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the EQM
Entities, the RMP Entities and their Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall not be
required to take any Remedial Action, take any other action, or enter into any
other agreement if such Remedial Action or other action or agreement,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse impact on (x) the EQM Entities and their Subsidiaries, prior
to the Merger, taken as a whole, (y) the RMP Entities and their Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (z) the EQM Entities and their Subsidiaries, after the
Merger, taken as a whole. Neither the EQM Entities nor the RMP Entities shall,
without the other parties prior written consent, offer, negotiate, accept or
agree to any Remedial Action or other action or agreement with respect to the
EQM Entities or the RMP Entities businesses, operations or assets, or any
restrictions on their businesses.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by EQM and RMP. Thereafter, neither EQM nor RMP shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NYSE or other
national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the
party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue
or cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other party); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that RMP shall not be required by this _Section 5.5_ to consult with any
other party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of an RMP Alternative Proposal that the RMP GP Board
(upon the recommendation of the RMP Conflicts Committee) believes is bona fide
and matters related thereto or an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change but
nothing in this proviso shall limit any obligation of RMP under _Section
5.3(d)_ to negotiate with EQM in good faith; _provided_ , _further_ , that
each party and their respective controlled affiliates may make statements that
are consistent with statements made in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by EQM or RMP in compliance with this
_Section 5.5_.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
commitments, books, Contracts, records and correspondence (in each case,
whether in physical or electronic form), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives; provided, that such
access shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to the
operations of the requested party and its Representatives. Each party shall
furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule and
other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including
"comment letters") received by such party from the SEC

 



      
 

 



 

concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the
other party may reasonably request (including information necessary to prepare
the Proxy Statement). Each party and its Representatives shall hold
information received from the other party pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ in
confidence.

 



 

(b) This _Section 5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel) adversely affect in any
material respect such partys position in any pending or, what such party
believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel) could be, future
litigation or (ii) if such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse
parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto;
_provided_ that, in the case of clause (i), the parties hereto shall cooperate
in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (A)
would not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract
or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which appropriately designated
Representatives of the other party shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being requested to
disclose the information shall (1) notify the other party that such
disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (2) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 5.6(b)_) and (3) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 



 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. RMP shall give prompt notice to
EQM, and EQM shall give prompt notice to RMP, of (i) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such

 



       
 

 



 

communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent is
reasonably likely to be material to RMP or EQM, (ii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VI_ and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_; _provided_ that, in the
case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the failure to comply with this _Section 5.7_
shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VI_, or give rise to any right to terminate this
Agreement under _Article VII_, if the underlying fact, circumstance, event or
failure would not in and of itself give rise to such failure or right.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, (i) " ** _Indemnified Person_** "
shall mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to
the Effective Time, an officer or director of RMP, RMP GP or any of their
respective Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their
capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or
other employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with RMP) serving at the request of or on behalf of
RMP or RMP GP or any of their respective Subsidiaries and together with such
Persons heirs, executors or administrators and (ii) " ** _Proceeding_** "
shall mean any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation or regulatory
action.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that RMP, RMP GP
or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would be permitted to indemnify an
Indemnified Person, EQM and EQM GP agree to (i) indemnify and hold harmless
against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) in connection with any
Proceeding, and provide advancement promptly, and in any event within 10 days
after any written request, of expenses to, all Indemnified Persons to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii) honor the provisions
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the RMP
Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of RMP GP and any
Subsidiary of RMP or RMP GP immediately prior to the Effective Time and ensure
that the organizational documents of the Surviving Entity and the Surviving GP
Entity shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of present and former directors, officers and agents
of RMP, RMP GP and their respective Subsidiaries than are presently set forth
in the RMP Charter Documents and comparable governing instruments of RMP GP.
Any right of indemnification of

 



      
 

 



 

an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Entity and the Surviving GP Entity shall maintain in effect
for six years from the Effective Time RMPs and RMP GPs current directors
and officers liability insurance policies covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to Indemnified
Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Entity or the Surviving GP Entity may
substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Entity or the Surviving GP Entity be required to expend pursuant to
this _Section 5.8(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by RMP or RMP GP for such insurance (the " ** _Maximum
Amount_** "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Entity or the Surviving GP Entity would be
required to expend more than the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity or the
Surviving GP Entity shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance as is
available for the Maximum Amount. If RMP in its sole discretion elects, then,
in lieu of the obligations of EQM and the Surviving Entity or the Surviving GP
Entity under this _Section 5.8(c)_, RMP or RMP GP may, prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or
alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity

business days after the date of termination, the RMP Termination Fee.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 7.3(f)_, any payment of the RMP Termination Fee shall
be made in cash by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated in

that RMP pays the RMP Termination Fee to EQM, no RMP Entity shall have any
further liability to any EQM Entity of any kind in respect of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall RMP be
required to pay the RMP Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financing sources, experts and consultants) incurred by RMP and its Affiliates
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up
to a maximum amount of $5,000,000 (the " ** _RMP Expenses_** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall EQM have any obligation to make any such
payment if, at the time of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by
EQM pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ [ _RMP Uncured Breach_ ] and (ii) in
the event of termination of this Agreement by EQM pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_ [ _RMP Uncured Breach_ ], then RMP shall promptly, but in no
event later than three business days after receipt of an invoice (with
supporting documentation) therefor from EQM, pay EQMs designee all of the
reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses
of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, financing sources, experts and
consultants) incurred by EQM and its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of
$5,000,000 (the " ** _EQM Expenses_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall RMP have any obligation to make any such payment if, at the time
of such termination, this Agreement was terminable by RMP pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_ [ _EQM Uncured Breach_ ].

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that RMP is required to pay the RMP Termination Fee or the EQM Expenses, RMP
shall pay to EQM an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the sum of the RMP
Termination Fee and the EQM Expenses (such sum, the " ** _RMP Base Amount_**
") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to EQM without
causing EQM to fail the gross income requirement in Section

 



      
 

 



 

7704(c)(2) of the Code, treating the RMP Termination Fee and the EQM Expenses
as non-qualifying income and after taking into consideration all other sources
of non-qualifying income (computed by treating as non-qualifying income any
income that is not of the type that Baker Botts L.L.P. has opined or will
opine is qualifying income as defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code) (such
maximum amount, the " ** _EQM Non-Qualifying Income Cushion_** "), as
determined by EQMs independent accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event EQM receives an opinion from outside counsel or a ruling from the
IRS (" ** _Tax Guidance_** ") providing that EQMs receipt of the RMP Base
Amount would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code, RMP shall, upon receiving notice that EQM has received the
Tax Guidance, pay to EQM any unpaid portion of the RMP Base Amount within five
(5) business days. In the event that EQM is not able to receive the full RMP
Base Amount due to the above limitations, RMP shall place the unpaid portion
in escrow by wire transfer within three (3) days of termination and shall not
release any portion thereof to EQM unless and until EQM receives either: (x) a
letter from independent nationally recognized accounting firm indicating the
EQM Non-Qualifying Income Cushion for any subsequent year (in which case RMP
shall pay to EQM the lesser of the unpaid portion of the RMP Base Amount or
the EQM Non-Qualifying Income Cushion specified within five (5) business days
after RMP has been notified thereof) or (y) Tax Guidance providing that EQMs
receipt of such portion would either constitute qualifying income (as defined
in Section 7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes
of Section 7704 of the Code (in which case RMP shall pay to EQM any unpaid
portion of the RMP Base Amount within five (5) business days after RMP has
been notified thereof). The obligation of RMP to pay any unpaid portion of the
RMP Base Amount shall terminate on December 31 following the date that is five
(5) years from the date of this Agreement. Any amounts remaining in escrow
after the obligation of RMP to pay the RMP Base Amount terminates shall be
retained by RMP.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that EQM is required to pay the RMP Expenses, EQM shall pay to RMP an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the RMP Expenses and (ii) the maximum amount, if
any, that can be paid to RMP without causing RMP to fail the gross income
requirement in Section 7704(c)(2) of the Code, treating the RMP Expenses as
non-qualifying income and after taking into consideration all other sources of
non-qualifying income (computed by treating as non-qualifying income any
income that is not of the type that Baker Botts L.L.P. has opined or will
opine is qualifying income as defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code) (such
maximum amount, the " ** _RMP Non-Qualifying Income Cushion_** "), as
determined by RMPs independent accountants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event RMP receives Tax Guidance providing that RMPs receipt of the RMP
Expenses would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code, EQM shall, upon receiving notice that RMP has received the
Tax Guidance, pay to RMP any unpaid portion of the RMP Expenses within five
(5) business days. In the event that RMP is not able to receive the full RMP
Expenses due to the above limitations, EQM shall place the unpaid portion in
escrow by wire transfer within three (3) days of termination and shall not
release any portion thereof to RMP unless and until RMP receives either: (x) a
letter from independent nationally recognized accounting firm indicating the
RMP Non-Qualifying Income Cushion for any subsequent year (in which case EQM
shall pay to RMP the lesser of the unpaid portion of the RMP Expenses or the
RMP Non-Qualifying Income Cushion specified within five (5) business days
after EQM has

 



      
 

 



 

been notified thereof) or (y) Tax Guidance providing that RMPs receipt of
such portion would either constitute qualifying income (as defined in Section
7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for purposes of Section
7704 of the Code (in which case EQM shall pay to RMP any unpaid portion of the
RMP Expenses within five (5) business days after EQM has been notified
thereof). The obligation of EQM to pay any unpaid portion of the RMP Expenses
shall terminate on December 31 following the date that is five (5) years from
the date of this Agreement. Any amounts remaining in escrow after the
obligation of EQM to pay the RMP Expenses terminates shall be retained by EQM.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 8.1 _No Survival_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
representations, warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of any other party hereto, whether prior to or after the
execution of this Agreement. The representations, warranties and agreements in
this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 7.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in
_Article II_ and _Section 5.8_ and _Section 5.11_ and any other agreement
in this Agreement that contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall
survive the Effective Time and those set forth in _Section 5.11_, _Section
7.2_ and _Section 7.3_, in the last sentence of _Section 5.6(a)_ and this
_Article VIII_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the RMP Unitholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties, by action taken or authorized by the RMP GP Board
and the EQM GP Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the RMP GP Board and EQM
GP Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has first been
approved in writing by the RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM Conflicts
Committee, as applicable; _provided_ , _further_ , that following approval of
this Agreement and the Merger by the RMP Unitholders, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or stock
exchange rule would require further approval by the RMP Unitholders without
such approval. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement,
whenever a determination, decision, approval or consent of RMP or the RMP GP
Board or of EQM or the EQM GP Board is required pursuant to this Agreement,
such determination, decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the
RMP GP Board and EQM GP Board, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the RMP GP Board and EQM GP Board, as applicable, may not take or authorize
any such action unless such action has first been approved in writing by the
RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM Conflicts Committee, as applicable. In the
event the RMP GP Board or the EQM GP Board, as applicable, takes or authorizes
any action under this _Section 8.2_ that is counter to any action or
recommendation by the RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM Conflicts Committee,
as applicable, or was not approved in writing by such conflicts committee as
required by this _Section 8.2_, then the RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, may rescind its approval of this
Agreement, with such rescission resulting in the rescission of "Special
Approval" under Section 7.9 of the RMP Partnership

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or the EQM Partnership Agreement, as applicable. For the avoidance
of doubt, any rescission of "Special Approval" under the RMP Partnership
Agreement pursuant to the prior sentence shall not, in and of itself,
constitute an RMP Adverse Recommendation Change under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of any other party
hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements
contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such
partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the RMP GP Board or the EQM GP Board may not take or
authorize any action under this Section 8.3 or otherwise grant any consent
under this Agreement unless it has first been approved in writing by the RMP
Conflicts Committee or EQM Conflicts Committee, as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by any RMP Entity or any EQM Entity in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. In the
event the RMP GP Board or the EQM GP Board, as applicable, takes or authorizes
any action under this Section 8.3 that is counter to any action or
recommendation by the RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM Conflicts Committee,
as applicable, or was not approved in writing by such conflicts committee as
required by this _Section 8.3_, then the RMP Conflicts Committee or the EQM
Conflicts Committee, as applicable, may rescind its approval of this
Agreement, with such rescission resulting in the rescission of "Special
Approval" under Section 7.9 of the RMP Partnership Agreement or the EQM
Partnership Agreement, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any
rescission of "Special Approval" under the RMP Partnership Agreement pursuant
to the prior sentence shall not, in and of itself, constitute an RMP Adverse
Recommendation Change under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that (a) EQM may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of EQM, but no such assignment shall
relieve EQM of any of its obligations hereunder and (b) RMP may assign, in its
sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of RMP, but no such assignment
shall relieve RMP of any of its obligations hereunder; _provided_ that in the
case of clause (a) or (b) above, any such assignment shall not materially
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this _Section 8.4_ shall be null and void.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and

 



      
 

 



 

the same agreement) and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.
Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by
electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the RMP Disclosure Schedule, the EQM Disclosure Schedule and any certificates
delivered by any party pursuant to this Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or
otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of clause (b), (i)
the provisions of _Section 5.8_ and _Section 8.12_ and (ii) the right of the
RMP Unitholders to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim
by the RMP Unitholders with respect to which may not be made unless and until
the Closing shall have occurred) and the right of holders of RMP equity awards
to receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
this Agreement after the Closing (a claim by such holders with respect to
which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have occurred).

 



 

Section 8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be
brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any
state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.7_,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit,

 



      
 

 



 

action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto expressly
acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the
Law of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America; provided,
however, that each such partys consent to jurisdiction and service contained
in this _Section 8.7(b)_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this
_Section 8.7(b)_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to such
courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

Section 8.8 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 8.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (a) either
party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity (it being understood
that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the parties hereto from raising
other defenses to a claim for specific performance or other equitable relief
under this Agreement). Each party further agrees that no party shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 8.8_, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. The parties agree that in the event that EQM receives the RMP
Termination Fee, EQM may not seek any award of specific performance under this
_Section 8.8_.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered
personally, by facsimile or email (which is confirmed), or sent by overnight
courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following

hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.
