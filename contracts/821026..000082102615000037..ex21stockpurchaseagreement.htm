STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of May 16, 2015,
by and among The Andersons, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Buyer"), and each
shareholder (each a "Seller" and collectively "Sellers") of Kay Flo
Industries, Inc., an Iowa corporation (the "Company"). This Agreement is
joined in by Raun D. Lohry in his capacity as Sellers' Representative (as
defined in Section 4.11(a)) and, solely for purposes of Sections 4.10(b) and
9.13, by the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary (as defined herein). Buyer
and Sellers (or any Seller) are sometimes individually referred to in this
Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." Each capitalized
term used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined has the meaning set
forth in Article 8.

The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling (a) liquid fertilizer (the "Business") and (b)
animal and protein feed ingredients and products (the "Excluded Business").
After giving effect to the Separation Transactions described in Section
4.1(c), Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to
Buyer, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are collectively owned,
beneficially and of record, by Sellers.

ACCORDINGLY, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

Article 1



Principal Transaction

Section 1.1 Sale and Purchase of Stock. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, Sellers agree to sell and transfer to Buyer, and
Buyer agrees to purchase from Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company, that will, after giving effect to the
redemptions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date as part of the
Separation Transactions, consist of 56,406 shares of Class A Common Stock,
$1.00 par value, and 486,168 shares of Class B Common Stock, $1.00 par value
(collectively, the "Shares") at Closing.



Section 1.2 Closing Cash Payment; Payments; Purchase Price. 

(a)Subject to adjustment under Section 1.3, in consideration of the transfer
of the Shares to Buyer, and the other undertakings of Sellers' set forth in
this Agreement, at Closing Buyer will pay to Sellers an aggregate amount equal
to: (i) $119,800,000; plus or minus (as applicable) (ii) the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital Adjustment; plus (iii) Estimated Closing Date Cash;
minus (iv) the aggregate Closing Date Debt; minus (v) Estimated Closing Date
Pre-Closing Taxes; plus (vi) Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds;
minus (vii) the aggregate Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses; minus
(viii) $1,815,000 (the "Escrow Funds") minus (ix) $2,500,000 (the "Sellers'
Representative Expense Funds"); minus (x) $1,600,000 (the "Headquarters
Purchase Price"); minus (xi) the Seller Premium Amount, minus (xii) the
Estimated Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount, if any (the net amount of
clauses (i) - (xii), the "Closing Cash Payment").

(b)At Closing, Buyer will (i) pay the Closing Cash Payment to Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Sellers'
Representative (as payee agent for each of the Sellers) prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) discharge or cause to be discharged the Closing Date Debt pursuant
to pay-off letters and payment instructions delivered by Sellers prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) pay or cause to be paid any Closing Date Seller
Transaction Expenses included in the calculation of Closing Cash Payment
pursuant to the payment instructions delivered by Sellers' Representative
prior to the Closing Date, (iv) deposit the Escrow Funds with the Escrow Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Escrow Agent, which such Escrow Funds will be held and disbursed by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached to
Exhibit 1.2(b) (the "Escrow Agreement"), (v) pay the Headquarters Purchase
Price to LFE, LLC by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated by LFE, LLC prior to the Closing Date and (vi) deposit the
Sellers' Representative Expense Funds with the Sellers' Representative by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Sellers'
Representative prior to the Closing Date.

(c)As further consideration for the Shares, Buyer will pay Sellers (if earned)
up to an additional $24,000,000 pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit 1.2(c)
(the "Earn-out").

(d)The Closing Cash Payment together with the Escrow Funds and Sellers'
Representative Expense Funds will constitute the "Estimated Purchase Price"
and, as adjusted under Section 1.2(c), Section 1.3, Section 4.3(e) or Article
7, the "Purchase Price."



Section 1.3 Adjustments to Estimated Purchase Price.



(a)Sellers' Representative will, prior to Closing, deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to Buyer Sellers' good faith written calculation of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated
Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
and, if applicable, the Estimated Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount. At
the Closing, the Closing Cash Payment will be (i) determined by reference to
the amount of Sellers' good faith calculation of Estimated Closing Date Cash,
Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing
Tax Refunds and, if applicable, the Estimated Delayed Closing Date Adjustment
Amount and (ii) determined by reference to the amount by which Sellers' good
faith calculation of Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater
than the sum of the Target Amount plus $25,000 (such sum is the "Upper Collar
Amount") or less than the remainder of the Target Amount minus $25,000 (such
remainder is the "Lower Collar Amount"), with no adjustment being made to the
Closing Cash Payment if the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is
between the Upper Collar Amount and Lower Collar Amount. The amount of any
adjustment to the Closing Cash Payment for Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital as provided in Section 1.3(a)(ii) is referred to as the "Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment".

(b)Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared, and
delivered to Sellers' Representative Buyer's good faith written calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing
Taxes, Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds and, if applicable, the 

Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount. Sellers will have the opportunity to
review Buyer's calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
and, if applicable, the Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount for 45 days
(the "Review Period"). Buyer's calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Date Pre-
Closing Tax Refunds and, if applicable, the Delayed Closing Date Adjustment
Amount will become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless, prior
to the end of the Review Period, Sellers' Representative notifies Buyer in
writing of Sellers' objections to such calculation, identifying the disputed
items, the estimated amounts of the disputed items if then reasonably
determinable and the basic facts underlying Sellers' objections. If Sellers'
Representative delivers an objection notice, the Parties will try in good
faith to resolve Sellers' objections within 15 days following delivery of the
objection notice. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative resolve some or all of
such objections within that time period, they will document their resolution
in a writing signed by each of them, and such resolution will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. If Buyer and Sellers' Representative
are unable to resolve all of Sellers' objections within the 15-day time
period, the Parties will promptly refer any matters still in dispute for
resolution as provided in Section 1.3(c).

(c)In the event of any unresolved dispute concerning Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Date Pre-
Closing Tax Refunds and, if applicable, the Delayed Closing Date Adjustment
Amount under Section 1.3(b), then Buyer and Sellers will each designate a
nationally or regionally recognized independent accounting firm with whom
neither Party has any current professional relationship, and the accounting
firm to resolve the dispute will be chosen by lot (such accounting firm is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Accounting Firm"). The fees and expenses
of the Accounting Firm will be paid by the non-prevailing Party as determined
by the Accounting Firm (it being agreed that the non-prevailing Party is the
Party whose calculation of the disputed components of Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Date Pre-
Closing Tax Refunds and/or the Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount (as
applicable) was the furthest, in absolute dollars, from the resolution of the
disputed items as determined by the Accounting Firm). The Accounting Firm will
act as a neutral arbitrator and will exercise its discretion independently to
resolve only the disputed items using the accounting principles used to
determine the Target Amount, but within the range of the differences between
Buyer and Sellers. The Parties will provide the Accounting Firm with all Books
and Records in their possession reasonably relevant to the determinations to
be made by it. No Party nor any Affiliate or Representative of a Party will
meet or discuss any substantive matters with the Accounting Firm without Buyer
and Sellers' Representative and their respective Representatives present or
having the opportunity following at least three Business Days' notice to be
present, either in person or by telephone. The Accounting Firm will have the
power to require a Party to provide to it such Books and Records and other
information it deems reasonably relevant to the resolution of the dispute, and
to require a Party to answer questions that it deems reasonably relevant to
the resolution of the dispute. All Books and Records and other information
(including answers to questions from the Accounting Firm) submitted to the
Accounting Firm must be concurrently delivered to each Party. All disputes
with respect to the application of accounting principles or to the
mathematical calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds or,
if applicable, the Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount will be resolved
exclusively by the Accounting Firm. The determination of the Accounting Firm
with respect to disputes to be resolved by it hereunder, absent manifest
error, will be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes,
Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds and, if applicable, the Delayed Closing
Date Adjustment Amount, as finally determined in accordance with this Section
1.3, are referred to as the "Final Closing Date Net Working Capital," "Final
Closing Date Cash," "Final Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes," "Final Closing
Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds," and the "Final Delayed Closing Date Adjustment
Amount," respectively. 

(d)Following Closing, the Purchase Price (exclusive of the Earn-out) will be
determined by adding to, or subtracting from, the Estimated Purchase Price (as
applicable) on a dollar-for-dollar basis an amount equal to the net result of:
(i) either (A) if the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital was between
the Upper Collar Amount and Lower Collar Amount, then by the amount by which
the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than or less than (as
applicable) the Upper Collar Amount or Lower Collar Amount (as applicable),
with no adjustment being made to the Estimated Purchase Price if the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital is between the Upper Collar Amount and Lower
Collar Amount or (B) if the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital was
greater than the Upper Collar Amount or less than the Lower Collar Amount,
then by the amount by which the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is
greater than or less than (as applicable) the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital; provided, however, that if the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital is between the Upper Collar Amount and Lower Collar Amount, then the
amount to be added to, or subtracted from, the Estimated Purchase Price (as
applicable) will be equal to the inverse of the amount of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment (for example, if the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment was a negative $100, the inverse
would be a positive $100), plus or minus (ii) the amount by which the Final
Closing Date Cash is greater than or less than (as applicable) the Estimated
Closing Date Cash, plus or minus (iii) the amount by which the Final Closing
Date Pre-Closing Taxes is greater than or less than (as applicable) the
Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, plus or minus (iv) the amount by
which the Final Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds is greater than or less
than (as applicable) the Estimated Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds, plus
or minus (v) the amount by which the Final Delayed Closing Adjustment Amount
is greater than or less than (as applicable) the Estimated Delayed Closing
Date Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Purchase Price is increased by the
adjustment provided for in this Section 1.3(d), Buyer will pay such increase
to Sellers within five Business Days following the determination of the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Date Cash, the Final
Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes, the Final Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds
and, if applicable, the Final Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Sellers'
Representative. If the Estimated Purchase Price is decreased by the adjustment
provided for in this Section 1.3(d), Sellers will pay such decrease to Buyer
within five Business Days following the determination of the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Final Closing Date Cash, Final Closing Date Pre-
Closing Taxes, Final Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax Refunds and, if applicable,
the Final Delayed Closing Date Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer.



Section 1.4 Purchase Price Payment Allocation. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Sellers' Representative shall be solely responsible for allocating the
Purchase Price paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement among the Sellers,
which allocation shall be made in accordance with the percentages set forth on
Exhibit 1.4 as calculated and determined based upon each Seller's relative
ownership of the Shares as set forth on Exhibit 2.1(c).



Section 1.5 Closing. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Closing") will take place remotely via exchange of signature pages
on May 18, 2015 or, if later, on the fifth Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 5 (other than
conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing, which
conditions must be satisfied at Closing, unless waived), or at any other
place, time or date as may be mutually agreed by Buyer and Sellers. The date
on which Closing occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." For Tax purposes
and purposes of calculating Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, Final
Closing Date Cash, Final Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes and Final Closing Date
Pre-Closing Tax Refunds, Closing will be deemed effective as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date.



Section 1.6 Closing Deliverables.



(a)At Closing, Buyer will deliver: (i) the Escrow Agreement executed by Buyer,
(ii) a transition services agreement substantially in the form attached to
Exhibit 1.6(a)(ii) (the "TSA") executed by Buyer, (iii) an evaporation

the Separation Transactions have been consummated; (vi) if applicable,

Article 2



Representations And Warranties Of Sellers

Subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, Sellers make the following representations and warranties to Buyer.
These representations and warranties will survive Closing for the periods
specified in Section 9.1.

Section 2.1 Organization; Capitalization; Ownership.



(a)The Company and each Acquired Subsidiary is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state of its incorporation. Copies of the Organizational Documents of the
Company and each Acquired Subsidiary have been provided to Buyer. The Company
and each Acquired Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority
to conduct its business as it is now being conducted, to own and use the
properties and assets that it purports to own and use and to perform its
obligations under Applicable Contracts. The Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in each state or other jurisdiction in which either the
ownership or use of the properties owned or used by it or the nature of the
activities conducted by it requires such qualification, except where the
failure to obtain such qualification would not result in a material liability
to the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b)The authorized capital stock of the Company (i) as of the date hereof,
consists of 2,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of
which 56,406 shares are issued and outstanding and 2,000,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of which 507,654 are issued and outstanding and
(ii) as of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Separation
Transactions, consist of 2,000,000 shares 

of Class A Common Stock, $1.00 par value, of which 56,406 shares will be
issued and outstanding and 2,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, $1.00 par
value, of which 486,168 will be issued and outstanding. Except for the Shares,
there are no other issued or outstanding equity securities of the Company or
any other outstanding securities, options, warrants, or other instruments
convertible or exercisable into any equity securities of the Company. No
Person has any claim for or against any Shares, or for any payments made with
respect to any sale of any Shares. The Shares were validly issued, are fully
paid and nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights of any Person. Except for suspended rights and obligations
under the Shareholder Agreement, there is no Contract that requires any
Seller, the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary to sell, offer to sell, issue
or purchase any equity securities of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary or
other instruments convertible or exercisable into any equity securities of the
Company or any Acquired Subsidiary.

(c)Each Seller owns, beneficially and of record, his, her or its Shares free
and clear of all Encumbrances (other than (i) any Encumbrances arising under
the Shareholder Agreement and the Organizational Documents of the Company, all
of which will be terminated as of Closing, and (ii) transfer restrictions
arising under applicable Laws), and collectively Sellers own, beneficially and
of record, all outstanding Shares. Each Seller owns the number of Shares set
forth next to his, her or its name on Exhibit 2.1(c). No Seller owns his, her
or its Shares jointly with any other Person, and no Person has any right to
consent to or vote upon the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document other than Sellers. Except for the Shareholders
Agreement, there is no Contract that requires any Seller to sell, purchase or
vote in any manner any of the Shares owned by him, her or it. At Closing,
Sellers will collectively transfer to Buyer valid title to all of the Shares
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than transfer restrictions arising
under applicable Laws).

(d)Schedule 2.1(d) sets forth the authorized, issued and outstanding capital
stock of each Acquired Subsidiary. The capital stock of each Acquired
Subsidiary was validly issued, is fully paid and nonassessable and was not
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any Person. There
is no Contract that requires any Seller, the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary to sell, offer to sell, issue or purchase any equity securities of

Subsidiary) will be liable.

Article 4



Covenants And Agreements



The Parties covenant and agree as follows:

Section 4.1 Conduct Pending Closing.



(a)From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, except as expressly
provided herein, Sellers will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary to (i) conduct the operations and
affairs of the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business and not to create,
perform or suffer to exist any Restricted Event, (ii) exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization, personnel,
customer and supplier relationships and goodwill of the Business, except, in
either case, for actions: (A) taken with Buyer's prior written consent, (B) to
prepare for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (C) required to be taken by applicable Law, (D) disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule, or (E) to divest of the Excluded Assets or to otherwise
consummate the Separation Transactions.

(b)From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Sellers will not, and
will cause the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) enter into or continue any substantive negotiations,
discussions or Contracts contemplating or relating to the acquisition by any
Person other than Buyer of all or any part of the Shares then outstanding or
the securities, equity interests, or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or any Acquired Subsidiary (regardless of the form of the
transaction), but excluding sales of inventory or miscellaneous assets in the
Ordinary Course of Business; or (ii) except with the prior written consent of
Buyer, take an action that would constitute a Restricted Event.

As of or prior to the Closing, (i) Sellers shall cause the Company and the
Acquired Companies to distribute, assign, convey, deliver or otherwise
transfer, to Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries) all right, title and interest in, to or under all
Excluded Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Encumbrances in
place on the date hereof or hereafter created without any action by Buyer. All
such transfers shall be made without any representations, warranties or other
obligations or duties on the part of any of the Company or the Acquired
Subsidiaries (other than those set forth herein, in the TSA or any other
Transaction Document) and (ii) Sellers shall (or shall cause a their
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries) to) assume,
pay, perform, discharge and be responsible for the Excluded Liabilities. For
the avoidance of doubt, Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities will not be
taken into account for the purposes of the calculation of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment, the Estimated Closing Date Cash,
the Closing Date Debt, the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital or the Final
Closing Date Cash. The transfers contemplated and described in this Section
4.1(c) together with the Other Separation Transactions and the transactions
contemplated by the TSA shall hereinafter be referred to, collectively, as the
"Separation Transactions". Eric J. Lohry agrees to cause the Excluded Business
to discontinue to use the trademarks NUTRA-FLO and KAY FLO for the Excluded
Business in the case of any jurisdiction other than China, no later than 12
months after the Closing Date, and in the case of China within a period of 24
months after the Closing Date. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers indirectly own
an interest in a joint venture in China which is part of the Excluded Assets
which, pursuant to a sublicense, has limited rights to use NUTRA-FLO marks in
its feed business in China. Eric J. Lohry agrees to cause the Excluded
Business to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the referenced joint 

venture to discontinue its use of the marks licensed to it under the
sublicense in the time period provided above.



Section 4.2 Access to Information. Subject to restrictions contained in any
confidentiality agreement to which Sellers, the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary is subject, from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date,
upon reasonable notice, Sellers will cause the Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary to provide Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access to its
Books and Records in a manner so as to not interfere with its normal business
operations. Sellers will disclose to Buyer and its Representatives a
description of any Books and Records it is withholding due to the
confidentiality obligation described above. All information furnished to or
obtained by Buyer will be treated as confidential information pursuant to the
terms of the confidentiality letter agreement executed by Buyer on May 21,
2014, the provisions of which are incorporated herein by reference.



Section 4.3 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notice; Further Assurances;
Certain Payments.



(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)Buyer and Sellers will each give prompt notice to the other of the
occurrence of any event or the failure of any event to occur that would
reasonably be expected to preclude or interfere with the satisfaction of any
condition precedent to the obligations of a Party under this Agreement or the
timely consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. Prior to Closing, Sellers will have the right
(but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matter that arises, occurs or it becomes aware of after the
date hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Such Supplemental Schedule will be
deemed to have been provided solely for informational purposes and will not in
any way affect the conditions set forth in Article 5 or the determination of
whether there is a breach of any representation or warranty as in effect prior
to such Schedule Supplement for purposes of Article 7; provided, if any
Supplemental Schedule discloses a matter that would result in the failure of
the condition set forth in Section 5.1(a) to be satisfied, and Buyer waives
such failure and proceeds to consummate the Closing, then such matter will be
deemed to have qualified the applicable representations and warranties to
which the disclosure set forth in such Supplemental Schedule relates for
purposes of Article 7\.

(c)After Closing, Buyer and Sellers will take all reasonable actions to
mitigate any Adverse Consequences that are subject to indemnification under
Article 7, and will take all actions, execute and deliver all further
documents and do all other acts and things as the other may reasonably request
to carry out and document the intent of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.



(d)[RESERVED]



(e)Buyer hereby agrees to pay or to cause the Company to pay to Sellers any
insurance proceeds received by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company
and the Acquired Subsidiaries) after Closing in respect of the fire that
occurred at the Sergeant Bluff Facility in excess of the amount, if any, of
the Sergeant Bluff Closing Date Removal and Replacement Reserve. In addition,
if the aggregate amount of Acid Purchase Rebate Payments received by the
Company, any Acquired Subsidiary, Buyer or any other Affiliate of Buyer after
Closing exceeds the Buyer Retained Acid Purchase Rebate Amount, then Buyer
shall pay Sellers an amount equal to the amount of such excess by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated by Sellers'
Representative within five Business Days after the date on which the related
Acid Rebate Payment is received by the Company, any Acquired Subsidiary, Buyer
or any other Affiliate of Buyer. 

The amount of any payment made to Sellers pursuant to this Section 4.3(e)
shall be considered additional Purchase Price.



Section 4.4 Restrictive Covenants. In consideration of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and other valuable consideration:



(a)For a period of five years from the Closing Date, each Seller will not, and
will cause such Seller's Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (i) compete
with the Company or an Acquired Subsidiary in the Business as it is currently
conducted or (ii) participate in the ownership, management, financing or
control of, or act as an employee, advisor, consultant or agent to, or furnish
services to, any Person that competes with the Company or an Acquired
Subsidiary in the Business as it is currently conducted. The geographic scope
of the foregoing covenant is the United States.

(b)For a period of three years from the Closing Date, each Seller will refrain
from and will cause such Seller's Affiliates to refrain from soliciting any
existing customer of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary to divert or
adversely change such existing customer's business relationship with the
Company or any such Acquired Subsidiary relating to the Business; provided,
however, that no action taken by a Seller or any of its Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of the TSA shall be construed as a breach of this
Section 4.4(b).

(c)For a period of two years from the Closing Date:

i.each Seller will not and will cause such Seller's Affiliates not to (A) hire
or induce or assist any other Person to hire any employee of the Company or
any Acquired Subsidiary or (B) induce or assist any other Person to induce any
employee to leave his or her employment with the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.4(c)(i) will
apply to (1) any action taken by a Seller or any of its Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of the TSA or any individual who responds to or is
hired as a result of (x) general mass solicitations of employment and
generalized employee searches by headhunter/search firms (in either case not
specifically directed at employees of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary)
or (y) solicitations initiated by any employee of the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary or (2) the hiring or solicitation of any employee listed on
Schedule 4.4(c)(i) (but subject to any time limitations or waiting periods
applicable to any such employee as set forth on Schedule 4.4(c)(i)).

ii.Buyer will not and will cause its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries) not to (A) hire or induce or assist any other Person to
hire any employee of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates or (B)
induce or assist any other Person to induce any employee to leave his or her
employment with any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 4.4(c)(ii) will apply to any action
taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in accordance with the terms of the
TSA or any individual who responds to or is hired as a result of (1) general
mass solicitations of employment and generalized employee searches by
headhunter/search firms (in either case not specifically directed at employees
of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates) or (2) solicitations
initiated by any employee of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.

(d)From the Closing Date and forever afterward, each Seller will not use or
disclose to any Person any non-public information of or relating to the
Business, the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary, except in connection with
any Proceeding subject to Article 7 or if required to do so by applicable Law
or legal process (provided that such Seller makes a reasonable effort to
notify Buyer before complying with the applicable Law or legal process to
enable Buyer to seek an appropriate protective order), and except to the
extent that such information enters the public domain through no fault of such
Seller in violation of this Agreement.

(e)If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the time period of any of
the foregoing covenants is too lengthy or the geographic coverage or scope of
any of the covenants is too broad, the restrictive time 

period will be deemed to be the longest period permissible under applicable
Law and the geographic coverage and scope will be deemed to comprise the
largest coverage and scope permissible under applicable Law. It is the
Parties' intent to protect and preserve the Business and goodwill of the
Company and each Acquired Subsidiary to be acquired by Buyer, and each Seller
agrees that the time period, the geographic coverage and scope of the
covenants set forth in this Section 4.4 are reasonable. If a Seller breaches
or threatens to breach any of the foregoing covenants, Buyer will be entitled
to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies that may be
available under applicable Law.

(f)Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will prevent or
restrict a Seller from: (i) owning as a passive investment less than 5% of the
outstanding shares of the capital stock of a corporation or the outstanding
equity interests of any other entity (in each case, whether public or
private); (ii) performing speaking engagements and receiving honoraria in
connection with such engagements; (iii) being employed by any government
agency, college, university or non-profit research organization; (iv) any
activity consented to in writing by Buyer; or (v) owning, managing, financing
or otherwise being involved in the Excluded Business.



Section 4.5 Public Announcements. Each Party will, and will cause its
Affiliates and Representatives (including in the case of Buyer following
Closing, the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary) to, maintain the
confidentiality of the material terms of this Agreement and will not, and will
cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the economic terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that a Party
may, without the prior consent of the other Party, issue or cause publication
of any such press release or public announcement to the extent that such Party
reasonably determines, after consultation with legal counsel, such action to
be required by applicable Law or by the rules of any applicable self-
regulatory organization, in which event such Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
press release or public announcement in advance of its issuance.



Section 4.6 Employee Benefit Matters.



(a)From and after the Closing Date, Buyer may, and may cause the Company and
each Acquired Subsidiary to, maintain all employees on the Company's current
Employee Benefit Plans until such time as Buyer, in its sole discretion,
elects to integrate such employees to Buyer's employee benefit plans (the "New
Plans"). From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the
Company and each Acquired Subsidiary to, grant all employees credit for any
service with the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary earned prior to the
Closing Date: (a) for eligibility and vesting purposes; and (b) for purposes
of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations under any benefit or
compensation plan, program or Contract that may be established or maintained
by Buyer, the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary on or after the Closing Date
(the "New Plans"). Employees will not be eligible for Buyer's closed retiree
health program, the Buyer's closed pension plan, or the Buyer's defined
contribution plan. Buyer will: (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) cause
any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any employee
(or covered dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions after the Closing Date under any New Plan. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee of the
Company or any Acquired Subsidiary any right to continued employment for any
period. 

(b)Sellers shall bear the cost (either through a reduction in cash resulting
from a pre-Closing payment or the accrual of a liability that is taken into
account in calculating the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital) of any
severance owed to any Company employee not listed on Exhibit 4.6 whose
employment (with the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary) terminates prior to
the Closing Date. Buyer and Sellers shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of the
severance cost of any employee listed on Exhibit 4.6 under the heading
entitled "Designated Employees" (each a "Designated Employee") whose
employment (with the Company, any Acquired Subsidiary or any entity
established to operate the Excluded Business) terminates prior to, on or after
the Closing Date. Buyer shall bear the cost of any severance owed to any
employee of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary that is not a Designated
Employee whose employment terminates on or after the Closing Date; provided,
however, to the extent that any employees listed on Schedule 2.6(f) that are
not Designated Employees are terminated by the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary during the 120-day period following the Closing Date, then Sellers
will pay Buyer an amount equal to: (i) fifty percent (50%) of the first
$50,000 of the aggregate severance costs paid to such terminated employees and
(ii) twenty-five percent (25%) of the next $50,000 of the aggregate severance
cost paid to such terminated employees. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event will the aggregate amount required to be paid to Buyer by Sellers
pursuant to (i) and (ii) above exceed $37,500. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything else contained herein to the contrary, Sellers shall have no
obligations under this Section 4.6(b) to pay all or any portion of, or to
reimburse Buyer for all or any portion of, any severance costs paid or payable
to any employee listed on Exhibit 4.6 under the heading entitled "DPS
Employees" (each a "DPS Employee") whose employment with the Company or any
Acquired Subsidiary is terminated. Buyer and Sellers agree that any Designated
Employee that is terminated prior to, on or after the Closing Date and any
employee of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary that is not a Designated
Employee and that is terminated after the Closing Date shall, in each case,
receive 2 weeks' severance pay for every year of service (with a maximum
amount of six months of severance pay) upon such employee's termination.

(c)The Parties hereby agree that no provision of this Section 4.6 is intended
to, and that no such provision does, confer upon any Person other than the
Parties any right to or remedies hereunder, including the right to enforce any
obligations of any Party contained herein. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, will be construed to prevent a Party or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries) from: (i) terminating,
or modifying the terms of employment of, any employees of the Company or any
Acquired Subsidiary; or (ii) terminated or modifying to any extent any
Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan, or Assigned Welfare Benefits or any other
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that any Party or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Acquired Subsidiaries) may
establish or maintain. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as an
amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan or Assigned Welfare Benefit
or any other compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to
directors, officers, employees or independent contractors of Buyer, the
Company or any Acquired Subsidiary prior to or following the Closing Date.



Section 4.7 Assignment of Rights; Reimbursement. To the extent a Seller or
Sellers indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Adverse
Consequences under Article 7, each Buyer Indemnified Party will, as a
condition to indemnification, assign to the applicable Seller or Sellers to
the fullest extent allowable its rights and causes of action against other
Persons with respect to the matter giving rise to indemnification, or in the
event assignment is not permissible, allow the applicable Seller or Sellers to
pursue such claim, at his or its expense, in the name of any Buyer Indemnified
Party. The applicable Seller or Sellers will be entitled to retain all
recoveries for its own account made as a result of any such action. Buyer will
cause each Buyer Indemnified Party and its respective Affiliates to provide
reasonable assistance to the applicable Seller or Sellers in prosecuting any
such claim, including making its Books and Records relating to such claim
available to the applicable Seller or Sellers and their Representatives and
making its employees available for interview, testimony and similar
assistance. If any Buyer Indemnified Party recovers from another Person any
part of a claim that has previously been paid a Seller or Sellers pursuant to
Article 7, 

Buyer will cause such Buyer Indemnified Party to promptly remit such amounts
to the applicable Seller or Sellers, without regard to the time limitations
described in Section 9.1.



Section 4.8 Records Retention. Buyer will preserve in accordance with its
normal documentation program, the pre-Closing Books and Records of the Company
and each Acquired Subsidiary. After the Closing Date, Buyer will provide
Sellers and their Representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to pre-Closing Books and Records of the Company and each
Acquired Subsidiary, and Sellers and their Representatives will have the right
to make copies of such pre-Closing Books and Records at their expense.



Section 4.9 Certain Tax Matters.



(a)Straddle Period Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Taxes
attributable to the income, property or operations of the Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins on or before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") will be
apportioned between the portion of the Straddle Period that begins before the
Closing Date and ends on and includes the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Straddle Period") and the portion of the Straddle Period that begins the day
after the Closing Date and ends at the end of the Straddle Period (the "Post-
Closing Straddle Period") in accordance with this Section 4.9(a). The portion
of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Straddle Period will: (i) in the case
of any income, sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes,
withholding taxes and any other Tax based on or measured by income, business
activity, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to
equal the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and
included the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of personal property, real
property, ad valorem and other Taxes of the Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary imposed on a periodic basis during a Straddle Period, be deemed to
be the amount of the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. The portion of Taxes attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle
Period will be calculated in a corresponding manner.

(b)Tax Returns

i.Except as provided in Section 4.9(f) with respect to Transfer Taxes, Sellers
will prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, all Tax
Returns of the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period (the "Pre-Closing Period Returns") having a due date (taking
into account valid extensions) on or before the Closing Date. The Pre-Closing
Period Returns prepared and filed by the Sellers will be prepared and filed in
a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company and any
Acquired Subsidiary, as applicable, (including prior Tax elections and
accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company or any such
Acquired Subsidiary), except as required by Law. Buyer will prepare or cause
to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns of the
Company and each Acquired Subsidiary, including the Straddle Period Returns.
Buyer will prepare and file the Straddle Period Returns and the Pre-Closing
Period Returns that it is required to file pursuant to this Section 4.9(b)(i)
in a manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company and any
Acquired Subsidiary, as applicable, (including prior Tax elections and
accounting methods or conventions made or utilized by the Company or any such
Acquired Subsidiary), except as required by Law. Buyer will deliver all
Straddle Period Returns and Pre-Closing Period Returns that it is required to
file pursuant to this Section 4.9(b)(i) to Sellers for review and comment at
least 30 days prior to the due date (including valid extensions) for filing
such Tax Returns (except where such 30-day period is not practical, in which
case as soon as practical). Within 15 days of receiving a draft of such Tax
Return (except where such 15-day period is not practical, in which case as
soon as practical), Sellers may provide written 

comments to Buyer. The Parties will attempt to resolve any dispute through
direct good-faith negotiation subject to the dispute resolution procedures of
Section 4.9(g). In no event will the provision of comments by Sellers prevent
Buyer from timely filing any such Tax Return; provided, however, that in the
event that the Accounting Firm has not yet resolved any such Tax Dispute prior
to the deadline for filing such Tax Return (including any extensions), Buyer
will be entitled to file such Tax Return (or amendment) as prepared by Buyer
subject to amendment to reflect the resolution when rendered by the Accounting
Firm. Unamortized debt financing costs, change of control bonus payments
(including those included in the definition of Seller Transaction Expenses)
and any other amounts payable by or on behalf of the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law to be deducted for income Tax
purposes on Straddle Period Returns or Pre-Closing Period Returns and to the
extent paid or accrued by the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary and included
in the calculation of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital (or in the
Closing Date Seller Transaction Expenses), will be reported on such returns as
income Tax deductions of the Sellers for the Tax year (or portion thereof)
that ends on or includes the Closing Date and will not be reported on any
income Tax Return of Buyer.

ii.Buyer will not (and will not allow the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary
to): (A) file any Pre-Closing Period Returns required to be prepared and filed
by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.9(b)(i) or (B) amend any Pre-Closing Period
Returns or any Straddle Period Returns required to be prepared and filed by
Buyer pursuant to Section 4.9(b)(ii), or make or amend any material claim,
disclaimer or election in respect of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period, without the prior written consent of Sellers.

(c)Tax Refunds and Reductions of Tax. Following Closing, any Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds that are received or applied by the Company, any Acquired Subsidiary,
Buyer or their respective Affiliates will be for the account of Sellers to the
extent such Pre-Closing Tax Refund was not taken into account (and to the
extent not taken into account) in calculating Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds or any adjustments thereto, and Buyer or its Affiliates (as
applicable) will, or will cause the Company or the applicable Acquired
Subsidiary to, pay over to Sellers any such Pre-Closing Tax Refund within 15
days after receipt or application thereof.

(d)Cooperation. The Parties will and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, provide each other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company or
any Acquired Subsidiary or otherwise relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including signing any Tax Return), any audit or other examination by
any Taxing Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating
to liabilities for Taxes of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary. Such
assistance will include making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information or explanation of material provided
hereunder and will include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns and
supporting material. The Parties and their respective Affiliates will retain
for the full period of any statute of limitations, and upon reasonable request
will provide the other Party with, any records or information which may be
relevant to such preparation, audit, examination, proceeding or determination.

(e)Audits. If any Taxing Authority issues to the Company, any Acquired
Subsidiary, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates a written notice of
its intent to audit, examine or conduct a Proceeding, a written notice of its
determination of an objection to an assessment with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Period or
a Straddle Period, or a written notice or inquiry with respect to any Taxes or
the filing of a Tax Return in each case, for which Sellers may be liable
pursuant to Article 7 (a "Tax Claim"), Buyer will notify Sellers of such Tax
Claim within two Business Days following receipt; provided, however, that the
failure of Buyer to notify Sellers of its receipt of a Tax Claim within two
Business Days will not relieve Sellers from liability pursuant to Article 7
except to the extent Sellers are prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.
Sellers will control any Tax Claim and any other 

matter with respect to a Pre-Closing Period of the Company or any Acquired
Subsidiary (a "Sellers' Tax Contest"), provided that Buyer, at its sole cost
and expense, will have the right to participate in Sellers' Tax Contest and
provided further that Sellers will provide Buyer with a copy of the final
resolution of Sellers' Tax Contest. Buyer will control any Tax Claim that is
not a Sellers' Tax Contest (a "Buyer's Tax Contest"), provided that Sellers,
at Sellers' sole cost and expense, will have the right to participate in any
Buyer's Tax Contest that relates to a Straddle Period. The Party controlling a
Tax Claim described in the preceding two sentences will not agree to settle
such Tax Claim if such settlement could affect the Tax liability of the other
Party without the prior written consent of such other Party, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided that if
any Party (the "First Party") reasonably withholds consent for a settlement,
the other Party (the "Second Party") will be entitled to enter into such
settlement without the consent of the First Party so long as the Second Party
agrees to indemnify the First Party for any adverse Tax consequences suffered
by the First Party as a result of such settlement.

(f)Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, stamp,
registration, filing, recordation, valued-added, and other similar Taxes and
fees that may be imposed or assessed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, together with any interest, additions or
penalties with respect thereto, and any interest in respect of such additions
or penalties, imposed or assessed as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"), will be paid promptly by Buyer when due.
Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes will be
prepared by the Party primarily or customarily responsible under applicable
Law for filing such Tax Returns, and such Party will use its reasonable best
efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other Party at least 10 Business
Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. Buyer and Sellers
will cooperate in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns.
Any Transfer Taxes resulting from any subsequent increase in Purchase Price
will be borne by Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this Section
4.9(f). Any payments made under this Section 4.9(f) will be accounted for as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(g)Procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Section 4.9
(a "Tax Dispute") that the Parties using reasonable best efforts are not able
to resolve through direct good-faith negotiation, will be resolved in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.9(g). If there has
been no resolution of the Tax Dispute after direct negotiation, then any Party
may seek resolution of the Tax Dispute through binding arbitration
administered by tax experts of the Accounting Firm. The place of the
arbitration will be Chicago, Illinois. The Accounting Firm will be instructed
to resolve the Tax Dispute and such resolution will be: (A) set forth in
writing and signed by the Accounting Firm, (B) delivered to each Party as soon
as practicable after the Tax Dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm but
no later than the 15th day after the Accounting Firm is instructed to resolve
the Tax Dispute, (C) made in accordance with this Agreement, and (D) absent
manifest error, final, binding and conclusive on each Party. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid by the non-prevailing Party as
determined by the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm will act as a neutral
arbitrator and will exercise its discretion independently to resolve only the
disputed items, but within the range of the differences between the Parties.
Each Party will provide the Accounting Firm with all Books and Records in its
possession relevant to the determinations to be made by it. Neither Party
will, and each Party will cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to,
meet or discuss any substantive matters with the Accounting Firm without the
other Party and its Representatives present or having the opportunity
following at least three Business Days' notice to be present, either in person
or by telephone. The Accounting Firm will have the power to require a Party to
provide to it such Books and Records and other information it deems relevant
to the resolution of the Tax Dispute, and to require a Party to answer
questions that it deems relevant to the resolution of the Tax Dispute. All
Books and Records and other information (including answers to questions from
the Accounting Firm) submitted to the Accounting Firm must be concurrently
delivered to each Party. All disputes with respect to any Tax Dispute will be
resolved exclusively by the Accounting Firm. 

(h)Conduct Pending Closing Regarding Taxes. Without the prior written consent
of Buyer, between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Sellers will not,
and will cause the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary not to, make or change
any election, change any annual accounting period, adopt or change any
accounting method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing
Contract, settle any Tax Claim relating to the Company or a Acquired
Subsidiary, surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax Claim
relating to the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary or take any other action
relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, Contract, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
of the Company or a Acquired Subsidiary for any period ending after the
Closing Date or decreasing any Tax attribute of the Company or a Acquired
Subsidiary existing on the Closing Date.

(i)No Section 338 Elections. Buyer will make no election under Code Section
338 or any similar Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

any nature or kind, whether known or unknown, matured or contingent and
whether arising in Law, in equity or otherwise, or based upon facts,
circumstances or occurrences existing on or prior to Closing, including rights
and claims arising under any Contracts existing prior to Closing between a
Seller and the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary; provided, however, that the

Section 4.11 Sellers' Representative.



(a)Sellers hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint Raun D. Lohry (the
initial "Sellers' Representative") as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact
with full power of substitution to do on behalf of Sellers any and all things,
including executing any and all documents, which may be necessary, convenient
or appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including: (i)
receiving and disbursing payments to be made hereunder; (ii) receiving notices
and communications pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; (iii) administering this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including the resolution of any disputes or claims; (iv) making
determinations to settle any dispute as to the calculation of the Purchase

conditions and obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents; and (vi) asserting claims for indemnification under Article 7 and
resolving, settling or compromising any such claim.

(b)If Sellers' Representative is of the opinion that he requires further
authorization or advice from Sellers on any matters concerning this Agreement,
Sellers' Representative is entitled to seek such further authorization from
Sellers prior to acting on their behalf. In such event and on any other matter
requiring or permitting Sellers to vote in this Section 4.11, each Seller will
have a number of votes equal to the Shares owned by that Seller immediately
prior to Closing and the authorization of a majority of such Shares will be
binding on all Sellers and will constitute authorization by all Sellers.

(c)Buyer will be fully protected in dealing with Sellers' Representative with
respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and may rely upon the authority
of Sellers' Representative to act as the agent of Sellers for all purposes
under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Any payment by Buyer to Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document will be
considered a payment by Buyer to Sellers. The appointment of Sellers'
Representative is coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable by any
Seller in any manner or for any reason. This power of attorney will not be
affected by the disability or incapacity of the principal pursuant to any
applicable Legal Requirement. Sellers' Representative will have no individual
liability to Buyer under this Agreement arising from his actions as Sellers'
Representative.

(d)If at any time there is more than one Sellers' Representative, any act of
Sellers' Representative will require the act of a majority of Sellers'
Representatives which shall be binding upon all the Sellers and Sellers'
Representatives, and upon such act by a majority of Sellers' Representatives,
Buyer shall, in reliance thereon, be entitled to all benefits and protections
of Section 4.11(c) as though such act were the unanimous act of all the
Sellers' Representatives. Any Sellers' Representative may resign from his
capacity as a Sellers' Representative at any time by written notice delivered
to the other Sellers and to Buyer. If at any time there is no person acting as
a Sellers' Representative for any reason, Sellers will promptly designate a
new Sellers' Representative and notify Buyer in writing of such determination.
Following the time that Buyer is notified that there is no Sellers'
Representative and until such time as a new Sellers' Representative is
designated as provided herein and Buyer is so notified in writing, Sellers
will collectively act as Sellers' Representative, with decisions made in the
manner specified in Section 4.11(b).

(e)Raun D. Lohry, as the initial Sellers' Representative, acknowledges that he
has carefully read and understands this Section 4.11, hereby accepts such
appointment and designation, and represents that he will act in his capacity
as Sellers' Representative in compliance with and conformance to the
provisions of this Section 4.11.

(f)Sellers' Representative will not be liable to Sellers for any error of
judgment or any act done or action taken or omitted by him in good faith or
for any mistake in fact or Law, or for anything that he may do or refrain from
doing in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,
except for his own bad faith or willful misconduct. Sellers' Representative
may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question
as to the construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or his duties hereunder or thereunder, and he will incur
no liability to Sellers and will be fully protected with respect to any action
taken, omitted or suffered by him in good faith in accordance with the opinion
of such counsel.

(g)Any expenses incurred by Sellers' Representative in connection with the
performance of his duties under this Agreement (including any fees and
expenses of legal counsel retained by Sellers' Representative) will not be the
personal obligations of Sellers' Representative but will be payable and will
be promptly paid or reimbursed first from the Sellers' Representative Expense
Funds and thereafter by Sellers pro rata in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Shares.



Section 4.12 Termination of Shareholder Agreement. Sellers hereby agree that
the Shareholder Agreement, and all rights and obligations thereunder, will be
terminated without further action effective immediately prior to Closing.



Section 4.13 Real Property and Environmental Buyout Transaction Matters.



(a)Prior to Closing, Buyer shall obtain commitments to issue owner's title
insurance policies in the amounts of the fair market values of, and insuring
good and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property and the
Headquarters, which policies (i) shall not contain standard survey exceptions
(ii) shall not be subject to any Encumbrance (other than Permitted
Encumbrances) and (iii) will include zoning endorsements. Sellers shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses related to the obtaining of such
owner's title insurance policies and zoning endorsements, and Buyer shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses related to surveys that are required in
order to obtain such title commitments; provided, however, that if any costs
and expenses related to surveys are paid by Sellers (or the Company or any
Acquired Subsidiary), then Buyer shall promptly reimburse Sellers for the
amount of such costs and expenses paid by Sellers (or the Company or any
Acquired Subsidiary).

(b)Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to complete the Phase I environmental studies and investigations
of the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property in the most
expeditious manner practicable. In addition, (i) if Buyer reasonably
determines, based on adverse developments identified in the results of the
Phase I environmental studies and investigations, that Phase II environmental
studies and investigations of any of the Owned Real Properties or the Leased
Real Properties are necessary or (ii) if Phase II environmental studies and
investigations of any of the Owned Real Properties or the Leased Real
Properties are required by third Persons in order to obtain insurance coverage
for the environmental representations and warranties contained in Article 2 or
to in order to obtain the coverage contemplated in connection with any
environmental buyout transaction, then Buyer will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be take all actions and to do or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to complete any such
Phase II environmental audits in the most expeditious manner practicable. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers will (and will cause the Company and the
Acquired Subsidiaries to) cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with
Buyer and its representatives in connection with the Phase I, any Phase II
environmental studies and investigations described above, including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions
reasonably requested by Buyer or its representatives that are necessary in
order to allow such Phase I and, if applicable, any Phase II environmental
studies and investigations to be completed in an expeditious manner.

given before or at Closing:

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement.



Section 7.3 Certain Limitations.

(a)Deductible; Claim Threshold. Sellers will have no liability under Section

forth in Article 2 until the aggregate amount of all Adverse Consequences
incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties caused by breaches of
the representations and warranties set forth in Article 2 taken as a whole
exceed $600,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only for the amount of Adverse
Consequences in excess of the Deductible, provided, however, that the
Deductible will not apply to (i) claims for breaches of representations and
warranties in Sections 

2.1(b)-(c) (Capitalization; Ownership), 2.4 (Taxes), 2.11(a) (Authorization
and Enforceability), 2.15 (Broker's Fees), (ii) for actual fraud by Sellers in

(b)Cap. Sellers' aggregate maximum liability under Section 7.1(a)(i) with
respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Article

warranties in Sections 2.1(b)-(c) (Capitalization; Ownership), 2.11(a)
(Authorization and Enforceability) and 2.15 (Broker's Fees) and (ii) the Cap

of lists or items of a material nature or above a specified threshold, in the
case of each of (i) and (ii), as to which this Section 7.3(c) will not apply.

(d)Additional Limitations.

i.No Person will be entitled to be indemnified with respect to any claim or
Adverse Consequence to the extent that the matter that is the subject of the
claim or such Adverse Consequence was taken into account in determining or
calculating Final Closing Date Net Working Capital or was raised and resolved
by agreement of the Parties or through the dispute resolution procedures
described in Section 1.3 in connection with determining Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital. No Person will be entitled to be indemnified for an amount
pertaining to Adverse Consequences to the extent such amount was included in
the calculation of Closing Date Debt, Closing Date Seller Transaction
Expenses, Closing Date Pre-Closing Taxes or Closing Date Pre-Closing Tax
Refunds for purposes of the calculation of the Closing Cash Payment nor shall
such amounts be included in determining whether the Cap has been met. No Party
will be obligated to indemnify a Person with respect to any claim that relates
to any Adverse Consequence resulting from the passing of or change in any Law
or any accounting policy, principle or practice after the Closing Date or any
increase in Tax rates in effect on the Closing Date, even if the change or
increase has retroactive effect or requires action at a future date. The Buyer
Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification for any Adverse
Consequences resulting from a Buyer Indemnified Party taking a position with
respect to a Tax Return of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary that was
required to be filed on or before Closing that is inconsistent with a position
taken on or with respect to such Tax Return, including the position that no
Tax Return was required to be filed, unless the position taken on or with
respect to such Tax Return did not comply with applicable Law at the time such
Tax Return was required to be filed.

ii.The Buyer Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to indemnification under
this Article 7 for Adverse Consequences to the extent caused or aggravated by
acts or omissions of any Buyer Indemnified Party following the Closing Date
that are grossly negligent, willfully intended to cause liability hereunder,
or in violation of this Agreement or applicable Law.

iii.No Party will be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party (as applicable) with respect to a breach of a
representation or warranty if the facts, circumstances or events constituting
the breach were known by any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller 

Indemnified Party, as the case may be, prior to the date of this Agreement,
provided that the disclosure thereof would have enabled such Party not to
disclose pursuant to the provisions of Article 5.

iv.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, Sellers will not be required to indemnify a Buyer
Indemnified Party for any Adverse Consequences relating to any environmental
matters, including any Adverse Consequences relating to matters disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule, any Environmental Liabilities and any Adverse
Consequences arising from any Environmental Conditions; Buyer has assumed all
risks associated with environmental matters in consideration of a negotiated
reduction in the Purchase Price.



Section 7.4 Indemnification Procedures.



(a)Third-Party Proceedings.

i.Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to be indemnified under this
Article 7 (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of a
Proceeding against him, her or it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim for
indemnification is to be made against a Party (an "Indemnifying Party") under
this Article 7, give prompt notice to the Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such Proceeding. Such notice will identify the matter for
which indemnification is sought, state the estimated amounts of the claim if
then reasonably determinable and state the basic facts underlying the claim to
the extent then known. The failure to timely notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that the Indemnifying
Party may have to an Indemnified Party except to the extent that the defense
of such Proceeding was prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
provide timely notice.

ii.The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in any Proceeding
with respect to which indemnification has been or will be sought hereunder
and, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party wishes, to assume the defense
of such Proceeding. Following an assumption of defense by an Indemnifying
Party hereunder (A) the Indemnifying Party will have no liability for any
subsequent fees of legal counsel or other expenses incurred by the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Proceeding and (B) if a Seller or the Sellers
are the Indemnifying Party, any costs, expenses and Adverse Consequences
incurred in connection with such Proceeding will be satisfied solely from the
Escrow Funds in the applicable Escrow Account and not directly from such
Seller or Sellers, as applicable, and the Parties will execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent any written instructions necessary to disburse the Escrow
Funds to satisfy the same. If an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Proceeding, no compromise or settlement of the underlying claims may be
effected by it without the Indemnified Party's consent (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full or otherwise provided for
by the Indemnifying Party concurrently with the compromise or settlement. If
an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, the Indemnified
Party will not settle such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party will have
the right to settle any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party first waives any right to
indemnity under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or any related
matter. Without impairing an Indemnified Party's right to seek
indemnification, if an Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense
of a Proceeding, the terms of any settlement of such Proceeding by the
Indemnified Party (including with respect to the amount of any Adverse
Consequences or any purported admissions or facts or other matters stipulated
to in connection with such settlement) will not be binding on an Indemnifying
Party for purposes of such Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party consents to such settlement in writing
or if indemnification is imposed upon such 

Indemnifying Party pursuant to a final order entered in a Proceeding before a
court of competent jurisdiction.

iii.The assumption of the defense of any Proceeding by an Indemnifying Party
will not constitute an admission of responsibility to indemnify or in any
manner impair or restrict that Indemnifying Party's rights to later seek to be
reimbursed for its costs and expenses if indemnification with respect to such
Proceeding was not required. An Indemnifying Party may elect to assume the
defense of a Proceeding at any time during its pendency, even if initially the
Indemnifying Party did not elect to assume such defense, so long as the
assumption of such defense at such later time would not materially and
irreparably prejudice the rights of the Indemnified Party. If an Indemnifying
Party elects to assume the defense of a Proceeding but subsequently determines
in good faith that indemnification with respect to such Proceeding is not
required under this Article 7, such Indemnifying Party may elect to transfer
the defense back to the Indemnified Party in a manner that would not
materially and irreparably prejudice the rights of the Indemnified Party.

iv.Except to the extent it would cause a waiver of a privilege, each Party
will make available to the other Party and the other Party's Representatives
all of its Books and Records and, as applicable, employees relating to a
third-party Proceeding, and each Party will render to the other assistance as
may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper and adequate defense
of such third-party Proceeding.

(b)Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party Proceeding must be asserted by written notice to Buyer, if
indemnification is sought against Buyer, or to the applicable Seller or
Sellers (or the Sellers' Representative), if indemnification is sought against
a Seller or Sellers, as applicable, identifying the matter for which
indemnification is sought, the estimated amounts of the claim if then
reasonably determinable and the basic facts underlying the claim to the extent
then known.



Section 7.5 Source of Payment. Any Adverse Consequences recoverable by a Buyer
Indemnified Party under this Article 7 will first be recovered from the Escrow
Funds and then from the applicable Seller or Sellers, in each case pursuant to
the terms and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement
(including the Deductible and the Cap); provided, however, this Section 7.5
shall not apply with respect to Adverse Consequences that constitute Specified
Environmental Losses, which shall be recoverable by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties solely to the extent permitted pursuant to the terms and conditions
of, and solely and exclusively in the manner and from the sources contemplated
under, Section 7.3(e).



Section 7.6 Adjusted Purchase Price. Any payment of a claim for
indemnification under this Article 7 will be accounted for as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price to the extent permitted by applicable Law.



Section 7.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except for a Party's right to seek specific
performance or other equitable relief, this Article 7 constitutes the sole and
exclusive remedy of each Party, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives with respect to any matters arising under or with respect to
this Agreement or relating to or arising from the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, and each Party hereby irrevocably waives from and after
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action that it may have or may in the future have
against the other relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Article 9



General



Section 9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by a Party in
this Agreement will survive Closing, except for any representations and
warranties made by Sellers in Article 2 relating to environmental matters
which will terminate at Closing. The representations and warranties set forth
in Articles 2 and 3 will expire on the date that is 18 months following the
Closing Date, except that: (a) the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.4 (Taxes) and 3.4 (Solvency) and claims based on actual fraud in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement will expire on
the date that is 90 days following the expiration of the applicable statutes
of limitations, (b) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
2.1(b)-(c) (Capitalization; Ownership), 2.11(a) (Authorization and
Enforceability), 3.2(a) (Authorization and Enforceability) will expire on the
date that is five years following the Closing Date. An indemnification claim
under Article 7 for breach of a representation or warranty set forth in
Articles 2 or 3 must be asserted in writing by a Party within 30 days after
the expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty as provided in the preceding sentence and the Parties waive any right
under any statute of limitations to bring any claim for breach of such
representation or warranty after such survival period.



Section 9.2 Binding Effect; Benefits; Assignment. The terms of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents executed by a Party will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and against such Party and his,
her or its heirs, legal representatives (including any personal
representative), successors and authorized assigns. Except: (a) as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or another Transaction Document and (b)
for the provisions of Article 7 which are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, nothing in this Agreement or such other Transaction
Document, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or such other
Transaction Document, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents being
for the exclusive benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, legal
representatives (including any personal representative), successors and
assigns. No Party may assign any of his, her or its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to any other Person
without the prior written consent of the other Parties to this Agreement or
other Transaction Documents, as applicable, and any such attempted or
purported assignment will be null and void; provided, however, that Buyer may,
without consent, assign all or part of its rights under this Agreement or
other Transaction Document to one or more of its Affiliates, which assignment
will not relieve Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document.



Section 9.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules to
this Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule) and the other Transaction
Documents set forth the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other
Transaction Documents, as applicable, and supersede all prior Contracts,
letters of intent, arrangements and understandings relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. No representation, promise, inducement or statement
of intention has been made by any Party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or other Transaction Document that is not
embodied in this Agreement or such other Transaction Document, as applicable,
and no Party will be bound by or liable for any alleged representation,
promise, inducement or statement of intention not so embodied. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers specifically make no
representation or warranty with respect to any projections, estimates 

or budgets delivered or made available to Buyer or its Representatives at any
time with respect to future revenues, expenses or expenditures or future
results of operations.



Section 9.4 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled, and any of its provisions may be waived, only by a
written instrument executed by the Parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the
Party waiving compliance. The failure of a Party at any time to require
performance of any provision of this Agreement will in no manner affect the
right of that Party at a later time to enforce such provision. No waiver by a
Party of any provision of this Agreement or the breach of any provision of
this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be or
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such provision or breach, or
any other provision of this Agreement.



Section 9.5 Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction. This Agreement and any
dispute about which this Agreement is a subject will be governed by and
construed in accordance with the applicable Law of the State of Iowa as
applicable to Contracts made and to be performed in the State of Iowa, without
regard to conflicts of laws principles. The Parties hereby submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Woodbury
County, Iowa in respect of any Proceeding related to or arising out of a
Transaction Document, including any Proceeding involving the interpretation or
enforcement of the provisions of a Transaction Document, and the Parties
hereby waive, and agree not to assert, any defense in any such action, suit or
Proceeding, that they are not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
the applicable Transaction Document may not be enforced in or by such courts
or that their property is exempt or immune from execution, that such suit,
action or Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of
such suit, action or Proceeding is improper. The Parties agree not to bring
any Proceeding relating to or arising out of this Agreement in any court other
than the state or federal courts located in Woodbury County, Iowa.



Section 9.6 Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
required or permitted to be given pursuant to this Agreement must be in

A Party may change its address, telephone number or facsimile number by prior
written notice to the other Party provided as set forth in this Section 9.6.

Section 9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by original signature
or by facsimile, digital or other electronic signature and in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and together will
constitute one and the same instrument.



Section 9.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, Sellers, on one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will each pay
all of his, her or its own expenses, costs and fees (including legal and other
professional fees and costs) incurred by each of them (and, in the case of
Sellers, the expenses incurred by Sellers' Representative) in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (whether the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated or not).



Section 9.9 Headings; Construction; Time of Essence. The headings of the
articles, sections and paragraphs in this Agreement have been inserted for
convenience of reference only and will not restrict or otherwise modify any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the
words "including," "include" or "includes," or other similar words, whenever
used in this Agreement will be deemed to be immediately followed by the words
"without limitation." With regard to all dates and time periods set forth or
referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. References in this
Agreement to any gender include references to all genders, and references to
the singular include references to the plural and vice versa. Neither this
Agreement nor any other Transaction Document (nor any uncertainty or ambiguity
herein or therein) will be construed against a Party under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party will be considered the draftsman of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document. This Agreement and each other
Transaction Document has been reviewed, negotiated and accepted by each Party
and its Representatives and will be construed and interpreted according to the
ordinary meaning of the words so as fairly to accomplish the purposes and
intentions of the Parties. The provisions of this Agreement have been
negotiated by and chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction will be applied against a Party. All references to
dollars in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document are to U.S.
Dollars.



Section 9.10 Partial Invalidity. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement and each other Transaction Document will be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any one
or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement or other Transaction
Document is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect, such invalidity, illegality or 

unenforceability will not affect any other provision of this Agreement or
other Transaction Document, as applicable, and this Agreement or other
Transaction Document will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein or
therein unless the deletion of such provision or provisions would result in
such a material change as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to be unreasonable. If the deemed deletion of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions is reasonably likely to have
a material adverse effect on a Party, the Parties will endeavor in good faith
to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid
provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as practicable to that
of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.



Section 9.11 Certain Disclosure Matters. The Disclosure Schedule contains a
series of schedules which, in part, set forth information specifically
referred to in Article 2 and, in part, provide exceptions or qualifications to
the representations and warranties contained in Article 2 (the latter
schedules are not specifically referred to in Article 2). Neither the
specification of any dollar amount in Article 2 nor the disclosure of a
document or information in a schedule comprising part of the Disclosure
Schedule is intended, or will be construed or offered in any dispute between
the Parties as evidence of, the materiality of such dollar amount, document or
information, nor does it establish any standard of materiality upon which to
judge the inclusion or omission of any similar documents or information in
that schedule or any other schedule comprising the Disclosure Schedule. The
information contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule is
disclosed solely for the purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission of any matter
whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any Contract. An
exception or qualification set forth in the Disclosure Schedule with respect
to a particular representation or warranty will be deemed to be an exception
or qualification with respect to all other applicable representations and
warranties to the extent the description of the facts regarding the event,
item or matter disclosed is adequate so as to make reasonably clear or
otherwise make Buyer reasonably aware that such exception or qualification is
applicable to such other representations and warranties whether or not such
exception or qualification is so numbered or such other representations and
warranties expressly refer to a schedule comprising the Disclosure Schedule.



Section 9.12 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
could occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed by a Party
in accordance with the terms hereof and that in addition to any other remedy
to which a Party is entitled at Law or in equity, the non-breaching Party will
be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and will be entitled to specifically enforce the performance of the provisions
hereof. The Parties agree and acknowledge that (a) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 9.12, a Party will not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party
under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for
in this Section 9.12 are not available or otherwise are not granted and (b)
nothing contained in this Section 9.12 will require any Party to institute any
Proceeding for (or limit any Party's right to institute any Proceeding for)
specific performance under this Section 9.12 before properly exercising any
termination right under Article 6 (and pursuing any other remedies under this
Agreement after such termination) nor will the commencement of any Proceeding
pursuant to this Section 9.12 or anything contained in this Section 9.12
restrict or limit any Party's right to properly terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of Article 6 or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each Party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Party has an adequate remedy at
Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. 



Section 9.13 Representation by Legal Counsel; Privileged Communications. In
the event of any dispute following the Closing between Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary), on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, Buyer, the Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary hereby consent to the representation by Barnes and Thornburg LLP
and/or Crary, Huff, Ringgenberg, Hartnett and Storm, P.C. of Sellers (or
Sellers' Representative, as the case may be) notwithstanding the prior
representation of the Company or any Acquired Subsidiary by Barnes and Thornburg
LLP or and Crary, Huff, Ringgenberg, Hartnett and Storm, P.C., and Buyer, the
Company and each Acquired Subsidiary hereby waive any right to object thereto
on the basis of any conflict of interest arising from such representation or
similar claim. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all communications between
or among Sellers, Sellers' Representative, the Company and/or each Acquired
Subsidiary and their respective employees and agents, on one hand, and their
respective legal counsel (including Barnes and Thornburg LLP and Crary, Huff,
Ringgenberg, Hartnett and Storm, P.C.), on the other hand, relating to the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby are privileged
communications for the sole benefit of Sellers (or Sellers' Representative, as
the case may be), and Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including, following Closing, the Company and each Acquired Subsidiary),
hereby waives and releases any rights or with respect to such privileged
communications. Effective upon Closing, the Company and each Acquired
Subsidiary hereby transfers and assigns to Sellers any interest or right they
would otherwise be deemed to have in such privileged communications.
