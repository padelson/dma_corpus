(iv) increased by an amount of interest on $1,486,154,275 for the period from
the date on which all of the conditions set forth in Article 10 have been

amount) and (ii) such documents customary in similar transactions as might be
reasonably requested by Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 



(b) Seller shall repay, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to

under the ISDA Master Agreements); (v) releases of all Liens covering any of
the Interests; and (vi) such additional documents customary in similar
transactions as might be reasonably requested by Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



Section 2.03. _Closing Net Debt; Purchase Price Adjustment._ (a) If Estimated
Closing Net Debt exceeds Closing Net Debt, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner provided in Section 2.03(b),
the amount of such excess. If Closing Net Debt exceeds Estimated Closing Net
Debt, then Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price,
in the manner provided in Section 2.03(b), the amount of such excess. The
parties agree that, for purposes of this Section 2.03, Closing Net Debt shall
be determined assuming that (i) the Debt Repayment Amount is equal to the
amount actually paid at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02(b) and (ii)
Closing Cash is equal to the amount of cash and cash equivalents of the
Company and the Subsidiaries actually used to pay a portion of the Debt
Repayment Amount at the Closing pursuant to Section 2.02(b).



(b) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.03(a) shall be made within five Business
Days after the Closing (x) in the case of payments made by Buyer, by delivery
to Seller of immediately available funds to an account previously designated
by Seller or (y) in the case of payments made by Seller, by delivery to Buyer
of immediately available funds to an account previously designated by Buyer. 



Section 2.04 _. Title Defects; Purchase Price Adjustment. _ (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in no event
later than the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller written notices
identifying each matter that it believes in good faith to be a Title
Defect, together with a good faith estimate of the associated Title Defect
Amount for each such alleged Title Defect, and reasonable written
documentation to support Buyers claims of each such Title Defect and Title
Defect Amount (the "Title Defect Notice"). In order for Seller to review the
alleged Title Defects listed in the Title Defect Notice, Buyer will provide to
Seller and its representatives copies of any documents used to determine the
existence of each Title Defect and the amount of the estimated Title Defect
Amount associated with such Title Defect. Buyer shall include in the  



 

9  Title Defect Notice only Title Defects with Title Defect Amounts that are
reasonably believed, in good faith, to individually exceed $40,000.



(b) If Seller disagrees with the existence of a Title Defect or
the associated Title Defect Amount, then Seller shall notify Buyer of such
disagreement in writing (a "Notice of Disagreement") within 60 days after its
receipt of the applicable Title Defect Notice. Such Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail Sellers grounds for such disagreement and
the Title Defect Amount estimated by Seller therefor, as applicable. To the
extent Seller does not contest a Title Defect or a Title Defect Amount in a
Notice of Disagreement within 60 days of its receipt of the applicable Title
Defect Notice, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the existence of such
Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder.



(c) If a Notice of Disagreement is timely provided by Seller, Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days after
delivery of such Notice of Disagreement (or such longer period as they may
mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect to the existence of
any Title Defect or the amount of any Title Defect Amount contested in the
Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to
resolve such disagreements, then, upon the written request of either party,
Seller and Buyer agree that within a further 15 day period, they will jointly
select an arbitrator who is an attorney experienced in the natural gas and gas
exploration and production industry in the United States as well as in real
estate and title insurance matters, or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by
Seller and Buyer (the "Title Defect Arbitrator"), to resolve any remaining
disagreements. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree upon the designation of
a Person as a Title Defect Arbitrator, they shall request the American
Arbitration Association to appoint the Title Defect Arbitrator and such Title
Defect Arbitrator shall hear all matters submitted under this Section 2.04(c).



(d) The Title Defect Arbitrator shall determine as promptly as
practicable (but in any event within 60 days) following the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Title Defect Arbitrator the existence of any
alleged Title Defect or the amount of any disputed Title Defect Amount, as the
case may require, identified in the Notice of Disagreement and not previously
resolved by the parties. Each party shall set forth in writing its position
regarding the existence of each alleged Title Defect and the amount of each
Title Defect Amount referred to the Title Defect Arbitrator for resolution,
and the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be required to select the position of
either one party or the other with respect to each such Title Defect or Title
Defect Amount, as the case may require. Each party shall bear its own
expenses and the fees and expenses of its own representatives and experts in
connection with the preparation, review,  



 

10  dispute (if any) and final determination of any alleged Title Defects.
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall share equally the
costs, expenses and fees of the Title Defect Arbitrator. The determination of
the Title Defect Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties and shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.



(e) As used in this Agreement, an "Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amount" shall
mean any of (i) a Title Defect Amount that is not contested under any Notice
of Disagreement within the time period set forth in Section 2.04(b), (ii) a
Title Defect Amount that is mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, or
(iii) a Title Defect Amount resulting from a determination of the Title Defect
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.04(d).



(f) As set forth in Section 2.01(b), the Purchase Price payable at the Closing
shall be decreased by the amount, if any, by which the aggregate amount of
all Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amounts as of Closing exceeds $10,000,000 (
_provided_ that such decrease shall not exceed $50,000,000). After Closing,
Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer any Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amounts
finalized after Closing to the extent that such amounts, together with all
other Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amounts, exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate (
_provided_ that the aggregate amount of such payments, together with the
amount of any decrease in the Purchase Price payable at the Closing pursuant
to Section 2.01(b) in respect of any Agreed-Upon Title Defect Amounts, shall
not exceed $50,000,000). Buyer understands and agrees that the adjustment to
the Purchase Price and the payments provided for in this Section 2.04
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any Title Defect, and
no claim may be made by Buyer or its Affiliates in respect of any such Title
Defect pursuant to any representation or warranty made by Seller or any of
its affiliates or representatives.



Section 2.05. _Allocation of Purchase Price._ (a) As soon as practicable
after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation
Statement"), allocating the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.01(b)) , plus the liabilities of the Company and the Disregarded
Subsidiaries to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of
the Code, among the assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code. If within 10 days after the delivery of the
Allocation Statement, Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller objects to
the allocation set forth in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute within 20 days.
In the event that Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute within
20 days, Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain independent accountants of
nationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller
(who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or Seller) (the
"Accounting Referee") to resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the
disputed items, the allocation reflected on the Allocation  



 

11  Statement shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The costs, fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. 



(b) Seller and Buyer agree to (i) be bound by the Allocation Statement and
(ii) act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the preparation,
filing and audit of any Tax return (including filing Form 8594 with its
federal income Tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the
Closing).



(c) If an adjustment is made with respect to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.03 or Section 2.04, the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and as mutually agreed by Buyer and
Seller. In the event that an agreement is not reached within 30 days after
the Closing (in the case of Closing Net Debt) or the amount of any Title
Defect (in the case of any Title Defect), any disputed items shall be resolved
in the manner described in Section 2.05(a) (in the case of Closing Net Debt)
or Section 2.04(c) (in the case of any Title Defect). Buyer and Seller agree
to file any additional information return required to be filed pursuant to
Section 1060 of the Code and to treat the Allocation Statement as adjusted in
the manner described in Section 2.03 or Section 2.04, as applicable. Not
later than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating
to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its
Form 8594.

another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing

28 ARTICLE 8

TAX MATTERS



Section 8.01. _Definitions_. The following terms, as used herein, have the
following meanings:



"Pre-Closing Tax Period" means (i) any Tax period commencing on or after
August 29, 2003 and ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) with respect
to any Tax period that began before and ends on or after August 29, 2003, the
portion of such period beginning on August 29, 2003 and ending on or before
the Closing Date, and, (iii) with respect to a Tax period that begins on or
before the Closing Date and ends thereafter, the portion of such Tax period
ending on the Closing Date.



"Post-Closing Tax Period" means any Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date; and, with respect to a Tax period that begins on or before the Closing
Date and ends thereafter, the portion of such Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date.



"Tax" means any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of
any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, withholding on amounts
paid to or by any Person), together with any interest, penalty, addition to
tax or additional amount imposed by any governmental authority (domestic or
foreign) responsible for the imposition of any such tax (a
"Taxing Authority").



Section 8.02. _Tax Representations_. All material Tax returns, statements,
reports and forms (collectively, the "Returns") required to be filed with any
Taxing Authority on or before the date hereof by, or with respect to, the
Company or any Subsidiary have been timely filed on or before the Closing
Date, and, as of the time of filing, all such Returns were true, correct and
complete in all material respects. The Company and the Subsidiaries have
timely paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on the Returns that have been
filed. The charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to the
Company and the Subsidiaries reflected on the books of Company and the
Subsidiaries are adequate, under GAAP, to cover material Tax liabilities
accruing through the end of the last period for which Company and the
Subsidiaries ordinarily record items on their respective books. There are no
Liens on any of the assets of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries that
arose in connection with any failure to pay any Tax. There is no action,
suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now proposed or pending
against or with respect to Company or any Subsidiary in respect of any
material Tax. Except as set forth in Schedule 8.02, each of the Company and
the Subsidiaries is "disregarded as an entity separate from its owner" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section § 301.7701-3.



 

29 Section 8.03. _Tax Covenants_. (a) Buyer covenants that, without the written
consent of Seller, it will not cause or permit the Company, any Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of Buyer (i) to take any action on the Closing Date other than
in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to the
distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, that
could give rise to any Tax liability of Seller, or (ii) to make any election
or deemed election under Section 338 of the Code or any comparable provision
under applicable law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(b) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds of
Taxes and interest thereon received by the Company or any Subsidiary
attributable to Taxes paid by the Company or any Subsidiary (or any
predecessor) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. If, in lieu of
receiving any such refund, the Company or any Subsidiary reduces a Tax
liability with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall promptly pay
or cause to be paid to Seller the amount of such reduction in Tax
liability attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property
transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be borne and paid by Buyer, and Buyer
shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Returns and other documentation.



(d) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Returns required to be
filed by the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall timely file, or cause to be timely
filed, all such Returns. Any such Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice and without a change of any election or any
accounting method and shall be submitted by Buyer to Seller (together with
schedules, statements and, to the extent requested by Seller, supporting
documentation) at least 45 days prior to the due date (including extensions)
of such Return. If Seller, within 10 business days after delivery of any such
Return, notifies Buyer in writing that it objects to any items in such
Return, the disputed items shall be resolved by mutual agreement by Buyer and
Seller. If Buyer and Seller cannot resolve the disputed items within a
reasonable period of time, taking into account the deadline for filing such
Return, the disputed items shall be resolved by an Accounting Referee in the
manner described in Section 2.05. Upon resolution of all such items, the
relevant Return shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be
binding upon the parties without further adjustment. The costs, fees and
expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.



 

30 Section 8.04. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer and Seller agree to furnish
or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Company and the Subsidiaries as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of any Return (including any report required
pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder), for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment.
Buyer and Seller agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and records
pertinent to the Company and the Subsidiaries until the applicable period for
assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any and all extensions or
waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with all record
retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other
proceedings involving the Company or any Subsidiary for any Tax purposes and
each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as
are necessary to carry out the intent of this subsection.



Section 8.05. _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements contained in this Article 8 shall
survive for the full period of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to
any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) and the representations and
warranties contained in this Article 8 shall survive until the Closing.



ARTICLE 9

will cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to provide the Transferred
Employees with compensation, benefits and responsibilities that, in the

(A) With respect to the 401(k) retirement plan in which employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries participate ("Company 401(k) Plan"), immediately
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall fully vest all Transferred
Employees under the Company 401(k) Plan.



(B) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to (i) continue the
Company 401(k) Plan or (ii) cover, or cause its subsidiaries to cover, each
Transferred Employee under one or more other defined contribution plans and
trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively,
"Buyer DC Plans") on the same basis as similarly situated Buyer employees and
on terms that reflect the service credit provisions of Section 9.01(b)(v).



(v) Buyer shall grant each Transferred Employee credit for years of
uninterrupted prior service with the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or
their respective predecessors ( _i.e._ , Columbia Energy Group and its

Triana Energy, Inc.) for all purposes except with respect to the Buyers
existing non-qualified deferred compensation plans, including Buyers 401(k)
Make-Up Plan or for benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan.



(vi) Buyer will, and will cause its subsidiaries to: 



(A) where reasonably possible, waive all limitations as to pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees under any health
and welfare plans in  



 

32  which such Transferred Employees are eligible to participate after the
Closing Date to the extent that the Transferred Employee was an active
participant in such health and welfare plan and that such limitations were
waived under the applicable Employee Plan;



(B) where reasonably possible, provide each Transferred Employee with credit
for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
health and welfare plans that such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date;



(C) to the extent and for the maximum period required by applicable law, take
action as may be necessary so that if any Transferred Employee is terminated
on or after the Closing Date, pursuant to the provisions of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), Sections 601
et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, such Transferred Employee may
continue coverage under the group health and dental insurance plan (including

such termination. From and after the closing date, such terminated employee
will be fully responsible for all of such costs; and



(D) honor any accrued but unused vacation as of the Closing Date.



(c) Any Transferred Employee who (A) accepts an offer of employment
from Buyer at Closing and is subsequently terminated other than for cause
within one (1) year of the Closing Date, or (B) rejects an offer of employment
from Buyer at Closing (which offer of employment did not meet the requirements
of Section 9.01(b)(i) or required that the Transferred Employee relocate
employment to a location greater than fifty (50) miles from his or her present
employment location) and does not otherwise accept another offer of employment
from Buyer at Closing shall be entitled to severance from Buyer in an amount
equal to the product of 2 weeks of base pay _multiplied by_ his or her years
of uninterrupted prior service (as determined in the first sentence of Section
9.01(b)(v) and taking into account any post-Closing service with Buyer or any
of its subsidiaries), with a minimum of 12 weeks of base pay and a maximum of
52 weeks of base pay. Thereafter, remaining Transferred Employees shall be
covered by the severance plan or policy, if any, then in effect for similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its subsidiaries.



 

33 (d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
Section 9.01 shall be construed to limit in any way the ability of Buyer or
its subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee from
and after the Closing Date; _provided_ that such termination is in accordance
with applicable law.

 



(e) This Article 9 is expressly not intended to provide any employee
of Seller a separate cause of action against Buyer or Seller, and the duties
and obligations of Seller and Buyer to each other are intended to be
enforceable only between them, and do not grant any benefits, duties or
obligations to any third party, including but not limited to the employees of
Buyer or the employees of Seller or their respective beneficiaries.

35 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated

this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any representation
or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be fully liable

Section 12.03. _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in
writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this
Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective.



(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.



Section 12.04. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ that any financial advisor or legal
counsel fees incurred by the Company and the Subsidiaries in connection with

Section 12.05. _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of each other party hereto; _provided_ that Buyer may assign all of
its rights and obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer
without the consent of Seller; _provided further_ that any such assignment
shall not release Buyer from any of its obligations hereunder.



Section 12.06. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.



Section 12.07.  _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York State
court sitting in New York City, so  



 

38  long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such
suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of
this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business
in the State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 12.02 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.



Section 12.08. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.



Section 12.09. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.



Section 12.10.  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.



Section 12.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect  



 

39  and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.



Section 12.12. _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company has or may have set forth
information on a Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to
the section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a Schedule need not be set forth in any other Schedule so long as
its relevance to such other section of the Schedule or section of the
Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed
therein to the Person to which such disclosure is being made. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Schedules to this Agreement may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that
the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that
the matter is material.



 

40 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
