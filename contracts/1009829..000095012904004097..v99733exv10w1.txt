funds by 2:00 p.m., New York City time



                                       13
<PAGE>

directly to Sellers, with each Seller receiving that percentage of the Cash
Component as is set forth on Schedule 2.2, which percentage corresponds to the
percentage that the HK Assets or US Assets, as the case may be, represent of the
Assets in their entirety based on the purchase price allocation agreed to by the
parties and set forth on Schedule 6.2(l) hereto.

               2.3 Purchase Price Adjustments.

                      (a) Net Worth Adjustment.

                             (i) Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, Sellers' shall provide to Purchasers and JAKKS at Sellers' expense (A)
Sellers' combined balance sheet, prepared in a manner consistent with the
Financial Statements, as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), (B) a statement of the legal and accounting expenses
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement paid by (or to be
paid by) Sellers' in connection with the Closing or the determination of the Net
Worth Adjustment, (C) a statement of Sellers' combined Net Worth, prepared in a
manner consistent with the Financial Statements, as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the "Closing Net Worth"), (D) based on the foregoing item, a
computation of the difference, if any, between Sellers' Closing Net Worth and
the Target Closing Net Worth, and (E) a computation of the Closing Purchase
Price as determined by Sellers in accordance with this Section 2.3(a) (the "Net
Worth Adjustment").

                             (ii) Purchasers shall provide Sellers, their
respective accountants and other personnel preparing the Closing Balance Sheet
and statement of Sellers' Closing Net Worth with access at Purchasers' principal
offices, at all times upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to
Purchasers' personnel, properties, and books and records pertaining to the
Assets for purposes of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Net Worth
statement. Purchasers and JAKKS shall have the right to audit the preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing Net Worth statement, and shall have
reasonable access to the workpapers of the accountants and other personnel of
Sellers preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and statement of Sellers' Closing
Net Worth. During the thirty (30) days immediately following the receipt by
Purchasers and JAKKS of the items set forth in Section 2.3(a)(ii), Purchasers
and JAKKS and their respective accountants shall be entitled to review such
items and any working papers, trial balance and similar materials relating
thereto prepared by Sellers, their accountants or other personnel.

                             (iii) (A) If Purchasers or JAKKS do not accept the
Closing Balance Sheet or Sellers' computation of the Closing Purchase Price
and/or the Net Worth Adjustment (including any entries, figures or computations
on the Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Net Worth statement and any other figures
or computations used in determining the Closing Purchase Price or the Net Worth
Adjustment), Purchasers shall give written notice to Sellers within thirty (30)
days after delivery thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything contained
herein to the contrary, to the extent that Purchasers or JAKKS require
additional written documentation and information that is reasonably necessary
for them to evaluate Sellers' computation of the Closing Purchase Price and/or
the Net Worth Adjustment, Purchasers' and JAKKS' review period shall be extended
for an additional ten (10) business days from their receipt of such additional
written documentation and information. The notice shall set forth in



                                       14
<PAGE>

reasonable detail the basis for Purchasers' and JAKKS's objections to the
Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Purchase Price and/or the Net Worth Adjustment.

                                    (B) If Purchasers or JAKKS do not object
within such thirty (30) day period, the Closing Balance Sheet, Closing Purchase
Price and the Net Worth Adjustment shall be deemed accepted and approved by
Purchasers and JAKKS. If Purchasers or JAKKS shall raise any objections within
the thirty (30) day period, the parties shall attempt to resolve the matter or
matters in dispute. If the matters in dispute cannot be resolved by the parties
within sixty (60) days after delivery of Purchasers' or JAKKS' objections, the
specific matters in dispute shall be submitted to BDO Seidman, LLP (the
"Arbitrating Accountants"), which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to such matter or matters. The Arbitrating Accountants shall
deliver to the parties their written determination regarding the matters
submitted to them within sixty (60) days, which determination shall be binding
and conclusive upon all parties with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet and
calculation of the Closing Purchase Price and/or the Net Worth Adjustment. Any
such determination shall not require Sellers to alter the Financial Statements.

                                    (C) Fees and expenses of the Arbitrating
Accountants shall be paid 50% by the Purchasers and 50% by Sellers.

                             (iv) If Sellers' Closing Net Worth is less than the
Target Closing Net Worth, then Sellers shall pay Purchasers the excess of the
Target Closing Net Worth over the Closing Net Worth. If Sellers fail to make any
payment required by this clause (iv) within the time frame established by
Section 2.3(c) below, then Sellers also shall pay interest at the Prime Rate on
the amount of such payment for the period from the date such payment was due
through (but excluding) the actual date of such payment to Purchasers.

                       (b) First Review Period Adjustment.

                             (i) If during the 2004 Review Period of the
Earn-out Period, Purchasers do not achieve Adjusted Gross Profit equal to at
least 110% of the Base, then JAKKS, on behalf of Purchasers, shall be entitled
to claim and receive from Sellers and Stockholders (on a joint and several
basis) as an adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price (the "First Review
Period Adjustment" and, together with the Net Worth Adjustment, the "Purchase
Price Adjustments") an amount equal to the amount that corresponds to the
difference expressed as a percentage between Adjusted Gross Profit attained
during the 2004 Review Period and the Base as set forth on the following Table;
provided, that, in no event shall the First Review Period Adjustment paid to
JAKKS exceed $10.0 million.

                             (ii) The procedures set forth in Section 2.4(g)
through (i) below shall control in the event of any disagreement among the
parties over the Post-Closing Statement delivered by Purchasers for the 2004
Review Period and Purchasers' calculation of the First Review Period Adjustment.

                      (c) Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments. Any payment
pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be made by Sellers within five (5) business
days after acceptance of any Purchase Price Adjustment by the parties or, in the
case of written notice of objection by Purchasers or Sellers, as the case may
be, within five (5) business days after any Purchase Price Adjustment is finally
determined as provided above. In the event Sellers fail to make any payments
required under this Section 2.3, Purchasers shall have the right to set-off the
amounts owing against any Post-Closing Payment payable to Sellers hereunder.

               2.4 Earn-out.

                      (a) If, during the 2004 Review Period of the Earn-out
Period, EBITDA equals at least $41.0 million, Purchasers shall pay Sellers an
amount (each a "Post-Closing Payment" and, collectively, the "Post-Closing
Payments") equal to one-half of the dollar amount of EBITDA attained during the
2004 Review Period in excess of $41.0 million; provided, that, in no event shall
any Post-Closing Payment for calendar 2004 exceed $10.0 million. Sellers
acknowledge and agree that if a Post-Closing Payment is made by Purchasers for
the 2004 Review Period, the dollar amounts payable for the remainder of the
Earn-out Period shall be adjusted such that for each subsequent Review Period,
the maximum Post-Closing Payment payable shall equal 1/3rd of the difference
between $30.0 million and the amount of the 2004 Post-Closing Payment, with a
corresponding percentage reduction in the payments payable at each of the lower
thresholds of each remaining Review Period. For example, if in the 2004 Review
Period EBITDA of $65.0 million is achieved and Sellers therefore receive a $10.0
million Post-Closing Payment, the maximum Post-Closing Payment for each
subsequent Review Period would be $6,666,667 and the payments for each of the
lower thresholds would be reduced on a corresponding percentage basis, such that
the lowest Post-Closing Payment payable to Sellers would be $1,333,333. If
instead, however, EBITDA for the 2004 Review Period is only $49.0 million and
Sellers therefore receive a Post-Closing Payment of $4.0 million for the First
Review Period, the maximum Post-Closing Payment for each of the following Review
Periods would be $8,666,667 and the payments for each of the lower thresholds
would be reduced on a



                                       16
<PAGE>

corresponding percentage basis, such that the lowest Post-Closing Payment
payable to Sellers would be $1,733,333.

                      (b) If, during the 2005 Review Period of the Earn-out
Period, Adjusted Gross Profit with respect to the Play Along Products is equal
to at least 112% of the Base, Purchasers shall pay Sellers a Post-Closing
Payment equal to the amount that corresponds to the aggregate percentage
increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from the Base attained during the 2005 Review
Period as set forth on Table A of Schedule 2.4.

                      (c) If, during the 2006 Review Period of the Earn-out
Period, Adjusted Gross Profit with respect to the Play Along Products is equal
to at least 122% of the Base, Purchasers shall pay Sellers a Post-Closing
Payment equal to the amount that corresponds to the aggregate percentage
increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from the Base attained during the 2006 Review
Period as set forth on Table B of Schedule 2.4.

                      (d) If, during the 2007 Review Period of the Earn-out
Period, Adjusted Gross Profit with respect to the Play Along Products is equal
to at least 132% of the Base, Purchasers shall pay Sellers a Post-Closing
Payment equal to the amount that corresponds to the aggregate percentage
increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from the Base attained during the 2007 Review
Period as set forth on Table C of Schedule 2.4.

                      (e) Subject to the completion of the Sellers' Review
Period and any exercise by Purchasers of their set-off rights described in
Section 2.3(c) above, each Post-Closing Payment shall be made within ninety (90)
days after the end of the applicable Review Period triggering Purchasers'
obligations hereunder and shall be payable by wire transfer to Sellers in
accordance with the written instructions of Sellers previously given to
Purchasers pursuant to Section 2.2. For the avoidance of doubt, if it is
reasonably likely that the Sellers' Review Period will extend beyond ninety (90)
days after the end of the applicable Review Period, then Purchasers within such
ninety (90) day period shall pay that portion of a Post-Closing Payment that is
not disputed by Purchasers and Sellers. Subject to Purchasers' set-off rights
described in Section 2.3(c) above, if Purchasers fail to make any Post-Closing
Payment (or undisputed portion thereof) within the time frame established above,
then Purchasers also shall pay interest at the Prime Rate on the amount of such
Post-Closing Payment (or undisputed portion thereof) for the period from the
date such payment was due through (but excluding) the actual date of such
payment to Sellers. In no event shall Purchasers or JAKKS be obligated to make
Post-Closing Payments aggregating in excess of Thirty Million Dollars
($30,000,000) plus any late payment interest that may have accrued as referred
to above, and payment of the foregoing amount by Purchasers pursuant to the
terms hereof shall relieve Purchasers and JAKKS of any further obligations under
this Section 2.4.

                      (f) Within sixty (60) days following the end of each
Review Period during the Earn-out Period, Purchasers shall (i) prepare or cause
to be prepared a statement setting forth the EBITDA or Adjusted Gross Profit, as
the case may be, which shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP, for that
Review Period and the percentage increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from the Base
for that Review Period (each a "Post-Closing Statement") and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to Sellers the Post-Closing Statement.

                      (g) During the ten (10) business days immediately
following the receipt by Sellers of a Post-Closing Statement (the "Sellers'
Review Period"), Sellers and their respective accountants and attorneys shall be
entitled to review such items and any working papers, trial balance and similar
materials relating thereto prepared by Purchasers, their accountants or other
personnel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Sellers require
additional written documentation and information that is reasonably necessary
for Sellers to evaluate a Post-Closing Statement, the Sellers' Review Period
shall be extended for an additional ten (10) business days from Sellers' receipt
of such additional written documentation and information. If Sellers in good
faith disagree with any Post-Closing Statement, Sellers may deliver to
Purchasers, within the Sellers' Review Period, a notice (the "Earn-out Objection
Notice") setting forth in reasonable detail (i) the amounts with which Sellers
disagree and the basis for such disagreement and (ii) Sellers' proposed
corrections to the Post-Closing Statement. Sellers shall be deemed to have
agreed with all amounts contained in the Post-Closing Statement to which no
specific objection has been made. If Sellers do not deliver an Earn-out
Objection Notice prior to the expiration of Sellers' Review Period, Sellers
shall be deemed to agree in all respects with Purchasers' calculation of the
Adjusted Gross Profit and the percentage increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from
the Base for that Review Period, and those respective amounts and percentages as
set forth in the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon Sellers
and Purchasers.

                      (h) If an Earn-out Objection Notice is properly and timely
delivered, Sellers and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith with each other
to resolve the disputed amounts set forth in the Earn-out Objection Notice. If
the parties are unable to resolve the disputed amounts set forth in the Earn-out
Objection Notice within five (5) calendar days after Sellers' delivery of the
Earn-out Objection Notice to Purchasers, the parties shall cause the Arbitrating
Accountants to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed amounts in the
Post-Closing Statement for the purpose of calculating the Adjusted Gross Profit
and the percentage increase in Adjusted Gross Profit from the Base for that
Review Period. In making any such calculations, the Arbitrating Accountants
shall consider only those amounts in the Post-Closing Statement as to which the
Stockholders' Representative has, in the Earn-out Objection Notice, disagreed.

                      (i) The Arbitrating Accountants shall deliver to Sellers
and Purchasers, as promptly as practicable, but no later than five (5) calendar
days after the Arbitrating Accountants are engaged, a written report setting
forth its calculation of the disputed amounts and percentages. Upon such
delivery, such report and the calculations set forth therein shall be final and
binding upon Sellers and Purchasers. The cost of such review and report shall be
borne equally by Sellers and Purchasers.

               2.5 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything set forth in
this agreement, computations made to determine the Post-Closing Payments under
Section 2.4, "Net Worth", "EBITDA", "Net Sales", "Closing Net Worth" and "Target
Closing Net Worth" shall not include expenses relating to (i) bonuses that are
disclosed on Schedule 4.10 paid to any employees of Sellers (including the
Stockholders); or (ii) post-closing adjustment made by Purchasers to Sellers'
pre-closing financial accounting treatment of royalty advances or other funds
expended by Sellers in the ordinary course of business.

enforceable obligations of the Stockholders, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and other laws affecting creditors'
rights generally, from time to time, in effect and to general equitable
principles.

               3.3 Consents and Approvals. No filing with, and no permit,
authorization, license, consent or approval of, any Government Entity or any
other Person, other than the FTC and Justice Department under the HSR Act, is

Related Documents by any Stockholder and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents.

               3.4 No Conflict or Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any Related Document by any Stockholder, nor
the consummation by any Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, nor compliance by the Stockholders with any of the provisions hereof or
thereof, will (i) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, vesting, payment, exercise, acceleration,
suspension, revocation or modification) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, credit agreement, bond, mortgage, deed of trust,
security interest, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement, plan or other
instrument or obligation to which any Stockholder is a party or by which he or
any of his properties or assets may be bound or affected, or (ii) violate any
judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to any Stockholder or any of his properties or assets, except for
such violations, breaches, defaults, or rights of termination, cancellation,
acceleration, creation, imposition, suspension, revocation or modification as to
which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained prior to Closing and
copies of which have been delivered to Purchasers.

               3.5 Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge
of any Stockholder, threatened against or affecting any Stockholder, that could

               3.6 Investment Representation. Each Stockholder is an "accredited
investor" within the definition set forth in Rule 501(a) under the Securities
Act. Any JAKKS Shares acquired by the Stockholders following the distribution of
same by Sellers shall be acquired by the Stockholders for their own account, for
investment and not with a view to, or in connection with, or with any present
intention of, any resale or other disposition thereof.

        4. Representations and Warranties of the Stockholders and Sellers
concerning Sellers and the Play Along Business. The Stockholders and Sellers,
jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Purchasers and JAKKS as follows
concerning Sellers and the Play Along Business:

               4.1 Organization, Existence and Corporate Authority. Each Seller
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated or organized and has the
corporate power and authority and all necessary government licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and has been conducted over
the past twelve (12) months. Each Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

               4.2 Capitalization; Ownership of Other Entities. Schedule 4.2
sets forth the designations and numbers of all authorized and outstanding
capital stock, equity securities, membership interests or other securities of
each Seller, together with the name of the holder of record of such capital
stock, equity interests, membership interests or other securities. Except for
the securities set forth on Schedule 4.2, no Seller has any capital stock or
other equity securities outstanding. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.2, there
are no subscriptions, options, warrants, preemptive rights, or other rights of
any kind to purchase or otherwise receive (upon conversion, exchange or
otherwise) any capital stock or other equity securities of any Seller. Except as
set forth on Schedule 4.2, no Seller is a party to any voting trust, proxy or
other agreement, commitment or understanding with respect to the voting,
dividend rights or disposition of any of its respective capital stock or
membership interests. Sellers do not own, and do not have any agreements,
commitments or understandings to acquire, any capital stock or other securities
or any direct or indirect equity or ownership interest in any other Person.

               4.3 Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.3,
no filing with, and no permit, authorization, license, consent or approval of,
any Government Entity or any other Person, other than the FTC and Justice
Department under the HSR Act, is necessary for the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement or the Related Documents by any Seller and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Documents.

               4.4 No Conflict. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.4, neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any Related Document,
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (i)
conflicts with or results in any breach of any provisions of the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other comparable governing document of



                                       20
<PAGE>

any Seller, (ii) results in a violation or breach of, or constitutes (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or gives rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, vesting, payment, exercise, acceleration,
suspension, revocation or modification) under, any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of any note, credit agreement, bond, mortgage, deed of trust,
security interest, indenture, Contract, plan or other obligation to which any
Seller is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound or affected, (iii) violates any order, writ, injunction, decree or Law
applicable to Sellers or any of their respective properties or assets, (iv)
results in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on any asset of
Sellers' or (v) causes the suspension, revocation or modification of any permit,
license, governmental authorization, consent or approval necessary for any
Seller to conduct its business as currently conducted and as conducted over the
past twelve (12) months, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and
(v), for such violations, breaches, defaults or rights of termination,
cancellation, acceleration, creation, imposition, suspension, revocation or
modification as to which requisite waivers or consents have been obtained by
each Seller, as applicable, on or prior to Closing and copies of which have been
delivered to Purchaser.

               4.5 Extent of Assets. The Assets include, without limitation, all
of the real (immovable) and personal (movable) property, intangible
(incorporeal) property, rights and other assets of every kind and nature
whatsoever owned, leased or used by Sellers for the conduct of the Play Along
Business as currently conducted and as conducted during the past twelve (12)
months, excluding the Excluded Assets. The Assets, excluding the Excluded
Assets, constitute all the Assets necessary or desirable to design, produce,
manufacture, market, sell or distribute the Play Along Products. Sellers are the
legal and beneficial owners or lessees, as the case may be, of the Assets free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than the Permitted Liens and Sellers have
the full right, power and authority to sell, transfer, assign, convey and
deliver all of the Assets to Purchasers.

               4.6 Personal Property.

                      (a) Schedule 4.6(a) sets forth with respect to the Assets
and the Play Along Products (i) all items of personal property owned by Sellers,
except for items having an original cost of less than $10,000, and (ii) all
leases of personal property of Sellers, except where the aggregate annual rental
value of that lease is less than $17,500. Sellers have good and valid title to
all of the personal property purported to be owned by them free and clear of all
Encumbrances, except Permitted Liens. Sellers have delivered or made available
to Purchasers and JAKKS true and complete copies of all leases and other
agreements or documents affecting the personal property leased by Sellers and
pertaining to the Assets and the production of the Play Along Products, all of
which are valid and binding agreements of Sellers.

                      (b) Each item of personal property owned or leased by
Sellers, including all equipment which is currently used in the Play Along
Business and production of the Play Along Products is in Sellers' possession and
taking into account the age of such equipment, is in reasonably satisfactory
operating condition and repair, adequate for the uses and purposes for which it
is being used or intended, and is available for immediate use in the operation
of the Play Along Business, and, except as would be natural taking into account
the age of such equipment, none of such equipment requires maintenance or
repairs other than ordinary, routine maintenance and repairs.

                      (a) Schedule 4.7(a) lists all real property currently
owned or leased by Sellers and indicates all such real property to be conveyed
or assigned to Sellers by another Person prior to the Closing (the "Real
Property"). The Real Property is the only real property used in the operation of
the Play Along Business and none of the Real Property is owned by Sellers,
Stockholders or any of their respective Affiliates. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.7(a), the sale of the Assets to Purchasers and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement do not require the consent of
any of the landlords under the Real Property.

                      (b) Sellers have delivered to Purchasers true and correct
copies of all leases, together with all amendments and modifications thereof,
listed in Schedule 4.7(a), all of which are binding on Sellers, and with respect
to which Sellers, are current in their rent payments and are not otherwise in
default in any material respect.

                      (c) Sellers' present use of the Real Property is in
substantial conformity with all applicable Laws and with all deed restrictions,
and no Seller has received any notice of violation or alleged violation thereof.

                      (d) There are no material capital expenditures required to
be made by Purchasers in connection with the Real Property in order to comply
with all applicable Laws. No portion of the Real Property has suffered any
damage by fire or other casualty which heretofore has not been repaired or
restored and fully paid-for.

                      (e) All requisite certificates of occupancy and other
licenses, permits or authorizations with respect to the buildings, structures,
facilities (including any improvements thereto) on the Real Property and the
occupancy and use thereof have been obtained and are currently in effect.

                      (f) There are reasonable means of ingress and egress from
public roads to each parcel of Real Property.

                      (g) The Real Property has access to such Utilities as are
necessary for such property's occupation and use for the Play Along Business.

               4.8 Financial Statements.

Company's and PA Distribution's respective audited financial statements for the
fiscal years ended March 3l, 2003 and December 3l, 2003 as well as the Company's
and PA Distribution's respective unaudited balance sheets and related unaudited

4.8(a). The US Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with the books
and records of the Company and PA Distribution, fairly present in all material
respects their respective financial position and results of operations at and

consistently with prior periods except as otherwise noted in



                                       22

                      (b) Sellers have delivered to Purchasers copies of PA Hong
Kong's audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 3l, 2002
and December 3l, 2003, as well as PA Hong Kong's unaudited balance sheet and

Purchasers at Closing pursuant to Section 6.2(r).

               4.9 Indebtedness; Undisclosed Liabilities; Adverse Factors.
Schedule 4.9 sets forth all of Sellers' outstanding indebtedness for borrowed
money, whether secured or unsecured. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9, no
Seller is a party to any loan agreement or the maker or obligor under any
promissory note or other similar undertaking, including, without limitation, any
guaranty, for the repayment of borrowed money or the performance of any other
obligation. Sellers have no liabilities of any kind whatsoever, either accrued,
absolute, contingent, determined or determinable or otherwise, and to Sellers'
and Stockholders' knowledge no existing condition, situation or set of
circumstances has occurred that could reasonably result in such liabilities,
except for liabilities reflected or reserved against in the Financial
Statements, Schedules 2.1(c)(i)(B) and 2.1(c)(ii)(B), and current liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2004.
Notwithstanding the liabilities and obligations reflected in the Financial
Statements and except as set forth on Schedule 4.9, as of the date of this
Agreement the Stockholders have no obligation or liability of any nature to
Sellers or any of their Affiliates. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.9, there
are no Actions for indemnification asserted by any Person against any Seller
under any Law or agreement or pursuant to the articles of incorporation or
bylaws or corresponding articles of organization of any Seller, and the Sellers
have no knowledge any facts or circumstances that might give rise to the
assertion of any such Action. The Sellers have no knowledge of any event,
condition, set of facts or circumstances, which is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect that they have not disclosed to Purchasers.

                      (b) Each of the Sellers has used commercially reasonable
efforts to employ measures and precautions necessary to protect and maintain the
confidentiality and secrecy of all owned or licensed Trade Rights (except Trade
Rights whose value would be



                                       29
<PAGE>

unimpaired by public disclosure) and Sellers are not aware that any
confidentiality in relation to any Trade Right has been compromised.

by Sellers currently infringes or conflicts with any Trade Rights owned, used or
licensed by any other Person. Sellers are not infringing, misappropriating or
making any unlawful use of, and no Seller has, at any time infringed,
misappropriated or made any unlawful use of, or, to the knowledge of Sellers,
received any notice or other communication of any actual, alleged, possible or
potential infringement, misappropriation or unlawful use of, any Trade Rights
owned, used or licensed by any other Person. To the best knowledge of the
Sellers, no other Person is infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful

thereto; and (ii) no Seller has received any notice or other communication of
any claim by any customer or other Person alleging that any Trade Right owned or
used by any Seller (including each product extension, modification or derivative
thereof that has ever been licensed, sold or otherwise made available by any
Seller to any customer or potential customer) or the use thereof does not
conform in all material respects with any such specification or documentation,
and, to the best knowledge of the Sellers, there is no basis for any such claim.

                      (e) The Assets include all the Trade Rights necessary to
conduct the Play Along Business in the manner in which such business is being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement and has been conducted over the past

equity. Moreover, except as set forth on Schedule 4.17, to Sellers' knowledge
there is no Action pending or threatened against or affecting any Seller, the
outcome of which could reasonably be expected to impair the ability of any
Seller to perform their respective obligations hereunder or under the Related
Documents or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Documents.

other compensation that would not otherwise be payable absent the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Documents or
cause the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any award or
entitlement under any Employee Plan. No payment or benefit which will or may be
made by Sellers will be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within

of Section 280G of the Code.

indicate that any of the customers listed on Schedule 4.26(a) intends to cease
purchasing or dealing with Sellers, nor do Sellers have any knowledge that leads

respect the amount of purchases or the extent of dealings with Purchasers or

material respect its sales or service or dealings in the event of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

               4.27 OSHA Matters. No Seller has received any citation from the

representation or warranty by any Stockholder or Seller in this Agreement, the
Related Documents or any exhibit or schedule hereto or thereto, contains an
untrue statement of material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary

circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

been obtained or made.

               5.4 Litigation. To Purchasers' or JAKKS's knowledge, there is no
Action in writing pending against Purchasers or JAKKS or any significant

the prosecution or defense of Third Party Claims and collection of accounts
receivable and payment of accounts payable. Accordingly, Sellers and Purchaser
agree that for a period of seven (7) years after Closing (and such longer period
of time as indemnification obligations exist under Article 8), each will, at the
expense of the requesting party and upon written request, make available during
normal business hours to the other's agents, independent auditors and/or
Government Entities such documents and information as may be available relating
to the Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Obligations and the Excluded
Liabilities for periods prior and subsequent to Closing to the extent necessary
to facilitate the matters described above.

               7.2 Preservation and Access to Records Pertaining to the Assets
After the Closing. After the Closing, Purchasers shall, in the ordinary course
of business and as required by Law, keep and preserve all employee records and
other records of the Sellers' operations existing as of the Closing and which
constitute a part of the Assets delivered to Purchasers at Closing; provided
that, Purchasers, at any time after the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date,
upon not less than sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the Company, on
behalf of Sellers, may dispose of such records in its possession relating to the
Assets or any of the transactions contemplated herein, in accordance with
Purchasers' record retention policies and applicable Law; provided further, that
the Company, on behalf of Sellers, may, at its own cost and expense, retain, or
make arrangements for the retention of, such records to which they would have a
right of access under this Section 7.2, if the Company, on behalf of Sellers,
notifies Purchasers in writing that Sellers desire to retain such records. Upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours at the sole cost and expense of
Sellers and upon Purchasers' receipt of appropriate consents and authorizations,
Purchasers shall afford to the representatives of the Company, on behalf of
Sellers, including its counsel and accountants, full and complete access to, and
copies of, the records transferred to Purchaser at the Closing. Any access to
the records of the Assets or



                                       43
<PAGE>

Purchasers' personnel granted to the Company, on behalf of Sellers, in this
Agreement shall be upon the condition that any such access shall be conducted in
a manner by the Company so as not to materially interfere with the business
operations of Purchasers.

               7.3 Litigation Cooperation. After the Closing and subject to the
provisions of Article 8 hereof, upon prior reasonable written request and with
the reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid by the party making
the request, each party shall cooperate with the other in furnishing
information, testimony and other assistance in connection with any Actions, Tax
audits, or arrangements involving any of the parties hereto (other than in
connection with disputes between the parties hereto) and based upon contracts,
arrangements or acts of any party or any of their Affiliates that were in effect
or occurred on or prior to Closing or that related to the Assets, including,
without limitation, arranging discussions with, and the calling as witnesses of,
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of the parties
hereto.

               7.4 Allocation of Closing Purchase Price. After the Closing, the
parties shall cooperate in good faith to agree on a fair and reasonable
allocation of the Closing Purchase Price among the Assets, which allocation
shall take into account Schedule 6.2(l) hereto, as required by Section 1060 of
the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and any applicable
foreign law. If the parties do not reach agreement on such allocation within ten
(10) Business Days from the Closing Date, the specific matters in dispute among
the parties regarding such allocation shall be submitted to the Arbitrating
Accountants, which firm shall make a final and binding determination as to such
matter or matters. The Arbitrating Accountants shall deliver to the parties
their written determination regarding the matters submitted to them within ten
(10) Business Days, which determination shall be binding and conclusive upon all
parties with respect to the allocation of the Closing Purchase Price. Fees and
expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be paid 50% by Purchasers and 50%
by Sellers. Upon determination of the allocation of the Closing Purchase Price
in accordance with this Section 7.4, Sellers and Purchasers shall file all
required information and tax returns (and any amendments thereto) in a manner
consistent with this Section 7.4 and comply with the information reporting
requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder and any applicable foreign law. If, contrary to the intent of the
parties hereto as expressed in this Section 7.4, any U.S. or foreign taxing
authority makes or proposes an allocation different from that contained in this
Section 7.4, Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate with each other in good
faith to contest such taxing authority's allocation (or proposed allocation);
provided, however, that, after consultation with the party adversely affected by
such allocation (or proposed allocation), another party hereto may file such
protective claims or returns as may reasonably be required to protect its
interests. JAKKS agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers from
any Losses arising out of or resulting from any reallocation of the Closing
Purchase Price among the Assets that is required by any U.S. or foreign taxing
authority.

               7.5 Additional Covenants relating to Employees and Employee
Benefits.

                      (a) Employment of U.S. Employees. As of or prior to the
Closing, but subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, JAKKS US shall offer full-time or temporary employment to (or
cause AdvanTech to offer or continue full-time or temporary employment of, and
obtain from AdvanTech pursuant to the service agreement referred to in Section
6.3(k) the services of) each of the individuals who is co-



                                       44
<PAGE>

employed by the Company and PA Distribution, other than the Stockholders who are
entering into the Employment Agreements, on the Closing Date and identified on
Schedule 7.5(a) hereto (each, a "US Offer Employee"), in accordance with the
following provisions: (i) the date on which the employment by Purchasers (or
first receipt by Purchasers through AdvanTech of the services of) each US Offer
Employee who accepts such offer of employment shall become effective (the "US
Effective Date of Employment") shall be the first day after the Closing Date
(each such US Offer Employee who becomes so employed by (or whose services are
supplied by AdvanTech to) JAKKS US hereinafter being referred to as a "US Hired
Employee" from and after the US Effective Date of Employment), (ii) the initial
salary and base wage compensation payable to each US Hired Employee as of the US
Effective Date of Employment shall be not less than the amount set forth on
Schedule 4.18(c) for such US Hired Employee, (iii) JAKKS US shall (or shall
cause AdvanTech to) provide the US Hired Employees with employee benefits that
are, in the aggregate, comparable to those benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of JAKKS, (iv) JAKKS US shall (or shall cause AdvanTech to)
credit for purposes of such employee benefits (including vacation and all other
terms and conditions of employment dependent in whole or in part on service or
seniority) all applicable service of such US Hired Employees with the Company
and PA Distribution, and (v) for each US Offer Employee on leave of absence as
of the Closing Date, or who was terminated prior to the Closing Date subject to
reemployment or reinstatement rights in effect as of the Closing Date, JAKKS US
shall (or shall cause AdvanTech to) reemploy or reinstate such US Offer Employee
as a US Hired Employee to the same extent as the Company or PA Distribution
would be required to reemploy or reinstate such individual but for the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

                      (b) The Company's and PA Distribution's Obligations. Prior
to Closing, the Company and PA Distribution shall provide written notice, which
notice shall be subject to JAKKS US's prior review and approval, to all of their
respective employees indicating that their employment by the Company and PA
Distribution, as the case may be, shall terminate at the close of business on
the Closing Date; provided, that, with respect to employees employed or
co-employed by AdvanTech such notice may be provided by, or be subject to the
prior review and approval of, AdvanTech.

                      (c) Purchasers' Obligations. At Closing, JAKKS US shall
undertake those activities as may be required by Paychex to complete the
transfer to JAKKS of sponsorship of the Play Along, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing
Plan (the "Company Plan") as of the Effective Time, and shall assume the rights
and obligations of sponsor and employer under any other Employee Plan (if any)
sponsored by the Company and PA Distribution (other than an Employee Plan (A)
maintained by AdvanTech or (B) to the extent that it is for the benefit of any
or all of the Stockholders or their respective dependents) immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Nothing in this subsection (d) shall restrict the right of
JAKKS US or JAKKS to amend, merge, or terminate the Company Plan or any other
Employee Plan (if any) assumed as set forth above, at any time after the
Closing.

                      (d) WARN. Since JAKKS US agrees to offer employment to all
of the US Offer Employees, the actions to be taken hereunder with respect to the
Company and PA Distribution's employees are not anticipated to create any
liability or obligation with respect to the WARN Act, and the Company and PA
Distribution will have no obligation to provide the



                                       45
<PAGE>

Hired Employees and appropriate state and local government units with notice
under the WARN Act. In the event that an issue arises under the WARN Act as a
result of JAKKS US's actions following the Closing Date, JAKKS US agrees to
indemnify and hold the Company and PA Distribution harmless for any and all
liability, defense costs and attorneys' fees, as well as backpay, that the
Company and PA Distribution may incur in connection with claims or litigation
relating to the WARN Act.

                      (e) AdvanTech Obligations. JAKKS US shall assume from
Sellers, the Company and PA Distribution all liability, responsibility and
obligations for obligations to AdvanTech or employees (including unemployment
compensation and COBRA continuation coverage to the extent such obligations
arise under the service agreements between AdvanTech and Sellers), if any, that
would otherwise be a liability of Sellers, the Company or PA Distribution under
Sections 8(D) and 8(E) of the AdvanTech service agreements in effect with
Sellers, the Company or PA Distribution immediately prior to Closing in the
event of termination of such AdvanTech service agreements.

                      (f) HK Employees. As of or prior to the Closing, PA Hong
Kong and JAKKS HK shall jointly inform each of the individuals who is employed
by PA Hong Kong and identified on Schedule 7.5(f) hereto (each, a "HK Offer
Employee") of the sale of the Assets hereby agreed and will issue a joint letter
in accordance with the following provisions: (i) giving notice of termination of
his employment with PA Hong Kong with effect from the first day after the
Closing Date (the "HK Effective Date of Employment"), and (ii) containing an
offer by JAKKS HK of re-engagement with immediate effect of each HK Offer
Employee on terms no less favorable than the existing terms of employment;
provided, that, the initial salary and base wage compensation payable to each HK
Hired Employee as of the HK Effective Date of Employment shall be not less than
the amount set forth in Schedule 4.18(c) for such HK Hired Employee. Each such
HK Offer Employee who becomes so employed by JAKKS HK hereinafter being referred
to as a "HK Hired Employee" from and after the HK Effective Date of Employment.

                      (g) HK Retirement Scheme.

                             (i) If all HK Offer Employees accept the offer of
employment made by JAKKS HK and become HK Hired Employees pursuant to Section
7.5(f) hereof, then, (A) in respect of such HK Hired Employees and subject to
the agreement of the trustee of the PA Hong Kong Scheme, PA Hong Kong agrees to
assign to JAKKS HK, and JAKKS HK agrees to assume, all the rights, obligations
and liabilities of PA Hong Kong under the PA Hong Kong Scheme with effect from
the HK Effective Date of Employment (and for the purpose of this Section, the PA
Hong Kong Scheme shall be referred to as the "JAKKS HK Scheme" after the
assignment); (B) for the purpose of the participation of each HK Hired Employee
under the JAKKS HK Scheme, JAKKS HK agrees that the years of service of the HK
Hired Employee with JAKKS HK shall include the years of service of such HK Hired
Employee with PA Hong Kong; and (C) JAKKS HK agrees to execute such documents as
may be necessary to give effect to the assignment provided herein.

                             (ii) If there is any HK Offer Employee who does not
accept the offer of employment made by JAKKS HK under Section 7.5(f) hereof,
then, JAKKS HK



                                       46
<PAGE>

undertakes to establish its own mandatory provident fund scheme (the "New JAKKS
HK Scheme") by participating in a Master MPF Scheme and enroll the HK Hired
Employees as members of the New JAKKS HK Scheme with effect from the HK
Effective Date of Employment. JAKKS HK further agrees and undertakes that the
terms of the retirement benefits provided to the HK Hired Employees under New
JAKKS HK Scheme shall be no less favorable than those provided under the PA Hong
Kong Scheme. For the purpose of the participation of each HK Hired Employee
under the New JAKKS HK Scheme, JAKKS HK agrees that the years of service of the
HK Hired Employee with JAKKS HK shall include the years of service of such HK
Hired Employee with PA Hong Kong, and JAKKS HK shall procure the trustee of the
JAKKS HK Scheme to give effect to the same.

                      (h) No Rights to Employees. Notwithstanding any provision
herein, no term of this Agreement shall be deemed to create any contract between
any Purchaser or JAKKS and any employee that gives the employee the right to be
retained in the continued employment of any Purchaser or any related employer.
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and employees and former employees
of Sellers (other than the Stockholders) are not intended to be and shall not be
construed as beneficiaries hereof.

               7.6 Delivery of Property Received by Sellers or Purchasers After
Closing. Sellers agree that they will transfer or deliver to Purchasers,
promptly after the receipt thereof, any cash or other property which any Seller
receives after the Closing Date in respect of any Assets transferred or intended
to be transferred to Purchasers under this Agreement. In addition, Purchasers
agree that they will transfer or deliver to the Company, on behalf of Sellers,
promptly after receipt thereof, any property which Purchasers receive after the
Closing Date in respect of any Excluded Assets not transferred or intended to be
transferred to Purchasers under this Agreement.

               7.7 JAKKS Appointed Attorney for Sellers. Sellers, effective at
the Closing Date, hereby constitute and appoint JAKKS, its successors and
assigns, the true and lawful attorney of Sellers, in the name of either JAKKS or
Sellers (as JAKKS shall determine in its sole discretion) but for the benefit of
JAKKS: (i) to institute and prosecute all proceedings which JAKKS may deem
proper in order to collect, assert or enforce any claim, right or title of any
kind in or to the Assets as provided for in this Agreement; and (ii) to defend
or compromise any and all Actions, in respect of any of the Assets, and to do
all such acts and things in relation thereto as JAKKS shall deem advisable;
provided, that, in no event shall this appointment apply with respect to the
indemnification matters set forth in Article 8. Sellers acknowledge that the
foregoing powers are coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable. JAKKS
shall be entitled to retain for its own account any amounts collected pursuant
to the foregoing powers, including any amounts payable as interest in respect
thereof. JAKKS agrees to act in good faith in seeking to collect, assert or
enforce any Action against any third party in accordance with this Section 7.7.

               7.8 Payment of Liabilities. Following the Closing Date,
Purchasers and Sellers agree to discharge in accordance with their terms the
Assumed Obligations and the Excluded Liabilities, respectively.



                                       47
<PAGE>

               7.9 Taxes.

                      (a) Tax Returns Through Closing Date. Sellers shall
prepare and file on a timely basis all Tax Returns relating to the Assets with
respect to all periods through and to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to
be paid when due all Taxes relating to the Assets for such periods, except as
otherwise assumed by Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement.

                      (b) Subsequent Liability. If, subsequent to the Closing
Date, any liability for Taxes relating to the Assets or the conduct of Sellers
and/or the Stockholders is imposed on Purchasers and/or JAKKS with respect to
any period prior to and including the Closing Date, then, Sellers and
Stockholders, unless the liability is reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet, is
disclosed on Schedule 4.11(a) or otherwise relates to any additional Taxes (but
specifically excluding any related interest, fines or penalties) levied with
respect to PA Hong Kong's business operations as reflected in its fiscal 2003
and March, 2004 Tax Returns, shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold
Purchasers and JAKKS harmless, from and against, and shall pay, the full amount
of, such Tax liability (as well as reasonable attorneys', accountants' or other
fees and disbursements of Purchasers and JAKKS incurred in determination thereof
or in connection therewith as provided in Section 8.4), or Sellers shall, at
their sole expense and in their reasonable discretion, settle any Tax claim that
may be the subject of indemnification under this Section 7.9(b) at such time and
on such terms as they shall deem appropriate or assume the entire defense
thereof; provided, that, Sellers shall not in any event take any position in
such settlement or defense that subjects Purchasers, JAKKS or their Affiliates
to any civil fraud or any civil or criminal penalty. If, subsequent to the
Closing Date, any additional liability for Taxes (but specifically excluding any
related interest, fines or penalties) is imposed on PA Hong Kong concerning its
business operations as reflected in its fiscal 2003 and March, 2004 Tax Returns,
then JAKKS HK shall indemnify and hold PA Hong Kong harmless, from and against,
and shall pay, the full amount of, such additional Tax liability (with the
exception of any related interest, fines or penalties) but PA Hong Kong shall be
solely responsible for any reasonable attorneys', accountants' or other third
party fees and disbursements incurred by JAKKS HK (in consultation with PA Hong
Kong) in the settlement or defense of such matter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall not consent, without the prior written consent of
Purchasers and JAKKS, to any change in the treatment of any item which would, in
any manner whatsoever, adversely affect the tax liability of Purchasers, JAKKS
or their Affiliates for a period subsequent to the Closing Date.

                      (c) Certain Taxes. Except for any Taxes and fees payable
with respect to the issuance of the JAKKS Shares at Closing, which Taxes and
fees shall be the responsibility of JAKKS, all transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Sellers when due. Sellers will,
at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable Law, Purchasers will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

               7.10 Third Party Consents.

                      (a) In the event that as of the Closing Date any required
consents, approvals and waivers have not been obtained by the parties, the
Stockholders, Purchasers and Sellers will cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable following
Closing all consents, approvals and waivers which have not been obtained as of
the Closing Date required by third Persons to transfer the Assumed Contracts in
a manner that will avoid any default, conflict or termination of rights under
the Assumed Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.10(a) shall require the Stockholders,
Purchasers or Sellers to expend any material sum, make a material financial
commitment or grant or agree to any material concession to any third Person to
obtain any such consent, approval or waiver.

                      (b) In the event that any and all consents, approvals or
waivers necessary for the assignment, transfer or novation of any Assumed
Contract, or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, or consents relating to sale of substantially all of the Assets,
shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing Date, then as of the Closing,
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Law, shall constitute full and
equitable assignment by Sellers to Purchasers of all of Sellers' right, title
and interest in and to, and all of Sellers' obligations and liabilities as of
the Effective Time under, such Assumed Contract, and Purchasers shall each be
deemed Sellers' agent for purposes of completing, fulfilling and discharging the
Assumed Obligations under any Assumed Contract. The parties shall take all
reasonably necessary steps and actions to provide Purchasers with the benefits
of such Contracts, and to relieve Sellers of the performance and other
obligations thereunder arising after the Effective Time. Purchasers agrees to
pay, perform and discharge, and Purchasers agree to indemnify Sellers against
and hold Sellers harmless from, all obligations and liabilities of Sellers
relating to such performance or failure to perform under such Contracts arising
after the Effective Time. To the extent required in order to obtain a consent,
approval or waiver to the transfer of any Contract described in Section 7.10(a),
JAKKS agrees to pay, perform and discharge all obligations and liabilities of
Sellers relating to such performance or failure to perform under any such
Contract arising after the Effective Time.

                      (c) In the event Sellers shall be unable to make the
equitable assignment described in Section 7.10(b), or if such attempted
assignment would give rise to any right of termination, or would otherwise
adversely affect the rights of Sellers or Purchasers under such Contract, or
would not assign all of Sellers' rights thereunder at the Closing, Sellers and
Purchasers shall continue to cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to provide
Purchasers with all such rights. To the extent that any such consents and
waivers are not obtained, or until the impediments to such assignments are
resolved, Sellers shall use all reasonable efforts to (i) provide to Purchasers,
at their request, the benefits of any such Contract, (ii) cooperate in any
lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Purchasers, and (iii)
enforce, at the request of and for the account of Purchasers, any rights of
Sellers arising from any such Contract against any third Person, including the
right to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advise
of Purchasers. To the extent that Purchasers are provided the benefits of any
Contract referred to herein (whether from Sellers or otherwise), Purchasers
shall perform the obligations of Sellers thereunder, and Purchasers agree to
pay, perform and discharge, and



                                       49
<PAGE>

Purchasers agree to indemnify Sellers against and hold Sellers harmless from,
all obligations and liabilities of Sellers relating to such performance or
failure to perform (but only to the extent such obligations or liabilities arise
solely from acts of Purchaser after the Effective Time).

               7.11 Intellectual Property Matters. The Stockholders'
Representative will promptly perform all acts and execute all documents,
irrevocable powers of attorney, certificates, affidavits, instruments and
agreements, including instruments of assignment in forms suitable for recording
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, The United States Register
of Copyrights or any corresponding foreign office or agency, requested by the
Purchaser at any time to evidence, maintain, record, perfect, document or
enforce the Purchaser's interest in the Trade Rights set forth on Schedule
4.15(a) or otherwise in furtherance of the provisions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

               7.12 Post-Closing Management of Play Along Business

                      (a) During the Earn-out Period, provided that as of the
end of the most recently completed Review Period there is no decline in the
Adjusted Gross Profit as compared to the end of the prior Review Period (except
with respect to the Adjusted Gross Profit for the 2004 Review Period, which will
be compared to the Base), JAKKS and Purchasers, acting in good faith, shall (i)
operate and permit the Stockholders as employees of JAKKS or a Purchaser to
operate the Play Along Business in the manner substantially similar to the
manner that the Play Along Business was operated during the twenty-four month
period prior to the Effective Date (unless those practices are unreasonable and
not consistent with prudent business practices), subject to the other provisions
of Sections 7.12(a) and (b), and (ii) make funds, personnel and resources
available on a timely basis so that the covenant in clause (i) above can be
accomplished in a reasonable manner consistent with the amount and nature of
same as a percentage of sales that were expended or used in the operation of the
Play Along Business as operated as of the Closing Date or as set forth in the
projections attached as Schedule 7.12(a), and (iii) not take any action (other
than actions enforcing JAKKS' or a Purchaser's rights under any other agreement
between them and Sellers or Stockholders) that would have the reasonably
foreseeable consequence of reducing the Stockholders' ability as employees of
JAKKS or a Purchaser to operate the Play Along Business and Sellers' ability to
receive the Post-Closing Payments, and (iv) cause Purchasers to be maintained as
separate wholly-owned subsidiaries of JAKKS, which will be operated independent
of any other subsidiary of JAKKS and shall only sell Play Along Products. For
the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the
Related Documents to the contrary, the parties agree that, to the extent Sellers
have not obtained at Closing one or more consents to assignment required under
any of the Assumed Contracts, JAKKS and Purchasers shall be under no obligation
during the Earn-out Period to pay any consideration (whether in the form of a
one-time payment, increased royalty rate or guarantee or otherwise) or make any
other concession necessary to obtain the consent to assignment required under
those Assumed Contracts unless Purchasers and Stockholders agree that such
consideration or the economic effect of such concession shall become an
adjustment to EBITDA and/or Adjusted Gross Profit. During the Earn-out Period,
none of JAKKS or Purchasers will take any of the following actions without the
prior written approval of a majority of the Stockholders: (i) sell, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or a material portion of the consolidated assets of
Purchasers; or (ii) effect any transaction that would be a consolidation or


                                       50
<PAGE>


merger of Purchasers with or into any other corporation or corporations or the
sale, transfer or assignment of securities of Purchasers, unless the obligations
of JAKKS and Purchasers in this Section 7.12(a) are assumed by the transferee or
successor or surviving entity.

                      (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions on JAKKS and
Purchasers in Section 7.12(a), (i) each of Sellers and Stockholders acknowledge
that they will work with JAKKS and Purchasers to implement reasonable operating
efficiencies to the extent possible by consolidating certain general and
administrative, legal, accounting, warehousing and shipping functions and
overseas operations that are duplicated by JAKKS' and/or its Affiliates and
Seller's staff; provided, that, the implementation of any suggested change by
JAKKS and/or Purchasers pursuant to this Section 7.12(b), other than a change to
outside legal or accounting firms, shall be subject to the consent of a majority
of the Stockholders, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(the reasonableness of the granting or denial of such consent shall be
determined by whether the requested change would interfere in a material manner
with the maximization of Adjusted Gross Profit during the Earn-out Period);
provided, further, that the foregoing consent of the Stockholders shall be
required only for so long as there is no decline in the Adjusted Gross Profit as
of the end of the most recently completed Review Period as compared to the end
of the prior Review Period (except with respect to the Adjusted Gross Profit for
the 2004 Review Period, which will be compared to the Base), and (ii) such
restrictions shall not be applied in a manner that would interfere with JAKKS'
ability to implement such internal controls that satisfy the requirements of the
legislation known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the term "internal
controls" being used in the same manner as under such legislation, or with
JAKKS' ability to fulfill its reporting requirements under the Securities Act
and Exchange Act.

               7.13 Securities Law Filings. Sellers and the Stockholders shall,
and shall cause the accountants of Sellers' to, cooperate with JAKKS and its
accountants in the provision of such information and documents as may be
reasonably required in order to complete any filings required under the Exchange
Act or other United States securities laws or Blue Sky Laws relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. JAKKS shall reimburse Sellers'
accountants for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by them in providing
such cooperation.

               7.14 Transfer of Domain Names. Sellers shall respond
affirmatively to the request from the Registrar for the transfer of the Domain
Names within 24 hours of its receipt by Sellers, and provide all required
documentation in accordance therewith. Sellers do hereby covenant and agree with
Purchasers to provide, execute, or send such other information, electronic mail
messages, instruments or other documents and to take such other and further
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the transfer of the
Domain Names upon Purchasers' reasonable request. Sellers do hereby covenant and
agree with Purchasers that Purchasers may take control of the Domain Names
immediately upon transfer by Registrar.

               7.15 Company Name. Sellers expressly agree that, on and after the
Closing Date, no Seller shall have any right, title or interest in any trade
names, trademarks, identifying logos or service marks employing the words "Play
Along," or any variation thereof or any other trademarks, service marks, product
line names, trade dress or other Trade Rights included among the Assets or
confusingly similar thereto. Each Seller agrees that without the prior written
consent of Purchasers, neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall make any use
of the name "Play



                                       51

Along" or any variation thereof from and after the Closing Date. Each Seller
shall provide to Purchasers at Closing, for that Seller and each of its
subsidiaries, a certified copy of the board and stockholder resolutions
effectuating a name change as well as a fully executed amendment to its
Certificate of Incorporation (or equivalent document). Purchasers shall be
authorized to file such amendments on the Sellers' behalf at any time after the
Closing.

               7.16 Access Codes and Combinations. Immediately following the
Closing, Sellers and Stockholders shall cooperate with and notify Purchasers
with regard to all source and access codes to computers that are included among
the Assets and that Sellers are licensed and authorized to divulge, combinations
to safe(s) and the location of keys to safe deposit boxes, and vehicles, if any,
concerning the Play Along Business.

               7.17 Guaranty.

                      (a) JAKKS unconditionally guarantees the full and prompt
payment and performance, when due, and at all times thereafter, of all
obligations of Purchasers to Sellers or Stockholders under this Agreement and to
fund the respective financial obligations of Purchasers under each Stockholder's
Employment Agreement as well as the Related Documents to the extent JAKKS is not
a primary obligor thereunder ("JAKKS Guaranty"). This is a guaranty of payment
and performance and is not a guaranty of collection. JAKKS's obligations under
the JAKKS Guaranty will not be limited or abrogated by the waiver, consent,
extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence by Sellers or Stockholders
with respect to any provision or obligation under the Agreement. JAKKS hereby
waives any requirement of law that Sellers must exhaust any remedy against
Purchasers before proceeding against JAKKS.

                      (b) Each of the Stockholders unconditionally guarantees
the full and prompt payment and performance, when due, and at all times
thereafter, of all obligations of Sellers under this Agreement ("Stockholders
Guaranty"). This is a guaranty of payment and performance and is not a guaranty
of collection. Each of the Stockholder's obligations under the Stockholders
Guaranty will not be limited or abrogated by the waiver, consent, extension,
forbearance or granting of any indulgence by Purchasers or JAKKS with respect to
any provision or obligation under the Agreement. Each of the Stockholders hereby
waives any requirement of law that Purchasers and/or JAKKS must exhaust any
remedy against Sellers before proceeding against all or any of the Stockholders.

        8. Indemnification.

               8.1 By Sellers and Stockholders. In addition to their respective
indemnification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Sellers and
Stockholders, jointly and severally, will, subject to Sections 8.3 and 9.8,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser, JAKKS and their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, employees, agents and successors
and assigns from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities, expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel), Actions, Encumbrances
and other obligations whatsoever (individually a "Loss" and, collectively,
"Losses"), arising out of, resulting from or otherwise relating to (i) any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any of their respective
representations and warranties in this Agreement, the schedules or exhibits
hereto or in the Related Documents delivered by Sellers



                                       52
<PAGE>

and/or Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, with the exception of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.5 and 4.9, (ii) any
breach of any of their respective covenants and agreements in this Agreement,
the schedules or exhibits hereto or in the Related Documents delivered by
Sellers and/or Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) any inaccuracy,
misrepresentation or breach of their respective representations and warranties
in Sections 4.5 and 4.9 of this Agreement, and (iv) the Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities.

               8.2 By Purchasers and JAKKS. In addition to their respective
indemnification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Purchasers
and JAKKS, jointly and severally, will, subject to Sections 8.3 and 9.8, defend,
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and Stockholders and their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, stockholders, employees, agents, successors and
assigns from and against any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or
otherwise relating to (i) any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of any of
Purchasers' and JAKKS' representations and warranties in this Agreement, the
schedules or exhibits hereto or in the Related Documents delivered by Purchasers
and/or JAKKS pursuant to this Agreement, with the exception of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.7 and 5.8, (ii) any
breach of any of their respective covenants and agreements in this Agreement,
the schedules or exhibits hereto or in the Related Documents delivered by
Purchasers and/or JAKKS pursuant to this Agreement, including any of the
obligations or duties to or in relation to the employment of any of the HK Offer
Employees or HK Hired Employees following Closing (including any liability
arising out of the termination or dismissal of any HK Offer Employees or out of
any change of employer occurring by virtue of this Agreement), (iii) the
termination of employment of the HK Offer Employees with PA Hong Kong and the
transfer of their employment from PA Hong Kong to JAKKS HK, (iv) the transfer
and assignment of the PA Hong Kong Scheme (as defined in Section 7.5(g)) from PA
Hong Kong to JAKKS HK, and/or the transfer and assignment of any employee
benefits plan of the HK Offer Employees from PA Hong Kong to JAKKS HK, (v) any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of their respective representations and
warranties in Sections 5.7 and 5.8 of this Agreement, (vi) the Assumed
Obligations, and (vii) any Third Party Claims pertaining to Product Liability
and the Play Along Products except to the extent such Losses result from any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 4.22.

               8.3 Limitations.

                      (a) The Sellers and Stockholders shall be obligated to
indemnify for Losses (determined without regard to any materiality qualification
contained in any representation, warranty or covenant giving rise to a claim for
indemnity hereunder) arising out of, resulting from or otherwise relating to any
of the events described in clause (i) of Section 8.1 only to the extent that the
aggregate amount of such Losses exceed Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000). The
Purchasers and JAKKS shall be obligated to indemnify for Losses (determined
without regard to any materiality qualification contained in any representation,
warranty or covenant giving rise to a claim for indemnity hereunder) arising out
of, resulting from or otherwise relating to any of the events described in
clause (i) of Section 8.2 only to the extent that such Losses exceed Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000).

                      (b) In no event shall the aggregate indemnification
liability of Sellers and Stockholders pursuant to Section 8.1 exceed the sum of
$43,000,000; provided, however,



                                       53
<PAGE>

that such limitation shall not apply to any obligation to indemnify for Losses
from Actions brought on the basis of intentional misrepresentation or fraud or
Losses arising out of, resulting from or otherwise relating to the Excluded
Assets or Excluded Liabilities. In no event shall the aggregate indemnification
liability of Purchasers and JAKKS pursuant to Section 8.2 exceed $43,000,000;
provided, however, that such limitation shall not apply to any obligation to
indemnify for Losses from Actions brought on the basis of intentional
misrepresentation or fraud or Losses arising out of, resulting from or otherwise
relating to the Assumed Obligations.

                      (c) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement (whether pursuant to this Article 8 or otherwise)
shall be limited to the net after-tax effect of actual damages and shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to any insurance policy as a result of the Losses giving rise to
such indemnification payment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
in the absence of intentional misrepresentation or fraud no party shall be held
liable for consequential, special or punitive damages.

                      (d) In the event of the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, the schedules and
exhibits hereto or in the Related Documents, other than the right to bring an
action for intentional misrepresentation or fraud, the sole and exclusive right
and remedy of the parties hereto for money damages shall be a claim for
indemnification (i) pursuant to this Article 8 and/or (ii) as provided by the
specific covenant or agreement at issue.

               8.4 Procedural Matters.

                      (a) A party intending to claim indemnification under this
Agreement (whether pursuant to this Article 8 or otherwise) ("Indemnified
Party") must notify, in writing, the party from whom indemnification is sought
("Indemnifying Party") promptly after learning of any Loss, Action or any other
fact which, if true, would entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnification
under this Agreement (the "Notice of Claim"); provided, however, the Indemnified
Party's failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a defense (in whole
or in part) to any claim by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party
for indemnification, except and only to the extent that such failure shall have
caused or materially increased such liability or materially and adversely
affected the ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its
liability.

                             (i) A Notice of Claim shall set forth (A) a brief
description of the nature of the potential or actual Loss and (B) to the extent
then feasible the total amount of Loss anticipated (including any costs or
expenses that have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith).
Payment of the amount of actual Loss due the Indemnified Party as set forth in a
Notice of Claim shall be made by the Indemnifying Party no later than the
thirtieth (30th) day after the date of the Notice of Claim (or such later date
as the Indemnifying Party receives written notice that an actual Loss has
occurred), unless the provisions of subsection 8.4(a)(ii) are applicable.

                             (ii) If the Indemnifying Party (acting reasonably)
shall reject any Loss as to which a Notice of Claim is sent by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party



                                       54
<PAGE>

shall give written notice of such rejection to the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice of Claim. Upon such rejection, the
parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreement, and payment of
the amount of actual Loss shall be made by the Indemnifying Party within five
(5) days of mutual resolution of any disagreement. If any such disagreement
remains unresolved as of the forty-fifth (45th) day after receipt of the Notice
of Claim, the dispute shall be determined by an independent third party selected
jointly by Purchasers and Sellers, and the decision of such third party shall,
in the absence of manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. If the
Notice of Claim is determined by such third party to be proper, payment of the
amount of Loss due the Indemnified Party as set forth in the Notice of Claim
shall be made by the Indemnifying Party no later than the fifth (5th) business
day after such determination is rendered.

                      (b) As a condition precedent to any claim by an
Indemnified Party for indemnification under this Agreement for any Action
instituted by a third party the liability or the costs or expenses of which are
Losses (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party must tender the defense of
the Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party in the Notice of Claim. The
Indemnifying Party may undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party by notice to the
Indemnified Party not later than thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such
Third Party Claim.

                      (c) The Indemnifying Party's failure to confirm to the
Indemnified Party that it will undertake such defense shall be deemed to be a
waiver by the Indemnifying Party of its right to undertake the defense of that
Third Party Claim. If, however, the Indemnifying Party undertakes the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, (i) reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
the investigation and defense of that Third Party Claim and (ii) have the right
to participate in such investigation and defense; provided, that, the
Indemnifying Party will control the negotiation, tactics, trial, appeals and
other matters and proceedings related to that claim, except that the
Indemnifying Party will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, require the Indemnified Party to take or refrain from taking
any action, or make any public statement, which the Indemnified Party reasonably
considers to be against its interest, or consent to any settlement that requires
the Indemnified Party to make any payment that is not fully indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

                      (d) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, may undertake the defense of that claim with counsel of its
choosing and the Indemnifying Party in that event shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in the investigation and defense of
that Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party will control such
investigation and defense at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

                      (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 8.4
to the contrary, if both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are
named as parties or subject to such Third Party Claim and either such party
determines with advice of counsel that a material conflict of interest between
such parties may exist in respect of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party may decline to assume the defense on behalf of the Indemnified Party or
the Indemnified Party may retain the defense on its own behalf, and, in either
such case, after



                                       55
<PAGE>

notice to such effect is duly given hereunder to the other party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of any obligation to assume the defense on
behalf of the Indemnified Party, but shall be required to pay the out-of-pocket
legal costs and expenses (such as reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
of such defense; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable for such expenses on account of more than one separate firm of attorneys
(and, if necessary, local counsel) at any time representing such Indemnified
Party in connection with any Third Party Claim or separate Third Party Claim in
the same jurisdiction arising out of or based upon substantially the same
allegations or circumstances.

                      (f) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree
to make available to each other, their counsel and other representatives, all
information and documents available to them that relate to any Third Party
Claim, and to render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be
requested to ensure the proper and adequate defense of such Third Party Claim.

                      (g) Each Indemnified Party shall take commercially
reasonable actions to mitigate Losses, including pursuing insurance claims and
Third Party Claims, and shall reasonably consult and cooperate with each
Indemnifying Party with a view towards mitigating Losses, in connection with
claims for which an Indemnified Person seeks indemnification hereunder.

        9. Additional Provisions.

               9.1 Successors and Assigns, Assignability, Beneficiaries. This
Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of Sellers,
Purchasers and JAKKS and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Neither this Agreement nor any obligation hereunder will be assignable except
with the prior written consent of Purchasers and Sellers. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, Purchasers and JAKKS may assign all or any part of their
respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more
Affiliates, except as provided in Section 7.12. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person (other than the parties
or their respective successors and permitted assigns) any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

               9.2 Notices. All notices which are required by or may be given
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and must be delivered

Any of the addresses set forth above may be changed from time to time by written
notice from the party requesting the change.

        Such notices and other communications will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as being effective immediately if delivered personally or by

               9.3 Amendments and Waivers. The waiver, amendment or modification
of any provision of this Agreement or any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement, whether by agreement of the parties hereto or by custom, course of
dealing or trade practice, will not be effective unless in writing and signed by
the party or parties against whom enforcement of such waiver, amendment or
modification is sought. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or remedy with
respect to any of the provisions of this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such provisions or any other provisions.

               9.4 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision is held to be prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, such provision will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability. The remaining provisions
of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, and any such prohibition
or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto will
use their best efforts to replace the provision that is contrary to law with a
legal one approximating to the extent possible the original intent of the
parties.

               9.5 Exhibits. The schedules and exhibits that are attached to and
referred to in this Agreement are incorporated in and are an integral part of
this Agreement.

               9.6 Integration and Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the
Related Documents set forth the entire understanding between the parties,
supersede all previous and contemporaneous written or oral negotiations,
commitments, understandings, and agreements relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement and the Related Documents and merge all prior and contemporaneous
discussions between or among the parties or any of their respective Affiliates.

               9.7 Counterparts and Headings. For the convenience of the
parties, this Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including
by facsimile, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. All headings and captions
are inserted for convenience of reference only and will not affect the meaning
or interpretation of any provision in this Agreement.

               9.8 Survival. All representations and warranties of Stockholders,
Sellers, Purchasers and JAKKS made in this Agreement and the Related Documents
will survive the Closing for a period of twenty (20) months following the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the



                                       58
<PAGE>

foregoing, (i) the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.5 will
survive without time limit, and (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4.11, 4.14, 4.18, 5.2 and 5.8 will survive until six (6)
months after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation relating to
claims with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under Article 8 shall survive the time at which it would otherwise
terminate pursuant to this Section 9.8, if the Notice of Claim with respect to
the inaccuracy or breach giving rise to such right to indemnity shall have been
given to the Indemnifying Party prior to such time. This Section 9.8 shall not
limit any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

               9.9 Expenses. Stockholders and Sellers, jointly and severally,
and Purchasers and JAKKS will each pay the fees and expenses of their respective
counsel, accountants and other experts incident to the negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto and the Related
Documents; provided, that, Purchasers shall pay up to $500,000 of the legal and
accounting expenses of Sellers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the extent that the Closing Net Worth equals or exceeds the Target
Closing Net Worth.

               9.10 Interpretations. As used herein, the words "ordinary course"
or "ordinary course of business" means the ordinary course of commercial
operations customarily engaged in by Sellers consistent with past practices and
specifically does not include (i) the incurrence of any material liability for
any tort or any breach of or default under any Contract or Law, (ii) the failure
to meet obligations of Sellers as they become due or payable or (iii) any
actions or omissions by Sellers taken or not taken in contemplation of the
marketing or sale of the Play Along Business or Assets or any part thereof, or
of any merger, consolidation, tender offer or other business combination
involving all or any Seller. The qualification or limitation of any statement
made herein to a party's "knowledge" or to a matter "known" to a party refers to
such party's actual knowledge after reasonable inquiry and with respect to
Sellers, knowledge shall only refer to the actual knowledge after reasonable
inquiry of Jay Foreman, Charles Emby and Lawrence Geller, which reasonable
inquiry as to matters pertaining to Sellers' internal affairs and operations
shall be limited to the senior sales, licensing, financial and accounting
employees of each Seller and general manager of PA Hong Kong. As used herein
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by "including, without limitation,"
and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the
specific or similar items or matters immediately following it. As used herein,
words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such words appear
unless the context otherwise requires. Any reference in this Agreement to gender
shall include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.

               9.11 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and
cause to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments, powers of
attorney, and other documents, and shall take such other actions, as such other
party may reasonably request (prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose
of carrying out or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

               9.12 Confidentiality. Except as required by Law, the parties
hereto shall hold, and shall cause their respective officers and authorized
representatives and agents to hold, any non-public information obtained from the
other parties hereto in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with the provisions of, the Non Disclosure Agreement, dated January 14, 2004,
between the Sellers and JAKKS (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Moreover, on
and at all times after the Closing Date, the Stockholders and Sellers shall keep
confidential, and shall not use or disclose to any other Person, any non-public
document or other non-public information in their possession that relates to the
Play Along Business, the Assets, Purchasers or JAKKS. Notwithstanding any other
express or implied agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that each
of them and each of their employees, representatives and other agents may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to any of them
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, except where confidentiality
is reasonably necessary to comply with U.S. federal or state securities laws.
For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "tax treatment" and "tax structure"
have the meanings specified in Treasury Regulation section 1.6011-4(c).

               9.13 Risk of Loss. The risk of loss or damage to any of the
Assets subject hereto shall remain with Sellers until the Effective Time, and
Sellers shall maintain their respective insurance policies covering the Assets
through the Effective Time. All insurance proceeds (or rights thereto)
attributable to the damage, destruction or casualty loss of any of the Assets
prior to the Effective Time shall be included among the Assets assigned to
Purchasers at Closing.

               9.14 Public Announcements. No Seller shall issue, or permit any
of its agents or Affiliates to issue, any press releases or otherwise make, or
permit any of their respective agents or Affiliates to make, any public or other
statements, with respect to this Agreement, the Related Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby without the prior written consent
of Purchasers.

               9.15 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as set
forth in Article 8, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be
cumulative (and not alternative). The parties to this Agreement agree that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any party to this Agreement of
any covenant, obligation or other provision set forth in this Agreement for the
benefit of any other party to this Agreement, such other party shall be entitled
(in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it) to (i) a decree or
order of specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and
performance of such covenant, obligation or other provision, and (ii) an
injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

               9.16 Drafting. Each party acknowledges that its legal counsel
participated in the preparation of this Agreement. The parties stipulate,
therefore, that the rule of construction that ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party will not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement to favor any party against the other.

               9.17 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed, governed
and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.
