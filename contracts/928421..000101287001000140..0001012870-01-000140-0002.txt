        THIS STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of

                                   -------

        A.     On June 27, 2000, the Company and Stockholder entered into a
Strategic Business Combination Agreement (the "Combination Agreement") pursuant

Pennsylvania corporation ("CFM"), and M2C Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
                           ---

Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "CFM Merger Agreement") pursuant to which,
                                   --------------------
subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein, and concurrently
with the consummation of the STEAG Transaction, (i) M2C will merge with and into

        D.     The parties believe that it is in the best interests of the
Company, the Stockholder and Mattson to provide for certain rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to various corporate matters.

        NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

        1.     Board Representation; Executive Staffing; Nominating Committee;
               --------------------------------------------------------------

Company shall consist of seven (7) members, two of whom shall be designated by
Stockholder (the "Stockholder Representatives"), one of whom shall be the Chief
                  ---------------------------
Executive Officer of the Company and, subject to Section 1.1(b) below, the
remaining four of whom shall be incumbent Independent
<PAGE>

Directors (as such term and certain other capitalized terms are defined in
Section 8.11) as of the Effective Date, or successors, at least three of whom
shall be Independent Directors, nominated in accordance with the Company's
Bylaws, as amended from time to time (the "Bylaws").

Section 7.1), the Company shall cause the authorized size of the Board of
Directors to be increased to seven (7) members from five (5) members, and the
Company shall cause two (2) persons designated by Stockholder as the initial
Stockholder Representatives to be appointed to fill the two vacant seats so
created. One such initial Stockholder Representative shall be Dr. Jochen
Melchior, who shall be elected and appointed to the class of the Company's Board
of Directors scheduled to be elected at the third (3/rd/) Annual Meeting of the
Company's stockholders following the Closing (i.e., Class III). The other
                                              ----

and appointed to the class of the Company's Board of Directors scheduled to be
elected at the second (2nd) Annual Meeting of the Company's stockholders
following the Closing (i.e., Class II). If either Stockholder Representative or
                       ----
any successor thereto ceases to be a director of the Company at any time prior
to the expiration of such Stockholder Representative's designated term as
director, whether as a result of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or other cause, the Company shall cause a
successor designated by Stockholder to be elected and appointed to fill the
vacancy so created. The Company agrees that, at the request of Stockholder, as
soon as practicable following such request, it will cooperate with Stockholder
to attempt to remove any Stockholder Representative, to the extent permitted by
Delaware law, and to take any action reasonably requested by Stockholder for
that purpose including, without limitation, to call a stockholders meeting and
hold such meeting as soon as practicable following such request. Stockholder
Representatives who are not employees of the Company will receive the same
benefits and compensation as other non-employee directors of the Company.

Company's Board of Directors as a member of Class III of the Board of Directors,
in place of an incumbent Independent Director of the Company. If the CFM
Representative ceases to be a director of the Company prior to the expiration of
the CFM Representative's designated term as director, whether as a result of
death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other
cause, the vacancy so created shall be filled by the Company's Board of
Directors, in accordance with the Company's Bylaws, with an Independent Director
or other person unanimously approved by the Nominating Committee (as defined in
Section 1.2).

cause: (i) Dr. Jochen Melchior, a Stockholder Representative, to serve as
Chairman of the Board for a term of one (1) year, and (ii) Mattson to serve as

Executive Staffing Committee will remain in place for one year following the
Effective Date, and will be responsible during that period for making key
personnel decisions (including the hiring and firing of the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the
general managers for divisions). One (1) Independent Director reasonably
acceptable to Stockholder and the Company will be appointed as a tiebreaker
member of the Executive Staffing Committee in the event the committee reaches
deadlock on an issue or staffing decision.

                    (g)  The Company will cause the nomination of the
Stockholder Representatives for election as directors of the Company at each

"Issuance") for any reason whatsoever, Stockholder may purchase additional
 --------
shares of Voting Stock in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions (to the extent Stockholder has not already exercised its rights
pursuant to Section 3 below with respect to a particular Issuance) as required

Stock. Prior to any sale or issuance by the Company of any shares of Voting
-----
Stock (other than a sale or issuance described in Section 3.4) (a "Proposed
                                                                   --------
Issuance"), the Company shall give Stockholder advanced written notice (the
--------
"Notice of Issuance") of the Proposed Issuance, setting forth the proposed
 ------------------
price, quantity (which the Company may indicate is a fixed amount to be offered
to third parties, subject to increase to make allowance for issuance to
Stockholder) and other material terms and conditions under which the Company
proposes to make such sale (the date such notice is received by Stockholder is
hereinafter referred to in this Section 3.1 as the "Notice Date"). Stockholder
                                                    ------------
shall have the right, exercisable as hereinafter provided, to purchase its
proportional share of such Voting Stock (as defined below) on terms which are at
least as favorable to Stockholder as the terms on which the Company sells such
Voting Stock to any other prospective investor. Stockholder shall have twenty
(20) days after the Notice Date to notify the Company in writing that it elects
to purchase some or all of its share of the Voting Stock so offered. If any
material term of the Proposed Issuance is changed from those set forth in the
Notice of Issuance, the Company shall give Stockholder prompt written notice
(the "Revised Notice of Issuance") of the revised terms of the Proposed Issuance
      ----------------------------
setting forth the revised terms of the Proposed Issuance (the date such Revised
Notice of Issuance is received by Stockholder is hereinafter referred to in this
Section 3 as the "Revised Notice Date"). Stockholder shall have until the later
                  --------------------
of (x) five (5) days from the Revised Notice Date or (y) twenty (20) days from
the original Notice Date to notify the Company in writing that it elects to
purchase some or all of its share of the Voting Stock so offered. The
proportional share amount of Voting Stock which Stockholder is entitled to
acquire in the Proposed Issuance shall be equal to (i) the amount of Voting
Stock proposed to be sold or issued by the Company in the Proposed Issuance
(which the Company at its election may indicate to be a fixed amount to be
offered to third parties, subject to increase to make allowance for sales to
Stockholder) multiplied by (ii) a fraction calculated by dividing (A) the number
of shares of Voting Stock owned by Stockholder as of the Notice Date by (B) the
total number of shares of Voting Stock issued and outstanding as of the Notice
Date.

               3.2  Company Sale. If, within the later of twenty (20) days after
                    ------------
the Notice Date or five (5) days after the latest Revised Notice Date,
Stockholder does not notify the Company that it desires to purchase a portion of
the Voting Stock proposed to be sold or issued by the Company in a Proposed
Issuance, then the Company may, during a period of ninety (90) days following
the end of such twenty (20) day period or five (5) day period, as the case may
be, sell and issue such Voting Stock not otherwise purchased by Stockholder to
other third parties at a price and upon terms and conditions no more favorable
to such parties than those set forth in the Notice of Issuance.


               3.3  Purchase; Payment. If Stockholder elects to purchase Voting
                    -----------------
Stock from the Company pursuant to this Section 3, Stockholder and the Company
shall consummate the

                                       6
<PAGE>

purchase and sale of such Voting Stock in the manner and on the terms and date
of the closing of the Proposed Issuance as set forth in the Notice of Issuance
or Revised Notice of Issuance, as the case may be or, if on a later date, the
second (2nd) business day after all regulatory filings required for the
consummation of such purchase have been obtained. Payment for such Voting Stock
shall be by check (or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Company by written notice delivered to Stockholder not less
than two (2) business days prior to the scheduled closing of such purchase) or,
at Stockholder's election, to the extent practicable, such other form of
consideration as set forth in the Notice of Issuance or Revised Notice of
Issuance, as the case may be, against delivery of such Voting Stock at the
executive offices of the Company at the time of the scheduled closing therefor.
The Company shall take all such action as may reasonably be required by any
regulatory authority in connection with the exercise by Stockholder of the right
to purchase Voting Stock as set forth in this Section 3.

               3.4  Limitation. Stockholder's right to participate in a Proposed
                    ----------

of securities issued in connection with (A) any equipment financing in an amount
in excess of $10,000,000 or (B) any technology licensings, research or
development agreements or asset acquisitions approved by the Company's Board of
Directors;

                    (d)    Common Stock issued upon exercise of securities
issued pursuant to rights distributed to holders of Common Stock generally;

               4.4  Right of First Refusal on Permitted Sales by Stockholder.
                    --------------------------------------------------------

                    (a)  General. Prior to consummating any sale or transfer of
                         -------
any Voting Stock, except for sales or transfers described in Section 4.2(i)
through (iii), Stockholder shall give the Company the opportunity to purchase
such Voting Stock in the following manner:

                         (i)    Stockholder shall give notice (the "Transfer
                                                                    --------
Notice") to the Company in writing of such intention, specifying the names of
------
the proposed purchasers or transferees, the securities proposed to be sold or
transferred, the proposed price per share therefor (the "Transfer Price") and
                                                         --------------
the other material terms upon which such disposition is proposed to be made.

                         (ii)   The Company shall have the right, exercisable by
written notice given by the Company to Stockholder within twenty (20) days after
receipt of such Transfer Notice, to agree to purchase all, but not less than
all, of the securities specified in such Transfer Notice. The Company shall have
the right to pay for such securities: (a) the same amount in cash per share, if
the consideration to be paid by the third party consists of cash, or (b) to the
extent the consideration to be paid by the third party does not consist of cash,
consideration per share equivalent to that offered by the third party, or an
amount of cash having equivalent value as determined, at the expense of the
Company, by an investment banking firm mutually agreed to by the Company and
Stockholder.

                         (iii)  If the Company exercises its right of first
refusal hereunder, the closing of the purchase of the securities with respect to
which such right has been exercised shall take place within ten (10) days after
the Company gives notice of such exercise, or, if later, upon the date on which
the proposed transfer was to occur with the third party. Upon exercise by the
Company of its right of first refusal, the Company and Stockholder shall be
legally obligated to consummate the purchase contemplated thereby and shall use
their reasonable commercial efforts to secure any approvals required in
connection therewith. The Company may elect by notice in writing to Stockholder
that, at the closing of such transaction, the shares be delivered to and payment
made to Stockholder by a designee of the Company, provided that the Company
shall remain liable for its obligations under this Section 4.4.

                         (iv)   If the Company does not exercise its right of
first refusal hereunder within the time specified for such exercise, Stockholder
shall be free, subject to the terms of Section 4.3 herein, during the period of
one hundred and eighty (180) days following the expiration of such time for
exercise, to sell the securities specified in such Transfer Notice on terms no
less favorable to Stockholder than the terms specified in such Transfer Notice.

                    (b)  No Assignment. The rights of first refusal provided by
                         -------------
this Section 4.4 may not be assigned by the Company; provided, however, that the
Company may provide that a purchase of Voting Stock will be made by a designee
in accordance with Section 4.4(a)(iii).

               4.5  Affiliate Transfer; Obligation to Transfer Back. As a
                    -----------------------------------------------
condition to the permitted transfer of Voting Stock held by Stockholder to any
Affiliate of Stockholder (each, an 'Affiliate Holder'), such Affiliate Holder
must agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of

                                       9
<PAGE>

this Agreement and to hold such Voting Stock subject to all obligations and
restrictions applicable to Stockholder, including Sections 1.3, 2, 4 and 5.11
hereof, in which event such Affiliate shall be entitled to share, jointly with
Stockholder, the rights and benefits applicable to Stockholder under this
Agreement. If any Affiliate Holder ceases to be an Affiliate of Stockholder,
then not later than thirty (30) days following the date on which the control
relationship ends between such Affiliate Holder and Stockholder, such Affiliate
Holder shall transfer its Voting Stock to Stockholder or to an Affiliate of
Stockholder, or otherwise transfer such Voting Stock in accordance with Section
4 of this Agreement.

               4.6  Merger of Stockholder. For avoidance of doubt, nothing in
                    ---------------------
this Section 4 shall be deemed to prohibit a transfer of Voting Stock by
operation of law to a successor entity as a result of a merger involving
Stockholder.

          5.   Registration Rights.
               -------------------

               5.1  Definitions. For purposes of this Section 5:
                    -----------

                    (a)  The terms "Holder" or "Holders" means Stockholder
                                    ------      -------
and/or any other person who shall subsequently own or have the right to acquire
Registrable Securities or any assignee thereof in accordance with Section 5.10
hereof.

                    (b)  The terms "register," "registered" and "registration"
                                    --------    ----------       ------------
refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a registration
statement or similar document in compliance with the Securities Act, and the
declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such registration statement or
document.

                    (c)  The term "Registrable Securities" means (i) any shares
                                   ----------------------
of Common Stock issued by the Company to Stockholder pursuant to the Combination
Agreement or subsequently acquired by Stockholder in compliance with Section 3
of this Agreement; (ii) any and all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
upon exercise, conversion or exchange of equity securities acquired by
Stockholder in compliance with Section 3; (iii) equity securities issued in lieu
thereof in any reorganization; or (iv) equity securities issued in respect of
the stock referred to in (i) or (ii), above, as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization or the like, excluding in all cases, however, any of
the foregoing sold by a Holder pursuant to a registration statement, in a
transaction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, or in any
other transaction in which registration rights are not transferred pursuant to
this Section 5.

                    (d)  The number of shares of "Registrable Securities then
                                                  ---------------------------
outstanding" shall be determined by the number of shares of Common Stock
-----------
outstanding which are, and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
pursuant to then exercisable or convertible securities which are exercisable or
convertible into, Registrable Securities.

               5.2  Company Registration
                    --------------------

                    (a)  If (but without any obligation to do so) the Company
proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the
Company for stockholders other

                                       10
<PAGE>

than the Holders) any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act for sale
after the Lockup Period in connection with a secondary offering of such
securities solely for cash (other than a registration relating solely to the
sale of securities to participants in a Company stock option, stock purchase or
similar plan, or a registration relating solely to a transaction of the type
described in Rule 145(a) under the Securities Act), the Company shall, at such
time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration. Upon the
written request of any Holder given within twenty (20) days after mailing of
such notice by the Company in accordance with Section 8.3 of this Agreement, the
Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.2(b), include in such
registration (and any related qualification under blue sky laws or other
compliance) and in any underwriting involved therein, all of the Registrable
Securities that each such Holder has requested to be registered.

                    (b)  In connection with any offering involving an
underwriting of shares being issued by the Company, the Company shall not be
required under this Section 5.2 to include any Holder's securities in such
underwriting unless such Holder accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed
upon between the Company and the underwriters selected by it, and then only in
such quantity as will not, in the opinion of the underwriters, jeopardize the
success of the offering by the Company. In the event that any registration
pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be, in whole or in part, an underwritten
public offering of Registrable Securities, the number of shares of Registrable
Securities of the Holders to be included in such an underwriting may be reduced
(pro rata among the requesting Holders based upon the number of shares of
Registrable Securities then outstanding that are owned by such Holders) if and
to the extent that the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that
in its opinion such inclusion would materially adversely affect the marketing of
the securities to be sold by the Company therein. If any Holder disapproves of
the terms of any such underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by
written notice to the Company and the underwriter delivered at least seven (7)
days prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement. Any Registrable
Securities or other securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting
shall be withdrawn from such registration. The Holders shall have no right to
participate in the selection of the underwriters for an offering pursuant to
this Section 5.2.

                    (c)  The Company shall have the right to terminate or
withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 5.2 prior to the
effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Holder has elected to
include securities in such registration.

               5.3  Form S-3 Demand Registration.
                    ----------------------------

                    (a)  After the Lockup Period, Holders shall have the right
to request registrations on Form S-3 (such requests shall be in writing and
shall state the number of shares of Registrable Securities to be disposed of and
the intended methods of disposition of such shares by the Holders); provided,
                                                                    --------
however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
-------
registration: (i) with effectiveness prior to the end of the Lockup Period, (ii)
if the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) on Form S-3 at an aggregate price
to the public of less than $5,000,000, (iii) if the Company reasonably
determines, following consultation with its outside counsel, that a Holder's
sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement would
require disclosure of material information

                                       11
<PAGE>

and such disclosure would be materially detrimental to the Company, but only for
so long as such disclosure is required and would be materially detrimental; (iv)
in a given twelve-month period, after the Company has effected one (1) such
registration pursuant to this Section 5.3 in any such period; or (v) within
sixty (60) days of the effective date of a Company registration statement of the
type described in Section 5.2 involving an underwritten offering, or within one
hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of a registration statement in
which the Holders shall have been entitled to participate pursuant to Section
5.2 hereto and in which there shall have been effectively registered all of the
Registrable Securities as to which registration shall have been requested by the
Holders, if any; provided; however, that the Company may not postpone any
                 --------  -------
registration pursuant to clause (iii) above for more than 60 days from the date
of such request; and, provided, further that such right to delay a request shall
                      --------  -------
be exercised by the Company not more than once in any twelve-month period.

                    (b)  Following receipt of any notice from Holders initiating
a request for registration in accordance with Section 5.3(a), the Company shall
use its best efforts to register under the Act, for public sale in accordance
with the method of disposition specified in such notice from Holders, the number
of shares of Registrable Securities specified in such notice and in all notices
received by the Company. If such method of disposition shall be an underwritten
public offering, the Holders may designate the managing underwriter of such
offering, subject to the approval of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If and to the extent the managing underwriter
of any underwritten public offering conducted pursuant to this Section 5.3
advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the amount of securities
requested to be included in such offering is sufficiently large to materially
adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by the stockholders
therein, the amount of securities to be included in such offering by Persons
other than the Holders shall be reduced.

                    (c)  Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3(b) above, the
Company shall be entitled to include in any registration statement referred to
in this Section 5.3, for sale in accordance with the method of disposition
specified by the requesting Holders, shares of Common Stock to be sold by the
Company for its own account, except as and to the extent that, in the opinion of
the managing underwriter (if such method of disposition shall be an underwritten
public offering), such inclusion would adversely affect the marketing of the
Registrable Securities to be sold. Except for registration statements on Form S-
4, Form S-8 or any successor forms thereto, the Company will not file with the
Commission any other registration statement under the Act with respect to its
Common Stock, whether for its own account or that of other stockholders, from
the date of receipt of a notice from requesting Holders pursuant to this Section
5.3 until the completion of the period of distribution of the registration
contemplated thereby.

               5.4  Obligations of the Company. Whenever required under this
                    --------------------------
Agreement to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company
shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

                    (a)  prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement with respect to such Registrable Securities within 45 days after
receipt of requisite requests from Holders for registration and use its best
efforts to cause such registration statement to become

                                       12
<PAGE>

effective and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for
the period of the distribution contemplated thereby (determined as hereinafter
provided);

                    (b)  prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to keep the
registration statement effective for the period specified in paragraph (a) above
and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;

                    (c)  furnish to the Holders of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement such numbers of copies of a prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order
to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

                    (d)  use its best efforts to register and qualify the
securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or
Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be requested by the Holders
thereof, provided that (i) the Company shall not be required in connection
         --------
therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a
general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions and
(ii) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
any jurisdiction in which the securities shall be qualified imposes a non-
waivable requirement that expenses incurred in connection with the qualification
of the securities be borne by selling stockholders, such expenses shall be
payable pro rata by selling stockholders;

                    (e)  in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter
into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering. Each Holder
participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its
obligations under such an agreement;

                    (f)  promptly notify each Holder participating in the
registration covered by such registration statement at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act
of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in
such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances then existing and at the request of any Holder, within 5 days,
prepare and furnish to such Holder so requesting a reasonable number of copies
of a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so
that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities,
such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading; provided that, if the Company reasonably determines, following
consultation with its outside counsel, that such a supplement or amendment would
require disclosure of material information and such disclosure would be
materially detrimental to the Company, then upon written notice to participating
Holders to that effect, each Holder shall suspend any sales or trades of the
Company's securities under any

                                       13
<PAGE>

registration statement for so long as the Company determines such disclosure is
required and materially detrimental, but in any case not longer than thirty (30)
days immediately following such notice;

                    (g)  cause all such Registrable Securities registered
pursuant to this Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or national
market system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed
or traded;

                    (h)  furnish, at the request of any Holder requesting
registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, (i) such
representations and warranties to such Holder and the underwriters, if any, as
is customary in primary underwritten offerings, (ii) an opinion, dated such
date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in
an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, and (iii) a
letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the
Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified
public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed
to the underwriters;

                    (i)  make available upon reasonable notice for inspection by
each seller of Registrable Securities, any underwriter participating in any
distribution pursuant to such registration statement, and any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by such seller of Registrable Securities or
underwriter, all pertinent financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with
preparation and verification of such registration statement;

                    (j)  otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security
holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the
period of at least twelve months, but not more than eighteen (18) months,
beginning with the first month after the effective date of the registration
statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act; and

                    (k)  take such other actions as are reasonably required in
order to expedite or facilitate the sale of such Registrable Securities,
including, without limitation, causing management of the Company to participate
in "road show" presentations.

               For purposes of Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), the period of
distribution of Registrable Securities in a firm commitment underwritten public
offering shall be deemed to extend until each underwriter has completed the
distribution of all securities purchased by it, and the period of distribution
of Common Stock in any other registration shall be deemed to extend until the
earlier of the sale of all Common Stock covered thereby or 120 days after the
effective date thereof.

               5.5  Provision of Information. It shall be a condition precedent
                    ------------------------
to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to this Section 5
that the selling Holders

                                       14
<PAGE>

shall furnish to the Company such information regarding themselves, the
Registrable Securities held by them and the intended method of disposition of
such securities as shall be required to effect the registration of the
Registrable Securities.

               5.6  Expenses of Registration. All expenses other than
                    ------------------------
underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with
registrations, filings or qualifications of Registrable Securities pursuant to
Sections 5.2 and 5.3, including (without limitation) all registration, filing
and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company, and the reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel for the participating Holders, shall be borne by the Company.

               5.7  Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are
                    ---------------
included in a registration statement under this Agreement:

                    (a)  To the extent permitted by law, the Company will
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of such Registrable Securities, the
officers and directors of each such Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the
Securities Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such
Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to
which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a
"Violation"): (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
 ---------
fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or
supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the

state securities law; and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, officer
or director, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the
                                               --------  -------
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5.7(a) shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), nor shall the Company be liable in any
such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent
that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in
connection with such registration by any such Holder, officer, director,
underwriter or controlling person.

                    (b)  To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder,
severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of
its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement,
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities Act, any underwriter and any other Holder selling securities in such
registration statement or any of its directors or officers or any person who
controls such Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint
or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, controlling
person, underwriter, or other such Holder

                                       15
<PAGE>

or director, officer, controlling person or underwriter may become subject,
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the
extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for
use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such
director, officer, controlling person, underwriter, or other such Holder or
director, officer, controlling person or underwriter in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5.7(b)
--------  -------
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Holder from whom indemnification is sought (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, that, in no event shall any
                                   --------
indemnity under this Section 5.7(b) exceed the gross proceeds from the offering
received by such Holder.

                    (c)  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 5.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any
governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 5.7, deliver to
the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall
                             --------  -------
have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid
by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the
counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual
or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other
party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver
written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action, shall only relieve such indemnifying party of
any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 5.7 if and to the
extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such omission, but the
omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve
it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than
under this Section 5.7. No indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim
or litigation against an indemnified party, shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party
of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation, unless
such indemnified party shall otherwise consent in writing.

                    (d)  In order to provide for just and equitable
contributions in any case in which either (i) any Holder exercising registration
rights under Sections 5.2 or 5.3 of this Agreement, or any controlling person of
any such Holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.7
but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a
court of competent jurisdiction and following the expiration of time to appeal
or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be
enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this Section 5.7 provides
for indemnification in such case, or

                                       16
<PAGE>

(ii) contribution under the Act may be required on the part of any such Holder
or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is
provided under this Section 5.7; then, and in each such case, the Company and
such Holder shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or
liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect both the relative benefit received
by such Holder and the relative fault of the Company and such Holder; provided,
                                                                      --------
however, that, in any such case, (A) no such Holder will be required to
-------
contribute any amount in excess of the net proceeds received by such selling
Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) will be entitled to
contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the relative benefit
received by such Holder shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the
public offering price of its Registrable Securities offered by the registration
statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by such
registration statement; and the relative fault of the Company and such Holder
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission of a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Holder and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.

                    (e)  The obligations of the Company and Holders under this
Section 5.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable
Securities in a registration statement filed pursuant to this Agreement, the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 hereof and otherwise.

               5.8  Reports Under the Exchange Act. With a view to making
                    ------------------------------
available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and
any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time permit a
Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration, the
Company agrees to:

                    (a)  make and keep public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times;

                    (b)  file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports
and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act; and

                    (c)  furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any
Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) a written statement by the
Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of the most recent annual or
quarterly report of the Company and such other reports and documents so filed by
the Company and (iii) such other information as may be reasonably requested in
availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the Commission which permits
the selling of any such securities without registration.

               5.9  Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the
                    ---------------------------------
Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement may be
assigned by a Holder; provided, that within a reasonable time after such
                      --------
transfer, the Company is furnished with written

                                       17
<PAGE>

notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities
with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned; and provided,
                                                                       --------
further, that such assignment shall be effective only if immediately following
-------
such transfer the further disposition of such securities by the transferee or
assignee is restricted under the Securities Act. Any assignee or transferee
asserting rights under this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to the
terms and conditions hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holders' rights to
cause the Company to register their Registrable Securities and to keep
information available, granted to them by the Company under this Section 5, may
be assigned (or assigned in part and retained in part) to one or more
transferees or assignees who either (x) are Affiliates of Stockholder or (y)
receive Registrable Securities which, upon full exercise and conversion,
represent the right to obtain at least five hundred thousand (500,000) shares of
Registrable Securities (as adjusted for stock dividends, stock split,
recapitalizations and the like that occur after the date of this Agreement),
provided, that (i) the Company is given written notice by such Holder at the
--------
time of or within a reasonable time after said transfer or assignment, stating
the name and address of said transferee or assignee and identifying the
securities with respect to which such rights are being assigned, and (ii) upon
request by the Company, such permitted transferee or assignee executes a
counterpart to Section 5 of this Agreement.

          5.10 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement. Each Holder hereby agrees that it
                ---------------------------
shall not, to the extent requested by the Company and an underwriter of Common
Stock (or other securities) of the Company, sell, make short sale of, loan,
grant any option for the purchase of or otherwise transfer or dispose (other
than to donees who agree to be similarly bound) of any Registrable Securities
for a period of time, as agreed to by the Company and the underwriter not to
exceed ninety (90) days, following the effective date of a registration
statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act for an offering in which
the Holder participates; provided, however, that all officers and directors of
                         --------  -------
the Company and all other persons with registration rights (whether or not
pursuant to this Agreement) except passive, outside investors enter into similar
agreements.

          5.11 Termination of Registration Rights. The Company's obligations
               ----------------------------------
pursuant to this Section 5 shall terminate as to any Holder of Registrable
Securities when the Holder can sell all of such Holder's Registrable Securities
pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act and shall be suspended, but not
terminated, during any three-month period in which such Holder is entitled to
sell all shares issued or issuable to such Holder under Rule 144. This Section 5
shall expressly survive termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7
hereto.

          5.12 No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company shall not, on or after
               --------------------------
the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement with respect to its
securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Stockholder and
other Holders in this Section 5 or otherwise conflicts with the provisions of
this Section 5. The Company represents and warrants to Stockholder that the
rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any way conflict with and are
not inconsistent with any registration rights granted to any holders of the
Company's securities.

          5.13 Limitations on Subsequent Registration Rights. From and after the
               ---------------------------------------------
date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Stockholder, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder
of any securities of the Company

                                       18
<PAGE>

giving such holder or prospective holder any registration rights, other than
registration rights which are no more favorable (in terms of rights and
limitations) than those granted to Stockholder hereunder and under which the
rights of such third party holder or prospective holder to include securities in
such registration are subordinate to the right of Holders to include Registrable
Securities therein; provided however that the Company may grant registration
rights which are equivalent in priority to the registration rights granted
hereunder to recipients of Voting Stock issued by the Company in connection with
a transaction of the type described in Rule 145(a) under the Securities Act or a
share exchange in which the Company is the acquiring corporation.

     6.   Notice of Voting Stock Transfers by Mattson.

               -------
business days prior to any sale or transfer of, or entering into any agreement

Stockholder), Mattson shall provide Stockholder written notice stating: (i) the
number of shares of Voting Stock to be sold or transferred; (ii) the name,
address and relationship to Mattson, if any, of the purchaser or transferee; and

sales or transfers of Voting Stock by Mattson:

               (a)  any transfer to Mattson's spouse, lineal descendant or
antecedent, father, mother, brother or sister, the adopted child or adopted
grandchild of Mattson, or the spouse of any child, adopted child, grandchild or
adopted grandchild of Mattson, or to a trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit
of Mattson or his family members as described in this Section 6.2(a), transfers
from Mattson by devise or descent, or transfers by way of any pledge by Mattson;

               (b)  any transfer pursuant to a bona fide loan transaction that
creates a mere security interest; or

               (c)  sales or transfers not exceeding 100,000 shares in any
single transaction or series of related transactions, or 200,000 shares in the
aggregate in any twelve (12) month period.

     7.   Effectiveness; Termination.
          --------------------------

          7.1  Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become effective upon the
               -------------
Closing of the STEAG Transaction as contemplated by the Combination Agreement
(the "Effective Date") and prior thereto shall be of no force or effect. If the
Combination Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with its terms, this
Agreement shall automatically be deemed to have been terminated and shall
thereafter be of no force or effect.

          7.2  Termination. Except with respect to the rights and obligations
               -----------
set forth in Section 5 which by their terms expressly survive until terminated
pursuant to Section 5.11 and

                                       19
<PAGE>

the general provision set forth in Section 8, all rights, remedies, obligations
and liabilities of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate upon the
earliest to occur of:

               (a)  Stockholder's beneficial ownership of Voting Stock
constituting less than twenty percent (20%) of the then-outstanding Voting
Stock;

               (b)  Stockholder's beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or
more of the then-outstanding Voting Stock other than as a result of
Stockholder's violation of Section 2 of this Agreement; or

               (c)  a material breach by the Company of any of its material
obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a good faith
disagreement with respect to the Company's indemnification obligations under
Section 5.7, or the failure by the Company to timely satisfy a notice or filing
obligation under Sections 2.6, 3.1, 5.3, 5.4(a) or 5.8, if such notice or filing
is ultimately made by the Company not more than thirty (30) days after the date
prescribed therefor, shall not result in termination of the parties' rights,
remedies, obligations and liabilities under this Section 7.2(c); provided, that
nothing contained in this Section 7.2(c) shall limit any rights Stockholder may
have to damages or other remedies, whether at law or in equity, as a result of
any of the breaches described in this Section 7.2(c).

     8.   Miscellaneous.
          -------------

               ---------------------------
agreements or understandings written or oral between the parties hereto,
relating to the subject matter hereof, and incorporates the entire understanding
of the parties with respect thereto.

          8.2  Amendment or Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended
               ---------------------------------
or supplemented only by a written instrument signed by the party against whom
the amendment or supplement is sought to be enforced. The party benefited by any
condition or obligation may waive the same, but such waiver shall not be
enforceable by another party unless made by written instrument signed by the
waiving party. Any waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement on one occasion shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of
any breach of any other provision of this Agreement. The failure of a party to
insist upon strict compliance with any term of this Agreement on one or more
occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right
thereafter to insist upon strict compliance with that term or any other term of
this Agreement.

          8.3  Notices. Any notice or other communication under or relating to
               -------
this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given

     1.2   Annual Meeting. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election
           --------------
of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be
brought before the meeting shall be held on a date to be fixed by the Board of
Directors or the Chief Executive Officer at the time and place to be fixed by
the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer and stated in the notice
of the meeting. If no annual meeting is held in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, the Board of Directors shall cause the meeting to be held as soon
thereafter as convenient.

     1.3   Special Meetings. Special meetings of Stockholders may be called at
           ----------------
any time only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief

     1.4   Notice of Meetings. Written notice of each meeting of stockholders,
           ------------------
whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date on which the meeting is to be held, to each
stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise provided
herein or as required by law (meaning here and hereafter, as required from time
to time by the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Certificate of
Incorporation). The notices of all meetings shall state the place, date and hour
of the meeting. The notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the
purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. If mailed, notice is given
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the

           -----------
Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before each meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the

stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten (10) days prior to the meeting, at a place within the city where the meeting
is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or
if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time of the meeting, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by
each of them.

                                       1
<PAGE>

     1.6   Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by law or these Bylaws, the
           ------
holders of a majority of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum shall
fail to attend any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a
majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or
by proxy, may adjourn the meeting to another place, date or time.

     If a notice of any adjourned special meeting of stockholders is sent to all
stockholders entitled to vote thereat, stating that it will be held with those
present constituting a quorum, then except as otherwise required by law, those
present at such adjourned meeting shall constitute a quorum, and all matters
shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting.

     1.7   Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any
           ------------
other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held
under these Bylaws by the holders of a majority of the shares of stock present
or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum,
or, if no stockholder is present, by any officer entitled to preside at or to
act as Secretary of such meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another place,
date or time, written notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned
meeting is more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the meeting was
originally noticed, or if a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
written notice of the place, date, and time of the adjourned meeting shall be
given in conformity herewith. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may
transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

     1.8   Voting and Proxies. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each
           ------------------
share of stock entitled to vote held of record by such stockholder and a
proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise provided
by law. Each stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders, may vote in person or may authorize any other person or persons to
vote or act for him by written proxy executed by the stockholder or his
authorized agent or by a transmission permitted by law and delivered to the
Secretary of the Corporation. No stockholder may authorize more than one proxy
for his shares. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable
reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section may
be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any
and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile transmission or other reproduction shall be a
complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

     1.9   Action at Meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, any
           -----------------
election shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders entitled to vote at the election, and all other matters shall be
determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on the
matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as
separate classes, then in the case of each such class, a majority of each such
class present or represented and voting affirmatively or negatively on the
matter) shall decide such matter, except when a different vote is required by
express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws;
provided, however, that if the Board of Directors by resolution determines that
--------  -------
the vote

                                       2
<PAGE>

of a larger portion of the Corporation's stock is required to approve any
particular matter in order to satisfy or comply with applicable governmental or
regulatory requirements, such as NASDAQ corporate governance rules or Internal
Revenue Service stockholder approval guidelines, then such higher vote shall be
deemed required by these Bylaws.

     All voting, including on the election of directors, but excepting where
otherwise required by law, may be by a voice vote; provided, however, that upon
demand therefor by a stockholder entitled to vote or his or her proxy, a stock
vote shall be taken. Every stock vote shall be taken by ballots, each of which
shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other
information as may be required under the procedure established for the meeting.
Every vote taken by ballots shall be counted by an inspector or inspectors
appointed by the chairman of the meeting. The Corporation may, and to the extent
required by law, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one
or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The
Corporation may designate one or more persons as an alternate inspector to
replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to
act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting may, and
to the extent required by law, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at
the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.

     1.10  Notice of Stockholder Business. At an annual meeting of the
           ------------------------------
stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly
brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting,
business must be (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) properly
brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or
(iii) properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder. For business
to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of
the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder proposal to be presented at an
annual meeting shall be received at the Corporation's principal executive
offices not less than 120 calendar days in advance of the date that the
Corporation's (or the Corporation's predecessor's) proxy statement was released
to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of
stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was held in the previous year or
the date of the annual meeting has been advanced by more than 30 calendar days
from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement,
notice by the stockholders to be timely must be received not later than the
close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the date of the
annual meeting is publicly announced.

     A stockholder's notice to the Secretary of the Corporation shall set forth
as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting
(i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual
meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation's books,
of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares
of the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business.

     1.11  Conduct of Business. At every meeting of the stockholders, the
           -------------------

<PAGE>

appointed by the Board of Directors, shall act as Chairman. The Secretary of the
Corporation or a person designated by the Chairman of the meeting shall act as
Secretary of the meeting. Unless otherwise approved by the Chairman of the
meeting, attendance at the stockholders' meeting is restricted to stockholders
of record, persons authorized in accordance with Section 1.8 of these Bylaws to
act by proxy, and officers of the Corporation.

     The Chairman of the meeting shall call the meeting to order, establish the
agenda, and conduct the business of the meeting in accordance therewith or, at
the Chairman's discretion, it may be conducted otherwise in accordance with the
wishes of the stockholders in attendance. The date and time of the opening and
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
the meeting shall be announced at the meeting.

     The Chairman shall also conduct the meeting in an orderly manner, rule on
the precedence of, and procedure on, motions and other procedural matters, and
exercise discretion with respect to such procedural matters with fairness and
good faith toward all those entitled to take part. The Chairman may impose

meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not
be transacted.

Corporation, with such lawfully delegated powers and duties as it therefor
confers, to serve at the pleasure of the Board. The Board may designate one or
more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members of the
committee present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or
not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of
the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or

Board of Directors.

subsidiary corporations in any other capacity and receiving compensation for
such service.

           -------------------------------------------------------

           (a) There is hereby established a nominating committee to evaluate

     exclusively by the Nominating Committee, subject to (i) Section 2.15(c) and
     (ii) the rights of stockholders pursuant to Section 2.15(d). For a period
     of three (3) years following the effective date of the Stockholder
     Agreement, if at any time there is a vacant directorship other than a
     directorship previously held by a STEAG Representative, the Nominating
     Committee shall nominate to fill such vacancy only those persons who
     receive the unanimous approval of the members of the Nominating Committee.
     Until the termination of the Stockholder Agreement, the Nominating
     Committee shall nominate only such nominees as would, if

                                       7
<PAGE>

     elected, result in the following composition of the Board of Directors: (i)
     two (2) STEAG Representatives, (ii) the Chief Executive Officer of the
     Corporation, and (iii) at least three (3) incumbent directors of the

     nominee within four (4) months after a directorship becomes vacant, the
     Board of Directors may act to elect and appoint a nominee to fill such
     vacancy; provided that the election and appointment of such nominee is
     consistent with maintaining the composition of the Board of Directors
     described in the last sentence of Section 2.15(b).

          (d)  Any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors
     generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a
     meeting only if timely notice of such stockholder's intent to make such
     nomination or nominations has been given in writing to the Secretary of the
     Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder nomination for a director to be
     elected at an annual meeting must be received at the Corporation's
     principal executive offices not less than 120 calendar days in advance of
     the date that the Corporation's (or the Corporation's predecessor's) proxy
     statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous
     year's annual meeting of stockholders, except that if no annual meeting was
     held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been
     changed by more than 30 calendar days from the date contemplated at the
     time of the previous year's proxy statement, or in the event of a
     nomination for director to be elected at a special meeting, notice by the
     stockholders to be timely must be received not later than the close of
     business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the
     date of the special meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.
     Each such notice shall set forth: (a) the name and address of the
     stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons
     to be nominated; (b) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of
     record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of
     directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by
     proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the
     notice; (c) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the
     stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such
     person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to
     be made by the stockholder; (d) such other information regarding each
     nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in
     a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and
     Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be
     nominated, by the Board of Directors; and (e) the consent of each nominee
     to serve as a director of the Corporation if so elected.

          (e)  For purposes of these Bylaws, the term "STEAG Representative"
     means a person designated by STEAG in accordance with Section 1.1(a) of the
     Stockholder Agreement for election or appointment as a director of the
     Corporation. For purposes of these Bylaws, the term "Independent Director"
     means any person who has not and has never been an officer, employee or
     paid consultant of the Corporation, STEAG or any of their respective
     Affiliates (as defined in the Stockholder Agreement). For purposes of

                                       8

     these Bylaws, the term "STEAG" means STEAG Electronic Systems AG, or its
     successors and permitted assigns in accordance with the Stockholder
     Agreement.

          (f)  In the event that a person is validly designated as a nominee in
     accordance with this Section 2.15 and shall thereafter become unable or
     unwilling to stand for election to the Board of Directors, any proposed
     substitute nominee must be approved for nomination in accordance with the
     foregoing provisions of this Section 2.15.

          (g)  If the Chairman of a stockholder meeting at which a vote is to be
     taken for the election of directors determines that a nomination of any
     candidate for election as a director at such meeting was not made in
     accordance with the applicable provisions of this Section 2.15, such
     nomination shall be void.

                                       14
<PAGE>

the Board of Directors, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, such amendment may

           -------------------

of such special meeting.

Article 7. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
           -----------------------------------------

     7.1   Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party or
           ------------------------
is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
("proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or
she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director
or officer of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity while serving as a
director, officer or employee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware Law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said Law permitted the Corporation to provide prior
to such amendment) against all expenses, liability and loss reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or
employee and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 7.2 of
                --------
this Article 7, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if (a) such indemnification is expressly required
to be made by law, (b) the action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (c) such
indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant
to the powers vested in the Corporation under the Delaware General Corporation
Law, or (d) the action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) is brought to
establish or enforce a right to indemnification under an indemnity agreement or
any other statute or law or otherwise as required under Section 145 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law.  Such right shall be a contract right and
shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
                                                                   --------
however that, unless the Delaware General Corporation Law then so prohibits, the
-------
payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in
his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is tendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation. service to an employee benefit plan) in advance
of the final disposition of such proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to
the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer,
to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined

                                       15
<PAGE>

ultimately that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Section or otherwise.

     7.2   Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 7.1 is not
           -------------------------------
paid in full by the Corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim
has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim
and, if such suit is not frivolous or brought in bad faith, the claimant shall
be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other then an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any, has been tendered to this
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct,
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not
met the applicable standard of conduct.

     7.3   Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may, to the
           ---------------------------------------
extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to
indemnification, and to the advancement of related expenses, to any employee or
agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article
with respect to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors
and officers of the Corporation.

     7.4   Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person in
           -------------------------
Sections 7.1 and 7.2 shall not be exclusive of any other right which such
persons may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

     7.5   Indemnification Contracts. The Board of Directors is authorized to
           -------------------------
enter into a contract with any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing
for indemnification rights equivalent to or, if the Board of Directors so
determines, greater than, those provided for in this Article 7.

     7.6   Insurance. The Corporation shall maintain insurance to the extent
           ---------
reasonably available, at its expense, to protect itself and any such director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Delaware
General Corporation Law.

                                       16
<PAGE>

     7.7   Effect of Amendment. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any
           -------------------
provision of this Article 7 by the stockholders and the directors of the
Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or
officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or
modification.
