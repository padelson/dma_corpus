2012, among The Warnaco Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_

Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ ").

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board, the Parent Board and the Board of Directors of
Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, determined that the terms of this
Agreement are in the best interests of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, and their respective stockholders, and declared the advisability
of this Agreement;

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have
recommended adoption and approval of this Agreement by their respective
stockholders; and

  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain

hereto agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I _ 

The Merger_

  

SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall
be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective
Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Company_ ").

to be specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the
fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Marketing Period has not ended
at such time, the Closing shall occur instead on (a) the earlier to occur of
(i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period to be specified by Parent to
the Company on no less than three Business Days\' written notice and (ii) the
last day of the Marketing Period (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the
first Business Day occurring thereafter); or (b) such other date    and
time as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

  

        

  



     

  

  

 SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

SECTION 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

  

SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to
the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the
Surviving Company.

  

SECTION 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  

ARTICLE II _ 

Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

  



  

SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "):

  

 (i) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all 

  

  

2

        

  


purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence.  

  

(ii) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock;
Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned Stock_. 

  

(A) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the
Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

(B) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of
Merger Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Company such that the ownership percentage of any such
Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time
shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections
2.02 and 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or
converted into shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with Section
2.01(ii) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive
(x) .1822 shares of common stock, par value $1 per share, of Parent (the "
_Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (y) $51.75 in
cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders become
entitled upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.02, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding    shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as the case may be, will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event. As provided in Section 2.02(j), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any required withholding under applicable Tax Law.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agen_ t")
for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Consideration (or appropriate
alternative arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of
Parent Common Stock will be issued) and (ii) cash sufficient to (x) pay the
Cash Consideration and (y) make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.02(f). All such Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

  

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within four Business
Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each holder of record of Company Common Stock a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent,
shall be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to
shares held in book-entry form) as Parent may specify subject to the
Company\'s reasonable approval, and shall be prepared prior to the Closing),
together with instructions thereto.

  

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with
Exchange_. Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by a Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent,
in each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the Merger
Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (y) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f)
and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is notregistered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d)) may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock (or, if
such Company Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such
transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and
any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock are entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to
Section 2.01(iii) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions pursuant

  

  

4

     to Section 2.02(d)). No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company Common
Stock held in book-entry form).  

  

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment with respect to the Cash Consideration
or in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until the
surrender of such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or
other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form), there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, (A) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and (B) the amount of dividends or other distributions declared on the
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and
a payment date prior to such surrender that is payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the
terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock
(including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) shall be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported in _The
Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative
source mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on the last complete
trading day prior to the date of the Effective Time.

  

        

  

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common
Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II, in each case without any
interest thereon.

  

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for two years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash in the Exchange Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to,
and be the property of, Parent. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any stockholder
of the Company to receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as
provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such
investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reason below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to
be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments.

  

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Exchange
Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

  

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, issue the
Stock Consideration and pay the Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on such Certificate, in
each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  

SECTION 2.03 _Dissenters\' Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding as of the

  

  

6

        

  

  

Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised
such stockholder\'s appraisal rights in respect of such shares (any such
shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") under Section 262
of the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(iii) and instead shall be entitled
to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until
such stockholder shall have failed to timely perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder\'s right to dissent from the
Merger under the DGCL, in which case such stockholder shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
that the stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and
in respect of any dividends or other distributions that the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d)) in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be deemed to be Dissenting Shares) and to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The Company (i) shall give Parent
prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock or any withdrawals of such demands received by the
Company, (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands and (iii)
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate,
any such demands.

Company that the statements contained in this Article III are true and correct
except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents filed and publicly available
after December 31, 2011 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed
Parent SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed Parent SEC
Documents that are set forth under the headings "Risk Factors" or disclosure
of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly cautionary, nonspecific or predictive in nature;
it being understood that any factual information contained within such
headings, disclosure or statements shall not be excluded) or in the disclosure

delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure
Letter"). The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and
lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in this Article III, and the disclosure in any section shall not be
deemed to qualify any other section in this Article III except to the extent

section.

  

SECTION 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and each of
Parent\'s Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of Parent
Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), where the failure to be so organized,
exist or be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse

  

  

7

authority or to possess Parent Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so

dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests),
except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws.

  

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and

documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be furnished or filed by Parent with the SEC since February 1,
2010 (such documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC during
such period by Parent on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form 8-K,
but excluding the Form S-4, being collectively referred to as the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ ").

  

  

11

that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the
principal financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive
officer of Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as

15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to
the Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and accurate as of the date of such certifications. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _principal executive officer_ " and " _principal financial
officer_ " shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. None of Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  

(e) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with the
authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection

 (f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the management of Parent, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

  

(g) Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance

against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental
Entity involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

SECTION 3.10 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws and Parent Permits, including all applicable rules, regulations,
directives or policies of any Governmental Entity, in each case that are
material to the operations of each of Parent's business segments (as described
in the Filed Parent SEC Documents). To Parent\'s Knowledge, no material
action, demand or investigation by or before any Governmental Entity is
pending or threatened alleging that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is not in
compliance with any applicable Law or Parent Permit or which challenges or
questions the validity of any rights of the holder of any Parent Permit, in
each case that are material to the operations of each of Parent's business
segments (as described in the Filed Parent SEC Documents).

  

SECTION 3.11 _Brokers\' Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Peter J. Solomon Company L.P.,

SECTION 3.12 _Financing_. 

  

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in
Article IV and compliance by the Company with its agreements hereunder, in
each case, in all material respects, as of the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub will have available to them all funds necessary to consummate the
Merger and to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration, all other cash amounts
required to be paid in connection with the Merger and all fees and expenses
required to be paid in connection with the Financing.

  

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete fully-executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of October
29, 2012, by and among Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
(collectively, together with their Affiliates and their successors

  

  

14

        

  

  



  

and permitted assignees, the " _Lenders_ ") and Parent, including all
exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter, in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, together with a redacted copy of any fee letter
relating thereto (together, the " _Commitment Letter_ "). Pursuant to the
Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, each of
the parties thereto (other than Parent) have severally agreed and committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth
therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such Commitment
Letter (including the making of loans to Parent and/or Merger Sub to finance
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement). As of
the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect,
has not been withdrawn, terminated, rescinded, amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified in any respect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto.

  

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, other than the Commitment
Letter, there are no other Contracts pursuant to which a third party has
agreed and committed funds in connection with the Financing or relating to any
terms or conditions thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, nor, to Parent\'s
Knowledge, any other party thereto, under any term or condition of the
Commitment Letter, (ii) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent or other contingency set forth in the Commitment Letter,
or (iii) to Parent's Knowledge, otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing being unavailable on or before the Closing Date. As of the date
hereof, there are no conditions relating to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the
date hereof, and assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in
Article IV and compliance by the Company with its agreements hereunder, in
each case, in all material respects, Parent has no reason to believe any of
the conditions relating to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
will not be satisfied on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to
be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay
any such fees as they become due.

  

SECTION 3.13 _Merger Sub_. Parent is the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.
Since its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business
nor conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

  

SECTION 3.14 _Share Ownership_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has been, at
any time during the three years prior to the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. As of the
date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates owns any shares of capital stock of the Company or has any rights
to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company (except pursuant to this
Agreement).

  

SECTION 3.15 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article III or in any
certificate delivered by the Company to Parent or Merger Sub in accordance
with the terms hereof (and notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the
Company or its Representatives of any documentation, projections,

  

  

15

        

  

  

estimates, budgets or other information), the Company acknowledges that none
of Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of Parent
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

ARTICLE IV _ 

Representations and Warranties of the Company_

  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed and publicly available after December
31, 2011 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC
Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed Company SEC Documents
that are set forth under the headings "Risk Factors" or disclosure of risks
set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other
statements that are similarly cautionary, nonspecific or predictive in nature;
it being understood that any factual information contained within such
headings, disclosure or statements shall not be excluded) or in the disclosure
letter delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_
"). The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered
sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this
Article IV, and the disclosure in any section shall not be deemed to qualify
any other section in this Article IV except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other section.

  

SECTION 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of the Company\'s Subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries that are not Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is
defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), where the failure to be so
organized, exist or be in good standing, has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all
requisite power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it
to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to possess Company Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete
copies of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the
by-laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Company By-laws").

Section 4.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries, each such Company Subsidiary\'s jurisdiction of incorporation and the class, number and percentage of its authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, if any, that are not owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary.  

  

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and
other equity interests in, the Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or

convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation,
partnership, company, limited liability company, trust, joint venture,
association or other entity.

  

SECTION 4.03 _Capital Structure_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 112,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 20,000,000

outstanding Company Stock Options and (B) 688,223 shares were potentially
issuable upon the vesting or settlement of outstanding Company Career Units,
Company RSUs, Company Performance Shares and Company PSUs (in the case of
Company Performance Shares and Company PSUs, assuming maximum performance
targets are achieved). Except as set forth in this Section 4.03(a), at the
close of business on October 25, 2012, no shares of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company were issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. From the close of business on October 25, 2012
to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances by the Company of

the Company, other than the issuance of Company Common Stock upon the exercise
of Company Stock Options or the vesting or settlement of Company Career Units,
Company RSUs, or Company PSUs outstanding at the close of business on October

issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to, or issued in
violation of, any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision
of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or any Contract to which
the Company is a party or otherwise bound. All grants of equity awards or
other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to current or
former directors, officers, employees, agents or consultants of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary have been made in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder and any policy
of the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_
") (including any committee thereof) relating to the grant of such awards or
rights. Except as set forth above in this Section 4.03, there are not issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are not any outstanding
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, (x) any capital stock of the

Company Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares
of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (y) any warrants, calls, options or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any other
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell,

securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or other obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary that are linked in any way to the price of any class of
Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of any Company

the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions
declared or paid on any shares of capital stock of the Company or any Company

shares of capital stock or voting securities or other equity interests of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants,
calls, options or other rights referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence. With respect to Company Stock Options, (1)
each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized on the date on which
the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the "
_Grant Date_ ") for such option by all necessary corporate action, including,
as applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof), and (2) the per share exercise
price of each Company Stock Option was at least equal to the fair market value
of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date. There are no
debentures, bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote ("
_Company Voting Debt_ "). Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of

Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The

the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL). The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding

with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

SECTION 4.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_. (a) The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement does not, and the performance by it of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i)
the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary (assuming that the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained), (ii) any Contract to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective

and other matters referred to in Section 4.05(b), any Judgment or Law, in each
case, applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets (assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is

2010 (such documents, together with any documents filed with the SEC during
such period by the Company on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on Form
8-K, but excluding the Proxy Statement, being collectively referred to as the
" _Company SEC Documents_ ").

  

(b) Each Company SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in
all material respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and (ii) did
not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or
amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing
or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the
Company included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it was
filed as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, was prepared in accordance

with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

  

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the

this Agreement, (iii) for liabilities and obligations that have been incurred
in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2011 and (iv) for
liabilities and obligations that have been discharged or paid in full in the
ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and
the principal financial officer of the Company (or each former principal
executive officer of the Company and each former principal financial officer
of the Company, as applicable) has made all applicable certifications required
by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
SOX with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in

directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

  

(e) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over

Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in

involved, (ii) that transactions are executed only in accordance with the

are reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and
communicated to the management of the Company, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company to make the certifications
required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-

or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any of the
Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries in the Company\'s or such Company Subsidiary\'s
published financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

registrations and applications disclosed pursuant to Section 4.16(a)(i), and
(C) material to the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as
presently conducted under each of the Calvin Klein, Speedo, Chaps, Olga, and
Warner\'s trademarks (the businesses conducted under each such trademark,
taken as a whole, are each a " _Principal Business_ "); (iii) pending suits,
actions or other inter parties proceedings (including those in Patent and
Trademark Offices and courts) directly related to any material Intellectual
Property Rights owned by the Company, Company Subsidiaries, and the Calvin
Klein Trust; and (iv) material suits, actions or other proceedings instituted
within the six years prior to the date of this Agreement or threatened in
writing within the four years prior to the date of this Agreement (e.g., via

Rights.

  

(b) The Calvin Klein Trust, the Company or a Company Subsidiary
owns of record, beneficially owns and/or is licensed or otherwise has the
right to use all Intellectual Property Rights necessary to conduct, or
material to, any of the Principal Businesses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing representation and warranty shall not apply to infringement,
misappropriation, or unauthorized use of third-party Intellectual Property
Rights. The Calvin Klein Trust is the sole and exclusive title owner of the
Calvin Klein Marks included in the Registered Intellectual Property Rights,
and the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as disclosed in Section 4.16(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, is the owner of all other Registered
Intellectual Property Rights, in each case free and clear of all Liens other
than Sales-Related Contracts, immaterial license agreements and as disclosed
on Section 4.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and the Company, Company
Subsidiaries, and the Calvin Klein Trust have not granted any material
licenses (including rights to use and other than Sales-Related Contracts) with
respect to the Registered Intellectual Property Rights. All material
applications and registrations in the Registered Intellectual Property Rights
used by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to the Company\'s Knowledge,
are valid and in full force and effect, and have not been assigned to a third
party. All material applications and registrations for Intellectual Property
Rights licensed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary from (i) PRL USA, Inc.
(as successor to Polo Ralph Lauren, L.P. and Polo Ralph Lauren Enterprises,
L.P.) and (ii) Speedo International Limited or Speedo International B.V., are,
to the Knowledge of the

Company, valid and, with respect to applications, in force and effect, or,
with respect to registrations, in full force and effect, in each case in
jurisdictions material to the applicable Principal Business. There is no
Intellectual Property Right necessary to conduct, or material to, any of the
Principal Businesses(whether used by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Person authorized by any of the foregoing), that is not owned of record,
or beneficially owned, by the Calvin Klein Trust, the Company or a Company
Subsidiary or that the Company or a Company Subsidiary is not properly
authorized or otherwise does not have the right to use.

  

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, the operation of the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as presently conducted
does not infringe, misappropriate or make unauthorized use of, in any material
respect, any Intellectual Property Rights of third parties, and there is no
material suit, action or other proceeding pending or threatened in writing
that alleges that the use of Intellectual Property Rights by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries infringes, misappropriates or constitutes the
unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property Rights of third parties.

  

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Intellectual Property
Rights set forth in Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter are not
being infringed in any material respect by any Person, and there are no
material suits, actions or other proceedings pending, for which notice has
been provided to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein
Trust, or threatened in writing, challenging the Company\'s, any Company
Subsidiary\'s or the Calvin Klein Trust\'s ownership of or right to use, or
the validity or enforceability or patentability of, any material Intellectual
Property Rights.

  

(e) Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list, and the
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies, of: (i) each
Contract that purports to materially restrict the ability of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries or the Calvin Klein Trust to use or register any
of the material Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein Trust, except for any Sales-Related Contracts;
and (ii) all material license agreements pursuant to which (A) the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein Trust grants any Person the right
to use any Intellectual Property Rights owned by either the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein Trust, except for any Sales-Related
Contracts; or (B) any Person grants either the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or the Calvin Klein Trust the right to use any Intellectual Property Rights
(other than licenses for commercially available software or hardware that are
not material to any of the Principal Businesses or the operations thereof)
(each Contract described in clauses (i) and (ii), in each case, is referred to
herein as a " _Material Intellectual Property Contract_ "); _provided_ that
the Excluded Contracts shall not be required to be listed on Section 4.16(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, shall not be required to be made available
to Parent pursuant to this Section 4.16(e) (it being understood that such
Contracts may be required to be made available to Parent pursuant to other
Sections of this Agreement), and shall not be deemed a "Material Intellectual
Property Contract" for any purposes hereunder. None of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein Trust is in breach of or default in any
material respect, or is alleged in writing, to be in breach of or default, in
any material respect, under any Material Intellectual Property Contract, nor
has an event or condition occurred (or been alleged by any other party in
writing to have occurred) that would constitute a material breach or event of
default on the part of the Company, any Company

  

  

32

        

  

  



  

Subsidiary or the Calvin Klein Trust, or would provide a basis for a valid
claim, acceleration, additional fees or termination by any other party under
any Material Intellectual Property Contract, in each case that would be
material to a Principal Business, except with respect to any Material
Intellectual Property Contract which expires by its terms. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no other party is in breach or default, in any material
respect, under any Material Intellectual Property Contract, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, has any event or condition occurred (or been alleged
by any other party in writing to have occurred) that would constitute a
material breach or event of default on the part of such other party under any
Material Intellectual Property Contract, except with respect to any Material
Intellectual Property Contract which expires by its terms. No waiver or
deferral of enforcement of any material rights or benefits of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary has been provided in writing by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary under any Material Intellectual Property Contract since
January 1, 2012. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the material loss or impairment of any of the
Company\'s, any Company Subsidiary\'s or the Calvin Klein Trust\'s rights in
the Intellectual Property Rights of the Company.

  

(f) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries take commercially
reasonable measures to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all trade
secrets and other material confidential information that are owned by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
has a policy to secure valid written assignments or other written
confirmations from all consultants, contractors and employees who contribute
or have contributed to the creation or development of any material
Intellectual Property Right owned or purported to be owned by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary of all the rights to such contributions that the
Company or any Company Subsidiary does not already own by operation of Law.

  

SECTION 4.17 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any material cease-and-desist or
other material order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any
material written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or is a party to any material commitment letter or similar undertaking
to, or is subject to any material order or directive by, or has been ordered
to pay any material civil money penalty by, any Governmental Entity (other
than a taxing authority, which is covered by Section 4.09), other than those
of general application that apply to similarly situated providers of the same
services or their Subsidiaries (each item in this sentence, whether or not set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_ "),
nor has the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries been advised in writing
since January 31, 2010, by any Governmental Entity that it is considering
issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such Company Regulatory
Agreement.

  

SECTION 4.18 _Labor Matters_. 

  

(a) Section 4.18(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth

union agreements and foreign works council contracts to which the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or is bound or that is applicable
to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (" _Collective
Bargaining Agreement_ "). To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of
this Agreement, no labor organization or group of employees of the Company or
any Company

  

  

33

        

  

  



  

Subsidiary has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be brought or
filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
organizing activities, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material
arbitrations or material grievances, or other material labor disputes pending
or threatened against or involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary as of the
date of this Agreement, has entered into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding, whether written or oral, with any union, trade union, works
council or other employee representative body or any material number or
category of its employees which would prevent, restrict or materially impede
the consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, require advance notification with respect to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the implementation
of any layoff, redundancy, severance or similar program within its or their
respective workforces (or any part of them).

  

SECTION 4.19 _Brokers\' Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (the

the Company, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of the Company. The Company has furnished to Parent true and
complete copies of all agreements between the Company and the Company
Financial Advisor relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

SECTION 4.20 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the
oral opinion of the Company Financial Advisor, to be confirmed in writing
(with a copy provided to Parent promptly upon receipt by the Company), to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock.

  

SECTION 4.21 _Insurance_. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
maintains insurance policies which, in all material respects, are against
risks of a character and in such amounts as customary for companies of a
similar size operating in the same or similar industry. Each insurance policy
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in full force and effect and was
in full force and effect during the periods of time such insurance policy is
purported to be in effect, and neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) in breach
or default (including any such breach or default with respect to the payment
of premiums or the giving of notice) under any such policy, except in respects
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There is no material
claim by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries pending under any such
policies that has been denied or disputed by the insurer other than denials
and disputes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

SECTION 5.02 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Board Recommendation_.
(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
and shall not publicly announce any intention to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage (including by providing
information or assistance), facilitate or induce any Alternative Proposal,
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations (other than informing
Persons of the provisions set forth in this Section 5.02) regarding, or
furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person or "Group" (as such term is
defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) any nonpublic information
with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, agree to, accept,
endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, (iv) submit to a vote of its
stockholders, approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, or (v)
enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement
providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements
permitted under Section 5.02(b)). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by
any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall constitute a
breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company.

  

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a),
if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives receives an unsolicited, written Alternative Proposal by any
Person or "Group" at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting that
did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 5.02(a),
the Company and its Representatives may, prior to (but not after) obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, take the actions set forth in subsections
(A) and (B) of this Section 5.02(b) if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) has determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with
the Company\'s financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law: (A) obtain from such Person or "Group" an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with

  

  

  

  

  

42

         

  

  

respect to such Person or "Group" as the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement are with respect to Parent and, following the entry into such
confidentiality agreement, furnish information to such Person or "Group", and
(B) enter into discussions and negotiations with, such Person or "Group" with
respect to such Alternative Proposal.

  

(c) Promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following
receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Alternative
Proposal, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of the receipt of such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the
identity of the Person or "Group" making any such Alternative Proposal,
request or inquiry), and the Company shall as promptly as practicable provide
to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry, if in
writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral. The Company agrees that it shall
provide to Parent (on a substantially simultaneous basis) any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be
provided (pursuant to Section 5.02(b)) to any other Person or "Group" in
connection with any written Alternative Proposal that has not previously been
provided to Parent. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly
as practicable with notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably
necessary to keep Parent informed on a current basis in all material respects
of all communications regarding (including material amendments or proposed
material amendments to) such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, upon the occurrence of an
Intervening Event or in the event that the Company has received a Superior
Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.02(d)), the Company Board may withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or take any action, or make any
public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation (any of the foregoing being an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") (including, for the avoidance of doubt, recommending against the
Merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any Alternative Proposal) and,
if the Company has received a Superior Proposal (after taking into account the
terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.02(d)),
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) to enter into a
definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal
simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement, if the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ that the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or, in the case of a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(d), unless:

  

(i) the Company has complied in all material respects with
this Section 5.02;

  

(ii) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at
least four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such
action, which notice shall advise Parent, in the case of a Superior Proposal,
that the Company Board

  

 __

  



  

  

43

        

  

  



  


has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of such Superior
Proposal, or, in cases involving an Intervening Event, of the circumstances
giving rise to the Adverse Recommendation Change;

  

(iii) during the Notice Period, the Company has and has caused its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
judgment of the Company Board) a Superior Proposal, or in cases involving an
Intervening Event, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change (in
the judgment of the Company Board) would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

  

(iv) the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any
proposals, amendments or modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any,
that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal or, in cases involving an Intervening Event, that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change continues to be
inconsistent with the directors\' exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal,
the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with
the requirements of this Section 5.02(d) with respect to such new written
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this sentence,
references to the four Business Day period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two Business Day period.

  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company
shall direct its and their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
an Alternative Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to any Person (other than
Parent) that has, within the one year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, made or indicated an intention to make, or engaged in diligence or
substantive discussions with respect to, an Alternative Proposal and (iii) not
waive or amend any "standstill" provision or provisions of similar effect to
which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary and shall strictly enforce
any such provisions.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or the Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Company\'s
stockholders if the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 5.02(d).
For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that
describes the

  

  

44

       



  

Company\'s receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto (without including such reaffirmation) shall
not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(g) If (i) any public announcement regarding an Alternative
Proposal is made by the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the
Company\'s Representatives or by the Person making such Alternative Proposal,
(ii) within five Business Days following such public announcement, Parent
delivers to the Company in writing a request that the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation, and (iii) the Company Board does
not expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation during the period
of five Business Days following the delivery to the Company of such request,
then the Company shall be deemed to have made an Adverse Recommendation Change
at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of such period of five
Business Days.

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer
(whether or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving
the Company; (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or
indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business
or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more
of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any
Person) or Group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing
20% or more of the voting power of the Company; (iv) transaction in which any
Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the Company Common Stock or
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company; or (v) any combination of the
foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

  

(ii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event,
development, occurrence, state of facts or change that was not known or
reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability
or magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable) to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, which
event, development, occurrence, state of facts or change (including any change
in probability or magnitude of consequences) becomes known to the Company
Board prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that (A) in no
event shall any action taken by either party hereto to the extent required by
the affirmative covenants set forth in Section 6.03(c), and the consequences
of any such action, constitute an Intervening Event; (B) in no event shall any
decline in the market price or trading volume of the securities of Parent
constitute an Intervening Event

  

  

45

        


(provided that the underlying causes of any such decline may be considered in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); and (C) in no event
shall the receipt, existence of or terms of an Alternative Proposal or any
inquiry relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an Intervening
Event.

  

  

  

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written
proposal or offer made by a third party or Group pursuant to which such third
party (or, in a parent-to-parent merger involving such third party, the
stockholders of such third party) or Group would acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the Company Common Stock or assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (i) on terms which the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the
Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this
Agreement); and (ii) that is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

  

  

  

ARTICLE VI _ 

Additional Agreements_

  

  

  

SECTION 6.01 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting_. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and cause
to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of
the Company relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement") and Parent shall
prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, and Parent and the Company shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement, and the Form S-4
and Proxy Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such
other party to be included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Proxy
Statement and shall provide the other with copies of all correspondence
between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other
hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each
of the Company and Parent (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version
of such document or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments
reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such

  

  

  

  

46

        

  

  



  

document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of the other,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Each of the Company and Parent shall advise the other, promptly after receipt
of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance
of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of
the Stock Consideration for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of
the Company and Parent shall also take any other action (other than qualifying
to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified)
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws, and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger and the issuance of the
Stock Consideration.

  

(b) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect
to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company of such event, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, as required by Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company\'s
stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the obligations of
any party under Section 6.01(a).

  

(c) If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, as required by Law,
in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
the Company\'s stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(c) shall limit the
obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

  

(d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the sole purpose of seeking the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company\'s
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and to hold the Company Stockholders
Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 becomes effective and (ii)
subject to Section 5.02(d), solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its stockholders that
they give the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Recommendation_ ")
and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, in each case,
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.02(d). Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 6.01(d), if on a date for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is

  

  



  

  

47

        

  

  



  

  

present, the Company may (and shall, at the request of Parent) make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned to a date that is more than 20 days after the date for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any
adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company agrees
that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior
thereto, its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to
this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative Proposal
or by the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if the public announcement of an Adverse
Recommendation Change or the delivery of notice by the Company to Parent
pursuant to Section 5.02(d)(ii) occurs less than ten Business Days prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall be entitled to postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting to a date not more than ten Business Days
after the later of such event; and (y) the Company shall not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Alternative Proposal.

  



  

SECTION 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to
Parent and to the Representatives of Parent reasonable access, upon reasonable
advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel (including in
order to allow Parent to evaluate such personnel) and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
furnish promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities
laws or commission actions and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request (in each
case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the
normal business operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary);
_provided_ , however, that the Company shall not be required to permit such
access or make such disclosure, to the extent it determines, after
consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure or access would
reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement
or other Contract with a third party (provided that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure), (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner
that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), or (iii) violate
any Law (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate
Law). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the proviso to
the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general
nature of what is being withheld. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any
access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the
extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation
where the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties. All information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of September 11, 2012, between Parent and
the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Subject to the limitations
and restrictions set forth in, and without expanding the obligations of the
Parties under, this Section 6.02, the Company shall, and shall

  

  

48

        

  

  



  

cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its
Subsidiaries to facilitate the planning of the integration of the parties and
their respective businesses after the Closing Date.

  

SECTION 6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) preparing as promptly as practicable all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and
other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all Consents
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the
" _Governmental Approvals_ ") and (ii) as promptly as practicable taking all
steps as may be necessary to obtain all such Governmental Approvals. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees
to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby within ten Business Days of the date of this Agreement, (B) make all
other required filings pursuant to other Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and (C) not extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC
or the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other party hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent and the Company shall supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law as soon as possible.

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
actions referenced in Section 6.03(a) to obtain all Governmental Approvals for
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Laws (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any communication, filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) keep the other party and/or its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other U.S. or other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with the
FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental Entity or other
person, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) permit the other party
and/or its counsel to review in advance any submission, filing or
communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by it
to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity; _provided_ that
materials may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent and the Company may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be

  

  

49

        

  

  



  

  

provided to the other under this Section 6.03(b) as "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal
counsel.

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of
the parties contained in Sections 6.03(a) and 6.03(b), Parent and the Company

including defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any
court with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party;

divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, and (y) otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing would limit
Parent\'s and/or its Subsidiaries\' (including the Company\'s and the Company
Subsidiaries\') freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
operate and/or retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets
of Parent, the Company and/or their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any action contemplated by clauses (x) and (y) is conditioned
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent to take any
actions specified in this Section 6.03(c) that would reasonably be expected in
the aggregate to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, its Subsidiaries,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

(d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and
Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence,
or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur has

and such written notice shall specify the condition which has failed or will
fail to be satisfied, (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) any written notice from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.03(d) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to Parent or the Company.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement,
during the term of this Agreement neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall cooperate with any
other Person in seeking regulatory clearance of any Alternative Proposal.

  

SECTION 6.04 _Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_. 

  

  

50

        

  

  

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Effective as of the Effective
Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested,
shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by Parent and converted into an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedules and post-employment exercise periods) as were applicable to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (2) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, at a per share exercise price equal
to the quotient of (x) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ (y) the Stock

collectively, the " _Assumed Parent Stock Options_ "). 

  

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by
Parent and converted into an award of or relating to shares of Parent Common
Stock that is otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions (including
vesting schedules) as were applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Assumed Parent
Restricted Stock Awards_ "). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock in
respect of each such Assumed Parent Restricted Stock Award shall be equal to
(1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied

(c) _Company Performance Shares and Company PSUs_. As of the
Effective Time, (1) each Company Performance Share and Company PSU granted
under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and with respect to which the applicable performance period had

vested at the target level and the holder of each such Company Performance
Share or Company PSU shall be entitled to receive, promptly following the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in respect of the target number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto, less applicable tax
withholding, and (2) if any award of Company Performance Shares or Company
PSUs with respect to which the applicable period had been completed as of the
Effective Time remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the holder of each such Company Performance Share or Company PSU shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock determined to be earned for such performance
period in respect of such award (as set forth in Section 5.01(b)(iv) of the
Company Disclosure Letter), less applicable tax withholding.

  

(d) _Company Actions_. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Plans will be terminated in accordance with their respective terms and no
further equity awards or other rights with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock will be granted thereunder. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will adopt such resolutions as may reasonably be required in its discretion to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 6.04.

  

  

  

51

Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC an effective registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to Assumed Parent Stock Options and Assumed Parent
Restricted Stock Awards (unless such shares of Parent Common Stock are
otherwise covered by such an outstanding registration statement), and Parent
shall exercise reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for so long as such Assumed Parent Stock Options
and Assumed Parent Restricted Stock Awards remain outstanding.

  

SECTION 6.05 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_. (a) Parent agrees
that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar agreements
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is
as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who
is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the
Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another Person (the "Company
Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that
the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within ten Business Days
of receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the
Surviving Company\'s certificate of incorporation or by-laws, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person
is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Company shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.05.

  



  

  

52

        

  

  



  

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or
provide substitute policies for the Company and its current and former
directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\' and
officers\' and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having
other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance
carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to
pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if
the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 6.05 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the
years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such
insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option (following
reasonable consultation with Parent), purchase a "tail" directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors\' and officers\' and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no
event shall the cost of any such tail policy in respect of any one policy year
exceed the Maximum Amount. In the event the Company purchases such tail
coverage, the Surviving Company shall cease to have any obligations under the
first sentence of this Section 6.05(c). The Surviving Company shall maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

  

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee
the prompt payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company and the Company
Subsidiaries under this Section 6.05.

  

SECTION 6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Without

  

  

53

        

  

  



  

limiting in any way the parties\' obligations under Section 6.03, the Company
shall cooperate, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to cooperate, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its directors, officers and other
Representatives to cooperate in the defense against such litigation.

  

SECTION 6.07 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub each shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause (a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
exempt under Rule 16b­3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (b) any
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each individual who may become
or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

SECTION 6.08 _Financing_. 

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Financing (or in the event any portion or all of the
Financing becomes unavailable, alternative debt financing (in an amount
sufficient, together with the remaining Financing, if any, and any other
sources available to Parent and Merger Sub, to fund the payment of the Cash
Consideration) from the same or other sources (such portion from sources other
than any source providing the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
as of the date hereof, the " _Alternate Financing_ ")) required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this agreement and to pay the related fees
and expenses on the Closing Date. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon
becoming aware of, or receiving notice or other communication with respect to,
any material breach of or default under, or any event or circumstance that
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any material breach of or default under, the Commitment Letter
by a party thereto or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of the
Commitment Letter. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that
neither the availability nor terms of the Financing or any Alternate Financing
are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger, and each of Parent and Merger Sub reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement subject only to the express conditions set forth in Article VII,
irrespective and independent of the availability or terms of the Financing or
any Alternate Financing, Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s use of efforts in
accordance with this Section 6.08, or otherwise.

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and employees to provide, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide, on a timely basis, all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent and customary in connection

  



  

  

54

        

  



  

  

  

with the arrangement of the Financing, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) facilitate the execution and delivery of definitive financing,
pledge, security and guarantee documents (which documents shall only be
required to become effective as of the Closing Date) and the provision of
guarantees and security and the performance of the other obligations
thereunder; (ii) promptly provide financial and other information regarding
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in
writing by Parent (x) in order to consummate the Financing or (y) as necessary

audited consolidated financial statements of the Company consisting of balance
sheets as of the last date of each of the two fiscal years of the Company

beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year ended at least 90 days
before the Closing Date to the last day of the most recently completed fiscal
quarter ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date (all of which shall
have been reviewed by the independent accountants for the Company (as
applicable) as provided in the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100), in
each case other than with respect to any quarter-end that is also a fiscal
year-end, and (3) all financial information about the Company requested in
writing required in order to prepare (I) a pro forma consolidated statement of
income of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the most recently completed fiscal
year ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date, (II) (X) a pro forma
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the last day
of the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended at least 45 days before
the Closing Date and (Y) a pro forma consolidated statement of income of
Parent and its Subsidiaries for the period from the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year ended at least 90 days before the Closing Date
to the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended at least
45 days before the Closing Date, together with, in the case of this clause
(Y), a corresponding statement for the corresponding period of the prior year
and (III) a pro forma consolidated income statement for the twelve-month
period ended on the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter
ended at least 45 days before the Closing Date, or, if the most recently
completed fiscal period is the end of a fiscal year, ended at least 90 days
before the Closing Date, in each case prepared after giving effect to the
transactions described herein as if they had occurred as of such date (in the
case of eac­h such balance sheet) or at the beginning of such period (in the
case of each such statement of income) and, in each case contemplated by
clauses (1) and (2), meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X (subject to
exceptions customary for a Rule 144A offering) and (B) to the extent not

issuers similar to Parent which contains all financial statements and other
financial data to be included therein (including all audited financial
statements, all unaudited financial statements (which shall have been reviewed

and prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, as if the Notes were registered, unless otherwise agreed,
but subject to exceptions customary for a Rule 144A offering), and all other
data requested in writing (including selected financial data) that the
Securities and Exchange Commission would require in a registered offering of
the Notes (subject to exceptions customary for a Rule 144A offering), and that
would be necessary in order to receive customary "comfort" (including
"negative assurance" comfort) from independent accountants of Parent and the
Company in connection with the offering of the Notes (and the Company shall

such information specified in clause (A) or clause (B), the " _Required

facilities rating; (viii) provide customary authorization letters to the

not include material non-public information about the Company or its
Affiliates or its or their securities; and (ix) assist Parent and its
financing sources in the preparation of all offering documents, an offering
memorandum and other marketing and rating agency materials for the Financing.
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon any offering memoranda or similar documents, or any materials
for rating agencies, that include information about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prepared in connection with the Financing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be required to (A) pay any commitment or other
similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation of any kind, including
under any guarantee or pledge or any other document relating to the Financing,
in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing Date, (B) enter into any
binding agreement or commitment, or adopt any resolution or otherwise take any
corporate or similar action, in connection with the Financing (or any
Alternate Financing) that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing
Date, or (C) take any action that would reasonably be expected to (1)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (2) cause any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement to be breached or any condition set forth in Article VII to fail to
be satisfied except where Parent expressly waives such breach or non-
compliance, (3) cause any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability, (4) result in the

Company Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.08 and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
directors and other Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the Financing and any information used in connection therewith
(except with respect to fraud or any intentional misrepresentation with
respect to any information provided by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries), and any action taken by any of them at the request of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.08(b).

  

(c) For purposes of this Section 6.08, the term "Financing"
shall also be deemed to include any alternative arrangement arranged by Parent
in lieu of the financing contemplated by the "Commitment Letter".

  

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding either party obtained by the other party pursuant to this Section
6.08 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Representatives shall
be permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with
customary practices in connection with the Financing subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

  

(e) With respect to any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries identified by Parent in writing at least 15
Business Days prior to the Closing Date to be repaid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, (i) the Company shall, or shall have caused the
Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices

respect of such Indebtedness and release of any Liens and guarantees in
connection therewith on the Closing Date and (ii) no later than one (1)

reasonably satisfactory to Parent from all financial institutions and other
Persons to which such Indebtedness is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee
or other representative on behalf of such Persons, which Payoff Letters shall
(x) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all
principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or other
outstanding and unpaid obligations related to such Indebtedness as of the
Closing Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and (y) state that all obligations
(including guarantees) in respect thereof and Liens in connection therewith on
the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise on the
Business shall be, substantially concurrently with the receipt of the Payoff
Amount on the Closing Date by the Persons holding such Indebtedness, released
or arrangements reasonably satisfactory to Parent for such release shall have

or similar Indebtedness.

  

SECTION 6.09 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative

57

       



  

opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent
agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this Section 6.09 shall limit the
ability of any party hereto to make internal announcements to their respective
employees that are consistent in all material respects with the prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

  

  

  

SECTION 6.10 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best

SECTION 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

  

  

  

(a) From the Effective Time through the last day of Parent's
2013 fiscal year, each employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary who
remains in the employment of Parent or a Parent Subsidiary following the
Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall receive a base salary no
lower than the base salary provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For Parent's 2013 fiscal year, each Continuing
Employee shall (i) have a target annual bonus opportunity from Parent no less
than his or her target annual bonus opportunity for calendar year 2012 (and
any such Parent bonus shall be pro-rated to reflect that the Effective Time
occurs after the start of Parent's 2013 fiscal year, if applicable), and (ii)
receive an annual equity grant that is substantially comparable in amount and
terms to the equity grant provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
for such year; _provided_ that if Parent grants annual equity awards to
Continuing Employees in respect of Parent's 2013 fiscal year after the time
that it grants such awards in respect of such fiscal year to similarly
situated Parent employees, the applicable vesting periods and vesting dates
for such awards granted to Continuing Employees shall coincide with the
vesting periods and dates of comparable equity awards granted to similarly
situated Parent employees. From the Effective Time through December 31, 2013
(the " _Continuation Period_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be entitled to
continue to participate on the same basis in the Surviving Company's health,
welfare and retirement benefit plans as the Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Company's health, welfare and
retirement benefit plans, and during the Continuation Period Parent shall not
amend or terminate or cause the Surviving Company to amend or terminate any
such health, welfare or retirement benefit plan other than as required by Law
or in a manner which would not have an adverse impact on the benefits provided
under any such plan.

 (b) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan in which Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents will be eligible to participate at any time after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting (other than benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies under any defined benefit pension plan), service recognized by the Company and any Company Subsidiary immediately  

  

  

  

58

        

  



  

  

prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or the
Parent Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the date of initial participation of each Continuing Employee in
any Parent Benefit Plan shall be no earlier than (but may be after) the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that such service need not be
recognized (i) under any retiree medical plan or program of Parent or (ii) to
the extent that (A) the applicable Company Benefit Plan did not recognize such
service or (B) such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

(c) From the Effective Time through the first anniversary of
the Effective Time (the " _Severance Protection Period_ "), Parent shall
provide or cause the Surviving Company to provide to each Continuing Employee
(other than Continuing Employees who are party to Executive Employment
Agreements) whose employment is terminated by Parent or the Surviving Company
other than for cause (as such term is used for purposes of Parent's severance
arrangements during such period), the severance benefits set forth in Section
6.11(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, subject to the terminated employee's
execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in form and substance
equivalent to the release that Parent requires of similarly situated
employees, and during the Severance Protection Period Parent shall not amend
or terminate or cause the Surviving Company to amend or terminate its
commitment to provide such benefits.

  

(d) Within 30 days following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Company to, pay to each employee who was a
participant in the WICP for 2012 and who remains employed by the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a pro rata target award under the
WICP which becomes payable by reason of the Closing. With respect to
Continuing Employees who were participating in the AIP for 2012, Parent shall
pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each such Continuing Employee
who continues in employment for a period of two months following the Effective
Time (or who is involuntarily terminated without cause (as such term is used
for similarly situated employees of Parent) within such two month period) an
amount representing a pro rata target bonus (based on such employee\'s target
bonus opportunity in effect for 2012) for the period January 1, 2013 to the
Effective Time. Such payment shall be made within ten days following the
expiration of such two month period or following such termination of
employment, as the case may be.

  

(e) In consultation with Parent, the Company shall, or shall
cause the applicable Company Subsidiary to, provide all notices to, and engage
in any consultation procedures with, any trade unions, works councils or
similar bodies, in each case, that are required to be taken following the date
hereof, whether by Law, Contract, Collective Bargaining Agreement or
otherwise, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in
any event prior to the Closing Date).

  

(f) Nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to constitute an amendment to any Parent Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefits plan maintained for or
provided to employees, directors or consultants of Parent or the Company prior
to or following the Effective Time.

  

(g) Without otherwise limiting the generality of Section 9.07,
the provisions of this Section 6.11 are for the sole benefit of the parties to
this Agreement and

  

  

59

        

  

  

nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to
confer upon or give to any person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Continuing Employee or other current or former employee of the Company or any
of its Affiliates), other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies (including with respect to the matters provided for in this Section
6.11) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
Section 6.11 shall amend, or be deemed to amend (or, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.11, prevent the amendment or termination of) any
Company Benefit Plan or any Parent Benefit Plan. Parent shall have no
obligation to continue to employ or retain the services of any Continuing
Employee for any period of time following the Closing and, except as
specifically provided in this Section 6.11, Parent shall be entitled to modify
any compensation or benefits provided to, and any other terms or conditions of
employment of, any such employees in its absolute discretion.

  

SECTION 6.12 _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries_. Parent

prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

  

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before the End
Date. The " _End Date_ " shall mean the six month anniversary of the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing
shall have been satisfied or shall be then capable of being satisfied (other
than the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c)), the End Date may be extended
by Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, for one or
more 30-day periods up to an aggregate extension of three months from the
first End Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to extend or
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available
to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement directly or
indirectly causes the failure of the Closing to be consummated by the End
Date;

  

(ii) if the condition set forth in Section 7.01(d) is not
satisfied and the Legal Restraint giving rise to such non-satisfaction shall
have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the terminating party

that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(iii)
shall not be available to (A) the Company where the failure to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action or failure
to act of the Company and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach by the Company of this Agreement or (B) Parent where the failure to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been caused by the action
or failure to act of Parent or Merger Sub and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement;

  

(c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub has breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub has become
untrue, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or
Section 7.02(b), as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) unless any such breach or failure
to be true has not been cured within 30 days after written notice by the
Company to Parent informing Parent of such breach or failure to be true,
except that no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature
cannot be cured prior to the End Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Company may   

  



  

  

  

63

        

  

  

not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if the Company
is then in breach of this Agreement in any material respect;

  

(d) by the Company prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for
a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 5.02(d), _provided_ that the
Company pays the Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such
termination (it being understood that the Company shall be required to enter
into such definitive written agreement simultaneously with such termination of
this Agreement);

  

(e) by Parent, if the Company has breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case,
such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b), as
the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.01(e) unless any such breach or failure to be true has not been
cured within 30 days after written notice by Parent to the Company informing
the Company of such breach or failure to be true, except that no cure period
shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured prior to
the End Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) if Parent is then in breach of this
Agreement in any material respect;

  

(f) by Parent prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the
event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

  

(g) by Parent prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in the
event that (i) the Company shall have materially breached its obligations
under Section 5.02 (A) in a manner materially adverse to Parent or (B) which
results in the making of an Alternative Proposal, or (ii) the Company shall
have breached in any material respect its obligations under Section 6.01(d) by
failing to call, give notice of, convene or and/or hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.01(d).

  

SECTION 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
other than the penultimate sentence of Section 6.02, the reimbursement and
indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 6.08, this Section
8.02, Section 8.03 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such
termination, _provided_ , _however_ , that, no such termination shall relieve
any party from any liability or damages for any willful breach of this
Agreement, except in the event that the Company pays to Parent, and Parent
accepts as payment, the Termination Fee. For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act or omission
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a material breach of this Agreement; it being acknowledged and
agreed, without limitation, that any failure by any party to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby after the applicable
conditions thereto have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, which

  

  

  

64

        

  

  



  

conditions would be capable of being satisfied at such time) shall constitute
a willful breach of this Agreement.

  

SECTION 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as specifically provided for
herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are
consummated.

  

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $100,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") if:

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) (other
than as a result of any Adverse Recommendation Change made by the Company
relating to a Parent Material Adverse Effect) or Section 8.01(g); _provided_
that if either the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(iii) at any time after Parent would have been permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) (other than as a result
of any Adverse Recommendation Change made by the Company relating to a Parent
Material Adverse Effect) or 8.01(g), this Agreement shall be deemed terminated
pursuant to either Section 8.01(f) (other than as a result of any Adverse
Recommendation Change made by the Company relating to a Parent Material
Adverse Effect) or 8.01(g), as applicable, for purposes of this Section
8.03(b)(i); or

  

(ii) (A) an Alternative Proposal shall have been made to the
Company and not publicly withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company generally and not publicly withdrawn at least five
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or shall otherwise
become generally known to the public and not publicly withdrawn at least five
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting or any Person or
"Group" shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Alternative Proposal not subsequently publicly
withdrawn at least five Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i), 8.01(b)(iii) or 8.01(e); and (C) within 12 months of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive Contract to consummate any
Alternative Proposal or any Alternative Proposal is consummated; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.03(b)(ii), the references to
20% in the definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to 50.1%.

  

Any Termination Fee due under this Section 8.03(b) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above, on the
Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement
(or simultaneously with such termination, in the case of termination pursuant
to Section 8.01(d)) and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the date of
the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.

  

(c) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in Section 8.03(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and

  

  

65

       



  

that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
Section 8.03(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit, action or other proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor for
such payment, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, action
or other proceeding, together with interest on the amount of such payment from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at a
rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ __ on the date such interest begins accruing. The parties agree that
the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary
remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due
and payable, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company and the
acceptance of such Termination Fee by Parent, the Company, the Company\'s
Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to Parent and
Merger Sub under this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be obligated
to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall require Parent to accept the Termination Fee
or forego its right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10.

  

  

  

SECTION 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
however, that (i) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders,
and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall be
submitted to be approved by the stockholders of the Company unless required by
Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties.

  

SECTION 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No
extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required by Law. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  

SECTION 8.06 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.04 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.05 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its Board of Directors or the duly
authorized designee thereof. Termination of this Agreement prior to the
Effective Time shall not require the approval of the stockholders of either
Parent or the Company.
