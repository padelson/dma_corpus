or (ii) could, if there were an unfavorable decision, individually or in the
aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to result in a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Parent nor any director or officer thereof (in his
or her capacity as such), is or has been the subject of any Action involving
a claim or violation of or liability under federal or state securities laws
or a claim of breach of fiduciary duty, nor does the Parent have any reason to
believe that it or any of its officers or directors will be the subject of
any Action involving a claim or violation of or liability under federal or
state securities laws.

  



  

SECTION 4.10. _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. The Parent is in compliance
with all applicable Laws, except for instances of noncompliance that,

expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Parent has not
received any written communication during the past two years from a
Governmental Entity that alleges that the Parent is not in compliance in any
material respect with any applicable Law. The Parent is in compliance
with all effective requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, that are applicable to it,
except where such noncompliance could not have or reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

SECTION 4.11. _Contracts_. There are no Contracts that are material to the
business, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise), results of
operations or prospects of the Parent taken as a whole. The Parent is not in
violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a
violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations
or defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

knowledge, no proceedings for that purpose have been initiated or threatened
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  



  

SECTION 4.13. _Bankruptcy_. The Parent is not and has not been the subject of
any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, nor is it or has it been
a party to any material litigation or, within the past two years, the subject
of any threat of material litigation. For purposes hereof, litigation shall
be deemed "material" if the amount at issue exceeds the lesser of $10,000 per
matter or $25,000 in the aggregate.

  



  

SECTION 4.14. _Transactions With Affiliates and Employees_. None of the
officers or directors of the Parent and, to the knowledge of the Parent, none
of the employees of the Parent is presently a party to any transaction with
the Parent or any subsidiary (other than for services as employees, officers
and directors), including any contract, agreement or other arrangement
providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for rental of
real or personal property to or from, or otherwise requiring payments to or
from any officer, director or such employee or, to the knowledge of the
Parent, any entity in which any officer, director, or any such employee has a
substantial interest or is an officer, director, trustee or partner.

  



  

SECTION 4.15. _Application of Takeover Protections_. The Parent has taken all
necessary action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the
Parent's charter documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is
or could become applicable to the e-Marine Shareholders as a result of the
e-Marine Shareholders and the Parent fulfilling their obligations or
exercising their rights under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the issuance of the Exchange Shares and the e-Marine Shareholders' ownership
of the Exchange Shares.

  



  

SECTION 4.16. _No Additional Agreements_. The Parent does not have any
agreement or understanding with the e-Marine Shareholders with respect to the
Transactions other than as specified in this Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 4.17. _Investment Company_. The Parent is not, and is not an
affiliate of, and immediately following the Closing will not have become, an
"investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

  



  

SECTION 4.18. _Disclosure_. The Parent confirms that neither it nor any
person acting on its behalf has provided any e-Marine Shareholders or its
agents or counsel with any information that the Parent believes constitutes
material, non-public information except insofar as the existence and terms of
the proposed transactions hereunder may constitute such information and except
for information that will be disclosed by the Parent under a current report
on Form 8-K filed after the Closing. All disclosure provided to the e-Marine
Shareholders regarding the Parent, its business and the transactions
contemplated hereby, furnished by or on behalf of the Parent (including the
Parent's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement) are true
and correct and do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading

  



  

SECTION 4.19. _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. The Parent is, and has
no reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to
be, in compliance with the listing and maintenance requirements for continued
listing of its shares of common stock on the trading market on which such
shares are currently listed or quoted. The issuance and sale of the shares of
the Exchanges Securities under this Agreement does not contravene the rules
and regulations of the trading market on which the Parent's securities are
currently listed or quoted, and all approvals of the shareholders of the
Parent, as required for the Parent to issue and deliver to the e-Marine
Shareholders the Exchange Shares contemplated by this Agreement, have been
obtained.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

The undersigned is a current or former director, executive officer or
beneficial owner of shares of capital stock, or securities convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for the capital stock of Pollex, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (the " _Company_ "). The undersigned is party to that certain
Share Exchange Agreement (the "Agreement") with the Company and e-Marine Co.,
Ltd., a corporation formed under the laws of South Korea (" _e-Marine_ "),
pursuant to which the Company will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of e-Marine from the shareholders of e-Marine, in
consideration for an aggregate of 14,975,000 shares of common stock (the "
_Pollex Shares_ ") of the Company (the " _Share Exchange_ "). The undersigned
understands that the Company and e-Marine has proceeded with the Share
Exchange in reliance on this Lock-up Agreement.

  



  

1\. _Lockup. _ In consideration of the execution of the Agreement by the
Company and e-Marine and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned
agrees, that without the Company's prior written consent (which consent may
be withheld in its sole discretion), the undersigned will not, during the
period beginning on the date of the Agreement and ending upon the six (6)
month anniversary of this Agreement (the " _Lockup Period_ "), (i) offer,
sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, hedge, pledge, sell any option or
contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any
option, right or warrant to purchase or sell (or announce any offer, sale,
offer of sale, contract of sale, hedge, pledge, sale of any option or
contract to purchase, purchase of any option or contract of sale, grant of any
option, right or warrant to purchase or other sale or disposition), or
otherwise transfer or dispose of (or enter into any transaction or
device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the
disposition by any person at any time in the future), the Pollex Shares (the
" _Lock-Up Securities_ ") or (ii) enter into any swap or other agreement or
any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly,
the economic consequence of ownership of any Lock-Up Securities, whether or
not any such swap or transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to
be settled by delivery of any Lock-Up Securities.

  



  

2.  _Permitted Transfer._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned (and
any transferee of the undersigned) may transfer any Lock-Up Securities: (i)
as a bona fide gift or gifts, provided that prior to such transfer the donee
or donees thereof agree in writing to be bound by the restrictions set forth
herein, (ii) to any trust, partnership, corporation or other entity
formed for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the immediate
family of the undersigned, provided that prior to such transfer a duly
authorized officer, representative or trustee of such transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the restrictions set forth herein, and provided
further that any such transfer shall not involve a disposition for value,
(iii) to non-profit organizations qualified as charitable organizations under
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (iv) if
such transfer occurs by operation of law, such as rules of descent and
distribution, statutes governing the effects of a merger or a qualified
domestic order, provided that prior to such transfer the transferee executes
an agreement stating that the transferee is receiving and holding any Lock-Up
Securities subject to the provisions of this Lock-up Agreement. For purposes
hereof, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or
adoption, not more remote than first cousin.

among the undersigned as of the date hereof. This Lock-up Agreement (and the
agreements reflected herein) may be terminated by the mutual agreement of the
Company and the undersigned, and if not sooner terminated, will terminate
upon the expiration date of the Lockup Period. This Lock-up Agreement may be
duly executed by facsimile and in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to
constitute one and the same instrument. Signature pages from separate
identical counterparts may be combined with the same effect as if the parties

Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by each
of the parties hereto expressly so modifying or waiving such agreement.
