                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

          THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of April 28, 2002 (this
"AGREEMENT"), is entered into by and between The AES Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "SELLER"), and Ameren Corporation, a Missouri corporation (the
"PURCHASER").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

          WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares (the
"SHARES") of common stock, without par value (the "COMMON STOCK"), of CILCORP
Inc. (the "COMPANY"), an Illinois corporation and the parent company of Central
Illinois Light Company, an Illinois corporation ("CILCO"); and

          WHEREAS, each of the Boards of Directors of the Purchaser and the
Seller has approved the acquisition of the Company by the Purchaser, which
acquisition is to be effected by the purchase of all the Shares by the Purchaser
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I
                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

          Section 1.1 SALE AND TRANSFER OF SHARES. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined below), the Seller
agrees to sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser agrees to purchase and accept from the Seller, all of the Seller's
rights, title and interest in and to the Shares. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees to deliver to the Seller, and
the Seller agrees to accept, the Purchase Price (as defined below), in cash,
without deduction or setoff of any kind (other than any transfer Taxes described
in Section 6.7(m)), which delivery will be made by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the bank account or accounts designated by the Seller, in
writing, prior to the Closing.

          Section 1.2 THE PURCHASE PRICE.

               (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
consideration of the aforesaid sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and
delivery to the Purchaser of the Shares, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller
in cash the sum of (v) $1,340,000,000 (the "TRANSACTION PRICE"); (w) less an
amount equal to Assumed Obligations (as defined below); (x) increased by the
amount, if any, by which Working Capital (as defined

<Page>

below) as of the Closing Date exceeds the Base Working Capital (as defined
below), (y) decreased by the amount, if any, by which Working Capital as of the
Closing Date is less than the Base Working Capital, and (z) increased by the
amount of the CapEx Adjustment Amount (as defined in Section 5.1(e)) under
Section 5.1(e)(i) of this Agreement or decreased by the amount of the CapEx
Adjustment Amount under Section 5.1(e)(ii) of this Agreement (the net of such
amounts (v) through (z) being, the "PURCHASE PRICE"). An example of the Purchase
Price calculation is set forth in Section 1.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (as defined below).

               (b) The term "ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS" as used herein shall mean
amounts required to be included on the consolidated balance sheets of the
Company in accordance with GAAP (as defined in Section 3.4) as of the Closing
Date for long-term indebtedness (including current portion), short-term
indebtedness, capital lease obligations, preferred stock of subsidiaries and any
other obligation for borrowed money. Assumed Obligations shall be determined on
a basis consistent with past practice and consistent with the items outstanding
as of December 31, 2001 set forth on Section 1.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule but including any other outstanding obligation meeting the definition
of the preceding sentence at the applicable date set forth herein.

               (c) The term "WORKING CAPITAL" as used herein shall mean current
assets less current liabilities (not counting in current liabilities any
short-term indebtedness or current maturity of long-term debt included in
Assumed Obligations) of the Company as of the applicable date set forth herein
determined in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with past practice and
consistent with the calculation on Section 1.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, provided, however, that for the purposes of this definition, current
liabilities as of any date shall not include any Income Taxes payable, and
current assets shall not include receivables from any Income Tax assets. "INCOME
TAXES" shall mean any federal, state, local, or foreign Tax (as defined below)
determined by reference to net income, net worth, or any Tax imposed in lieu of
such a Tax. All intercompany (between the Company and its Subsidiaries on one
hand, and the Seller and its Subsidiaries, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand) payables and all intercompany receivables shall
be paid down to zero prior to the date the Estimated Purchase Price is
calculated and shall be zero as of the Closing Date.

               (d) The term "BASE WORKING CAPITAL" as used herein means the
amount shown on Section 1.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The Working
Capital as of the Closing Date shall be calculated in the same manner as the
Working Capital was calculated as set out on Section 1.2(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

               (e) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller a cash
amount (the "ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE") consisting of the sum of (i) the
Transaction Price, (ii) less the estimated Assumed Obligations, (iii) increased
by the amount, if any, by which the estimated Working Capital exceeds the Base
Working Capital, (iv) decreased by the amount, if any, by which estimated
Working Capital is less than the Base Working Capital and (v) increased or
decreased by the CapEx Adjustment Amount, all determined in good faith by the
Seller on the basis hereinabove set forth using the unaudited consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of

                                        2
<Page>

the last day of the month which precedes the month of the Closing Date by no
more than 45 days. The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser a written
calculation in reasonable detail of the Estimated Purchase Price on or prior to
the fifth business day preceding the Closing Date.

               (f) As promptly as practical, but in no event more than sixty
(60) days after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to prepare
and deliver to the Seller and the Purchaser a draft of a statement prepared in
good faith setting forth the relevant calculations resulting in the final
Purchase Price (the "PROPOSED FINAL PURCHASE PRICE STATEMENT") which shall show,
as of the Closing Date, the actual Assumed Obligations and variance, if any,
from the Base Working Capital. During the thirty (30) day period following the
delivery by the Company of the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement, the
Seller and its auditors may review such statement and the working papers of the
Company's auditors relating to the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement and
shall have such access to the Purchaser's and the Company's personnel as may be
reasonably necessary to permit the Seller and its auditors to review in detail
the manner in which the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement was prepared.
The Purchaser shall and shall cause the Company, as well as their advisors, to
cooperate with the Seller and the Seller's auditors in facilitating such review.
Upon completion of such review, the Seller shall give any comments or objections
it has with respect to the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement to the
Purchaser and the Company in writing within such thirty (30) day period (the
"OBJECTION LETTER"). The Purchaser and the Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any differences and issues as set forth in the Objection Letter. If no
Objection Letter is delivered or the matters set forth in the Objection Letter
are so resolved, then the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement, as adjusted
for any changes as are agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser, shall be
final and binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser and shall constitute the
final Purchase Price (the "FINAL PURCHASE PRICE"). If the matters raised by the
Seller in the Objection Letter cannot be resolved between the Purchaser and the
Seller within ten (10) days of the date of the Objection Letter, the question or
questions in dispute shall then be promptly submitted to any "big five"
accounting firm mutually agreeable to the Seller and the Purchaser (other than
the Seller's auditors, the Purchaser's auditors and Arthur Andersen LLP), or if
such accounting firm cannot or refuses to serve in such capacity, a mutually
acceptable firm of independent public accountants of recognized standing, the
decision of which as to such question or questions in dispute shall be final and
binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser and the determination of the purchase
price pursuant thereto shall be considered to be the Final Purchase Price. The
accounting firm shall be instructed to resolve solely the question or questions
in dispute within twenty (20) days of submission.

               (g) In the event the Final Purchase Price is greater than the
Estimated Purchase Price paid at the Closing by the Purchaser, then the
Purchaser shall promptly (within five (5) business days of the determination of
the Final Purchase Price) pay to the Seller an amount equal to the difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price. In the event
the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price paid at the
Closing by the Purchaser, then the Seller shall promptly (within five (5)
business days of the determination of the Final Purchase Price) pay to the
Purchaser an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price
and the Final Purchase Price.

                                        3
<Page>

               (h) The fees of the Company's auditors incurred in connection
with the preparation of the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement shall be
borne by the Purchaser, and the fees of the Seller's auditors incurred in
connection with their review of the Proposed Final Purchase Price Statement
shall be borne by the Seller. The fees of any independent accounting firm
appointed pursuant to this Section shall be borne equally by the Seller and the
Purchaser.

          Section 1.3 ADDITIONAL PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. In the event the
Closing occurs after the Trigger Date (as defined below), then the Purchase
Price shall be increased by $33,699 per day from the Trigger Date through the
Closing Date; provided, however, no amount shall be due and payable under this
Section 1.3 with respect to any day that is more than 365 days following the
Trigger Date or if this Agreement is terminated under Section 8.1 hereof. For
purposes of this Agreement, the "TRIGGER DATE" shall be the later of (i)
December 31, 2002, (ii) the date on which Seller is capable (without further
action by any third party) of completing performance in all material respects of
its agreements and covenants contained in or contemplated by this Agreement
which are required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing and (iii)
the date which is ninety (90) days following the date on which the Illinois
Commerce Commission ("ICC") grants its approval of the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE CLOSING

          Section 2.1 CLOSING. The consummation of the sale and transfer of the
Shares by the Seller to the Purchaser (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, 1440 New York Avenue, NW,
Washington, DC 20005 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second business day
immediately following the date on which the last of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof is fulfilled or waived (except for those conditions which by
their nature can only be fulfilled at the Closing), or at such other time, date
and place as the Seller and the Purchaser shall mutually agree (the "CLOSING
DATE").

          Section 2.2 DELIVERIES BY THE SELLER. At the Closing, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser:

               (a) A certificate or certificates representing the Shares, duly
and validly endorsed in favor of the Purchaser or accompanied by a separate
stock power duly and validly executed by the Seller and otherwise sufficient to
vest in the Purchaser good title to the Shares;

               (b) The resignations of the members of the Board of Directors of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined);

               (c) The stock books, stock ledgers, minute books, corporate seal
or their functional equivalent of the Company and each Company Subsidiary;
PROVIDED, that any of the foregoing items shall be deemed to have been delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.2(c) if such item has been delivered to, or is
otherwise located at, the offices of the Company;

                                        4

similar governing documents of the Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (ii) subject to obtaining the Seller Required Statutory Approvals,

Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any
of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except in the
case of clause (ii) or (iii) for any such Violation which would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the Seller's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

               (c) STATUTORY APPROVALS. Except for (i) the filings by the

APPROVALS"), no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to or
authorization, consent or approval of, any court, federal, state, local or
foreign governmental or regulatory body (including a national securities
exchange or other self-regulatory body) or authority (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITY") is necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Seller or the consummation by the Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except those which the failure to obtain would not result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the Seller's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (it being

                                        8
<Page>

understood that references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such Seller Required
Statutory Approvals shall mean making such declarations, filings or
registrations; giving such notices; obtaining such authorizations, consents or
approvals; and having such waiting periods expire as are necessary to avoid a
violation of law).

               (d) COMPLIANCE. To the knowledge of the Seller or the Company,
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of, is under
investigation with respect to any violation of, or has been given notice of or
been charged with any violation of, any law, statute, order, rule, regulation,
ordinance or judgment of any Governmental Authority, except for possible
violations which would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or would not
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Seller to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the knowledge of
the Seller and the Company, the Company and each Company Subsidiary have all
material permits, licenses, franchises and other governmental authorizations,
consents and approvals (collectively, "PERMITS") necessary to conduct their
businesses as presently conducted except those that the absence of which would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the ability of the Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Permit is in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms, (ii) there is no outstanding written notice, or to
the knowledge of the Seller or the Company, any other notice of revocation, and
there are no proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller or the
Company, threatened that seek the revocation, cancellation or termination of any
Permit. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach or violation
of or in default in the performance or observance of any term or provision of,
and no event has occurred which, with lapse of time or action by a third party,
could result in a default by the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, (i)
their respective articles of incorporation or by-laws or (ii) any contract,
commitment, agreement, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease, bond,
license, approval or other instrument to which it is a party or by which it is
bound or to which any of its property is subject, except in the case of clause
(ii) for possible violations, breaches or defaults which would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

and public utility laws and regulations, have been filed with the SEC, the FERC,
the ICC or any other applicable Governmental Authority, as the case may be, and

applicable requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules and
regulations thereunder. As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The audited consolidated

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
during the period involved (except as may be stated in the notes thereto) and
fairly present the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results

normal, recurring audit adjustments.

Company Subsidiary, of which the Seller or the Company has knowledge, that would

any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of any nature, except those which (i) are accrued or reserved against

thereto, (ii) were incurred in the ordinary course of business and would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (iii) have been discharged or paid in
full prior to the date hereof, or (iv) are of a nature not required to be
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied.

          Section 3.6 LITIGATION. There are no claims, suits, actions or
proceedings before any court, governmental department, commission, agency,
instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator pending or, to the knowledge of
the Seller or the Company, threatened against, relating to or affecting the
Company or any Company Subsidiary which would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Purchaser's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are
no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary except for such that would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or would prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Returns are correct, complete and accurate in all material respects, and all

material Tax withholding and deposit requirements imposed on or with respect to
the Seller, the Company and each Company Subsidiary (including any withholding
with respect to wages or other amounts paid to employees) have been satisfied in
full; (iii) there are no outstanding requests, agreements, consents or waivers
to extend the statutory period of limitations applicable to the assessment or
collection of any material Taxes or deficiencies against the Seller, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary; (iv) no federal, state, local, or foreign Audits for

          Section 3.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; ERISA.

               (a) COMPANY PLANS. Section 3.8(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule contains a true and complete list of each deferred compensation and
each bonus or other incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option and
other equity compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement; each
severance or termination pay, medical, surgical, hospitalization, life insurance
and other "welfare" plan, fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")); each
profit-sharing, stock bonus or other "pension" plan, fund or program (within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA); each employment, termination,
change-of-control, or severance agreement; and each other employee benefit plan,
fund, program, agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is sponsored,
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to by the Company, a
Company Subsidiary, or by any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,
that together with the Company, or a Company Subsidiary, would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"), or to which the Company, a Company Subsidiary or an
ERISA Affiliate is a party in each case for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company or a Company Subsidiary (the
"COMPANY PLANS").

                                       11
<Page>

               (b) DELIVERIES. With respect to each Company Plan, the Seller has
heretofore delivered or made available to the Purchaser true and complete copies
of, as applicable, (i) the Company Plan and any amendments thereto; (ii) if the
Company Plan is funded through a trust or any third party funding vehicle, a
copy of the trust or other funding agreement; and (iii) the most recent
determination letter received from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, and the
most recent letter of recognition of exemption with respect to any Company Plan
or related trust that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code; (iv) the most recent summary plan description and subsequent
summaries of material modifications; (v) the most recently filed Form 5500; and
(vi) the most recently prepared actuarial valuation report.

               (c) ABSENCE OF LIABILITY. No material liability under Title IV of
ERISA has arisen with respect to the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full and which would cause the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to incur any material liability, and, to the knowledge
of the Seller or the Company, no condition exists that presents a material risk
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary of incurring any such liability, other
than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
("PBGC") (which premiums have been paid when due).

               (d) FUNDING. No Company Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (a
"TITLE IV COMPANY PLAN"), Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or
any trust established thereunder and no other plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code maintained or contributed to by
any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived, as of the last day of the most recent fiscal year of such plan ended
prior to the Closing Date which deficiency could cause the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to incur any material liability. All contributions or
payments required to be made by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA
Affiliate with respect to any Company Plan have been timely made. The aggregate
accumulated benefit obligations of each Title IV Company Plan (as of the most
recent actuarial valuation date) do not exceed the fair market value of the
assets of such plan (as of the date of such valuation).

               (e) MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN. No Title IV Company Plan is a
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, nor is any
Title IV Company Plan a plan described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

               (f) NO VIOLATIONS. Each Company Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable law, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. No
investigation, audit or dispute relating to any Company Plan is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, threatened before any governmental
agency. None of the Seller, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Seller or the Company, any other "disqualified person" (within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) or "party in interest" (within the
meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA) has taken or omitted to take any action with
respect to any Company Plan which would

                                       12
<Page>

subject any such plan (or its related trust), the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any officer, director or employee of any of the foregoing to any
penalty or tax under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or
material liability for breach of fiduciary responsibility under ERISA. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has agreed to indemnify any other party
for any liabilities or expenses which have been or may in the future be incurred
by or asserted against such person with respect to any Company Plan, which
indemnification would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (g) SECTION 401(A) QUALIFICATION; EXEMPTION. Each Company Plan
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and has received a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that it is so qualified. To the knowledge
of the Seller and the Company, nothing has occurred since the issuance of such
letter which would affect such Company Plan's qualification. Each Company Plan
or related trust intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code meets such requirements and has received a letter of recognition of
exemption from the Internal Revenue Service to that effect. To the knowledge of
the Seller and the Company, nothing has occurred since the issuance of such
letter which could affect such Company Plan's or related trust's exemption under
Section 501(a) of the Code by reason of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

               (h) POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. No Company Plan provides medical,
surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured)
for employees or former employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
periods extending beyond their respective dates of retirement or other
termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii)
death benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of
which is borne by the current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

               (i) DEDUCTIBILITY. No amounts payable under the Company Plans
will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section
280G of the Code.

               (j) EFFECT OF CHANGE OF CONTROL. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in
combination with another related event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, officer or director of the Company to severance pay, unemployment

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the term
"PURCHASER MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" shall mean any material adverse effect on

delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Purchaser. No vote of, or consent by, the
holders of any class or series of stock issued by the Purchaser is necessary to
authorize the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement or the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Seller, constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser enforceable against it in

contemplated hereby will not, result in a Violation pursuant to any provisions
of (i) the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar governing documents
of the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining
the Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals, any statute, law, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (iii) subject
to obtaining the third-party consents set forth in Section 4.2(b)(iii) of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (the "PURCHASER REQUIRED CONSENTS"), any material
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, permit,
concession, contract, lease or other instrument, obligation or agreement of any
kind to which the Purchaser or any of the Purchaser Subsidiaries is a party or
by which they or any of their

                                       18

Seller, the Company and/or the Purchaser, as applicable, required under the HSR

the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (iii) any filings with or
approvals from (v) the FERC, (w) the SEC under PUHCA, (x) the ICC, (y) the FCC

APPROVALS"), no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to or
authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is necessary
for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser or the
consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
those which the failure to obtain would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (it being understood that references in this
Agreement to "obtaining" such Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals shall mean
making such declarations, filings or registrations; giving such notices;
obtaining such authorizations, consents or approvals; and having such waiting
periods expire as are necessary to avoid a violation of law).

               (d) COMPLIANCE. Neither the Purchaser nor any of the Purchaser
Subsidiaries is under investigation with respect to any violation of, or has
been given notice of or been charged with any violation of, any law, statute,
order, rule, regulation, ordinance or judgment of any Governmental Authority,
except for possible violations which would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Purchaser Subsidiaries
have all permits, licenses, franchises and other governmental authorizations,
consents and approvals necessary to conduct their businesses as presently
conducted except those that the absence of which would not prevent, materially
delay or materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Purchaser nor any of
the Purchaser Subsidiaries is in breach or violation of or in default in the
performance or observance of any term or provision of, and no event has occurred
which, with lapse of time or action by a third party, could result in a default
by the Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary under (i) their respective
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or (ii) any contract, commitment,
agreement, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease, bond, license,
approval or other instrument to which they are a party or by which the Purchaser
or any Purchaser Subsidiary is bound or to which any of their property is
subject, except for possible violations, breaches or defaults which would not
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Purchaser's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

required to be made by the Purchaser under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act have been filed with the SEC and complied, as of their respective dates, in
all material respects with all applicable

                                       19
<Page>

requirements of the appropriate statutes and the rules and regulations
thereunder. As of their respective dates, none of the Purchaser SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements of the Purchaser included in the Purchaser SEC Reports have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the period
involved (except as may be stated in the notes thereto) and fairly present the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows (and changes in financial position, if any) of the Purchaser as of
the time and for the period referred to therein, subject, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments.

          Section 4.4 LITIGATION. There are no claims, suits, actions or
proceedings by any court, governmental department, commission, agency,
instrumentality or authority or any arbitrator, pending or, to the knowledge of
the Purchaser, threatened against, relating to or affecting the Purchaser or any
Purchaser Subsidiaries which would prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. There are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or orders of
any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
authority or any arbitrator applicable to the Purchaser or any Purchaser
Subsidiaries except for such that would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

was done by the Purchaser and its affiliates and, to the extent the Purchaser
deemed appropriate, by the Purchaser's representatives. The Purchaser
acknowledges that it and its representatives have been provided adequate access
to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, the

provided or made available to the Purchaser or its directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives, and

the Seller, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, shareholders, affiliates, controlling Persons,
agents, advisors or representatives shall have any liability or responsibility
whatsoever to the Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, affiliates,
controlling Persons, agents or representatives on any basis (including in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based
upon any information provided or made available, or statements made (including
materials furnished in the Company's data room, presentations by the Company's
management, financial projections or otherwise) to the Purchaser or its
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, controlling Persons, advisors,
agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom), including in respect of
the specific representations and warranties of the Seller set forth in this
Agreement, except that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the Seller
insofar as the Seller makes the specific representations and warranties set
forth in Article III of this Agreement, but always subject to the limitations
and restrictions contained in Article IX.

to the officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, investment bankers,
financial advisors and other representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES")
of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the

Subsidiaries' properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company
Subsidiary to, furnish promptly to the Purchaser and its Representatives, (i)

destruction of any property owned by the Seller, the Company or the Company

the Representatives of the Purchaser during any visit to the business or
property sites of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date, whether pursuant to this Section 6.1 or otherwise. None of the Purchaser
nor any of its Representatives shall conduct any environmental testing or
sampling on any of the business or property sites of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date. Each party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, hold in strict confidence all documents and
information concerning the other furnished to it in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the

and between the Seller and the Purchaser (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

          Section 6.2 REGULATORY MATTERS.

               (a) HSR FILINGS. Each party hereto shall, as soon as practicable
as mutually agreed by the parties, file or cause to be filed with the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice any notifications required to be
filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino

                                       26
<Page>

Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT"), and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Such parties shall use all best efforts to respond on a
timely basis to any requests for additional information made by either of such
agencies.

               (b) OTHER REGULATORY APPROVALS. Each party hereto shall cooperate
and use best efforts to prepare and file as soon as practicable all necessary
documentation, to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings
and other documents, and to use best efforts to obtain all necessary permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary
or advisable to obtain the Seller Required Statutory Approvals and the Purchaser
Required Statutory Approvals. The parties further agree to use best efforts (i)
to take any act, make any undertaking or receive any clearance or approval
required by any Governmental Authority or applicable law and (ii) to satisfy any
conditions imposed by any Governmental Authority in all Final Orders (as defined
in and for purposes of Section 7.1(b)). Each of the parties shall (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any
Governmental Authority for additional information or documentation, and (ii) not
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior consent of
the other party hereto (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Each of the parties shall make best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade or energy regulation law
(including the Federal Power Act, as amended, and the FERC's regulations
thereunder) that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing Date to occur
as soon as reasonably possible. The steps involved in the preceding sentence
shall include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of such assets or businesses of the Purchaser or its affiliates (including their
respective Subsidiaries) or agreeing to such limitations on its or their conduct
or actions as may be required in order to obtain the Seller Required Statutory
Approvals and the Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals as soon as reasonably
possible, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Closing Date, and defending through litigation on the merits, including appeals,
any claim asserted in any court by any party.

               (c) EXCEPTION. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 6.2, neither party shall be required to take any actions that would have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, and,
further, any terms or conditions imposed by the FERC, the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
relating to market power, including but not limited to, divestiture of
generation or transmission improvements, shall not constitute a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

               (d) RESPONSIBILITIES. The Seller and the Purchaser agree that (i)
the Purchaser shall have primary responsibility for the preparation and filing
of any applications

                                       27
<Page>

with or notifications to the FERC, the FTC and/or the DOJ and the SEC under
PUHCA and (ii) the Seller and the Purchaser shall have joint responsibility for
the preparation and filing of any applications with or notifications to the ICC.
Each party shall have the right to review and approve in advance drafts of all
such necessary applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents
made or prepared in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

          Section 6.3 CONSENTS. The Seller and the Purchaser agree to use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Seller Required Consents and the Purchaser
Required Consents, respectively, and to cooperate with each other in connection
with the foregoing.

          Section 6.4 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a) INDEMNIFICATION. From and after the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall cause the Company, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law, to indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of
each of the foregoing) each present and former employee, agent, director or
officer of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (each, together with such
person's heirs, executors or administrators, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and
collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "ACTION"), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission by such Indemnified
Party in his or her capacity as an employee, agent, director or officer
occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the Closing Date
(including acts or omissions in connection with such person's service as an
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) or
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event of any such
Action, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense
of any such Action.

               (b) SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION. To the fullest extent not
prohibited by law, from and after the Closing Date, all rights to
indemnification now existing in favor of the Company Indemnified Parties with
respect to their activities as such prior to or on the Closing Date, as provided
in the Company's and each Company Subsidiary's respective articles of
incorporation, by-laws, other organizational documents or indemnification
agreements in effect on the date of such activities or otherwise in effect on
the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years from the Closing Date, PROVIDED
that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all such rights to indemnification in respect of any claim or claims
shall continue until final disposition of such claim or claims.

                                       28
<Page>

               (c) INSURANCE. For a period of six years after the Closing Date,
the Purchaser shall or the Purchaser shall cause the Company to maintain in
effect policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance equivalent to
those maintained by the Seller on behalf of the Company prior to the Closing
Date for the benefit of those persons who are currently covered by such policies
on terms no less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage;
provided, however, that the Purchaser will not be required to expend in any year
an amount in excess of 200% of the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by
the Seller or the Company, as the case may be, for such insurance; provided,
further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to obtain a policy with the best
coverage available, in the reasonable judgment of the board of directors of the
Purchaser for a cost not exceeding such amount.

               (d) SUCCESSORS. In the event that, after the Closing Date, the
Company or the Purchaser or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or a substantial portion of its properties and assets to any
Person or entity, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Company or the Purchaser, as the case
may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4.

               (e) BENEFIT. The provisions of this Section 6.4 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her other
representatives.

          Section 6.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Except as may be required by law or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts
to consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and the parties shall consult with each other regarding any
press releases initially announcing the execution of this Agreement.

          Section 6.6 WORKFORCE MATTERS.

               (a) If any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who
was an employee immediately prior to the Closing (an "AFFECTED EMPLOYEE") is
discharged by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of or after the Closing,
then the Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all severance costs for such
Affected Employee, including payments owing under those agreements, plans or
arrangements listed in Section 3.8(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for providing any continuation coverage required
under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
("COBRA") in respect of Affected Employees who experience or have experienced a
qualifying event (within the meaning of COBRA) prior to, on or after the Closing
Date including, without limitation, all other employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary who experience such a qualifying event before the Closing
Date but who do not provide notice of

                                       29
<Page>

the qualifying event until on or after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall be
responsible and assume all liability for all notices or payments due to any
Affected Employees under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "WARN ACT") or to any employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary who becomes entitled to receive notice as
required under the WARN Act on account of the aggregation of "employment losses"
in accordance with the WARN Act, and all notices, payments, fines or assessments
due to any Governmental Authority, pursuant to any applicable foreign, federal,
state or local law, common law, statute, rule or regulation with respect to the
employment, discharge or layoff of employees by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary after the Closing Date, including the WARN Act, and any comparable
state or local law.

               (b) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause CILCO to
honor its collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 51 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW LOCAL 51") in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, as well as the Letter Agreement dated as of
February 11, 2001 between CILCO and IBEW Local 51.

          Section 6.7 TAX MATTERS.

               (a) TAX RETURNS.


                    (i) The Seller shall file or cause to be filed when due all
     Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
     and each Company Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending on or
     before the Closing Date. The Seller shall include the income of the Company
     and each Company Subsidiary (including any deferred intercompany income
     triggered under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 or its predecessors
     and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.1502-19) on the AES consolidated U.S. federal Tax Returns for all
     periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

                    (ii) The Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due
     all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
     Company and each Company Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending
     after the Closing Date.

                    (iii) Any Tax Return required to be filed by the Purchaser
     relating to any taxable year or period that includes but does not end on
     the Closing Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD") shall be prepared in accordance with
     past practice (to the extent permitted under applicable law) and submitted
     (with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation
     then available) to the Seller for the Seller's approval not less than
     forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for the
     filing of such Tax Return. The Seller's approval shall not be unreasonably
     withheld.

                                       30
<Page>

                    (iv) Upon the written request of the Purchaser setting forth
     in detail the computation of the amount owed, the Seller shall pay to the
     Purchaser, no later than two (2) days prior to the due date for the
     applicable Tax Return, the Taxes for which the Seller is liable pursuant to
     Section 6.7(b) and that are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the
     Purchaser with respect to any Straddle Period.

                    (v) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date (and from
     time to time thereafter if the Seller reasonably requests), the Seller
     shall provide to the Purchaser a list of the specific Tax information
     materials required to enable Seller to prepare and file all Tax Returns
     required to be prepared and filed by Seller pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(i).
     Within sixty (60) days after receiving any such list, the Purchaser shall
     cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to prepare and provide to the
     Seller a package containing the Tax information materials identified in any
     such list. The Purchaser shall prepare such package in good faith in a
     manner substantially consistent with the Seller's past practice.

               (b) LIABILITY FOR TAXES.

                    (i) The Seller shall be liable for all Taxes with respect to
     Tax Returns described in Section 6.7(a)(i), for all Taxes apportioned to
     the Seller under Section 6.7(b)(iii), and for 50% of the Taxes described in
     Section 6.7(m). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be
     liable for Taxes that are not Income Taxes ("Non-Income Taxes") with
     respect to Tax Returns described in Section 6.7(a)(i) and for all
     Non-Income Taxes apportioned to the Seller under Section 6.7(b)(iii) to the
     extent that Non-Income Taxes reduce Working Capital.

                    (ii) The Purchaser shall be liable for all Taxes with
     respect to Tax Returns described in Section 6.7(a)(ii), for all Taxes
     apportioned to the Purchaser under Section 6.7(b)(iii), for 50% of the
     Taxes described in Section 6.7(m) and for Non-Income Taxes to the extent
     that Non-Income Taxes reduce Working Capital.

                    (iii) For purposes of this Section 6.7, where it is
     necessary to apportion between the Seller and the Purchaser the Tax
     liability of an entity for a Straddle Period (which is not treated under
     Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b) or similar provisions of state,
     local, or other law as closing on the Closing Date), such liability shall
     be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing
     Date, and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following
     the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except
     that Taxes (such as real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall
     be allocated on a daily basis.

                    (iv) In determining the Seller's liability for Taxes
     pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller shall be credited with the amount of
     estimated Taxes

                                       31
<Page>

     and any Taxes under the United States Federal Unemployment Tax Act or the
     United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act that are paid by or on
     behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Closing. To
     the extent that the Seller's liability for Taxes for a taxable year or
     period is less than the amount of such Taxes previously paid by or on
     behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to all or a
     portion of such taxable year or period, the Purchaser shall pay the Seller
     the difference within two (2) days of filing the Tax Return relating to
     such Taxes. To the extent that Non-Income Taxes paid by the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary with respect to any pre-Closing period are less than the
     amount of such Non-Income Taxes that reduce Working Capital, the Purchaser
     shall pay the Seller the difference within two (2) days of filing each Tax
     Return relating to such Non-Income Taxes.

               (c) REFUNDS.

                    (i) Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect
     thereof) received by the Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary,
     and any amounts credited against Taxes to which the Purchaser or a
     Purchaser Subsidiary (including the Company, or any Company Subsidiary)
     becomes entitled (including by way of any amended Tax Returns but excluding
     Tax Returns from a carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or
     portion thereof of the Company or a Company Subsidiary ending on or before
     the Closing Date, shall be for the account of the Seller, and the Purchaser
     shall pay over to the Seller any such refund or the amount of any such
     credit within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such refund or utilization
     of such credit. Any Tax refund from a carryback filing not prohibited under
     Section 6.7(e)(iii) shall be for the account of the Purchaser.

                    (ii) The Purchaser shall pay the Seller interest at the rate
     prescribed under Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any
     amount not paid when due under this Section 6.7(c). For purposes of this
     Section 6.7(c), where it is necessary to apportion a refund or credit
     between the Purchaser and the Seller for a Straddle Period, such refund or
     credit shall be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close
     of the Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the
     day following the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the
     books of the Company and any Company Subsidiary, except that Taxes (such as
     real property Taxes) imposed on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a
     daily basis.

                    (iii) The Purchaser shall cooperate, and shall cause the
     Company and any Company Subsidiary to cooperate, in obtaining, at the
     Seller's expense, any Tax refund (other than a refund based on a carryback
     from a taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date) that the
     Seller reasonably

                                       32
<Page>

     believes is available based on substantial authority, including through
     filing appropriate forms with the applicable Tax authority.

               (d) CERTAIN POST-CLOSING SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS.

                    (i) If the examination of any federal, state, local or other
     Tax Return of the Seller for any taxable period ending on or before the
     Closing Date shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any adjustment
     that permits the Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary to
     increase deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease the income, gains or
     recapture of tax credits which would otherwise (but for such adjustments)
     have been reported or taken into account (including by way of any increase
     in basis) by the Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary for one
     or more periods beginning and ending within ten (10) years after the
     Closing Date, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser and provide it with
     adequate information so that the Purchaser can reflect on its, the
     Company's, or Company Subsidiary's Tax Returns such increases in
     deductions, losses or tax credits or decreases in income, gains or
     recapture of tax credits. The Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, within
     thirty (30) days of the filing of the Tax Returns for the taxable year in
     which the Tax Benefit was realized, the amount of any resulting Tax
     Benefit. "Tax Benefit" shall mean the amount of any refund, credit or
     reduction in otherwise required Tax payments, including any interest
     payable thereon, actually realized, PROVIDED, that, for these purposes, Tax
     items shall be taken into account in accordance with the ordering
     principles of the Code or other applicable law. For purposes of this
     Section 6.7(d)(i), estimated Tax payments shall not be considered Tax
     Returns and Tax Benefits shall be based on Tax Returns as filed.

                    (ii) If the examination of any federal, state, local or
     other Tax Return of the Purchaser, the Company, or any Company Subsidiary
     for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date shall result (by
     settlement or otherwise) in any adjustment that permits the Seller to
     increase deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease the income, gains or
     recapture of tax credits which would otherwise (but for such adjustments)
     have been reported or taken into account (including by way of any increase
     in basis) by the Seller for one or more periods ending on or before the
     Closing Date, the Purchaser shall notify the Seller and provide it with
     adequate information so that the Seller can reflect on its Tax Returns such
     increases in deductions, losses or tax credits or decreases in income,
     gains or recapture of tax credits. The Seller shall pay to the Purchaser,
     within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such information, fifty percent
     (50%) of the amount of any resulting Tax Benefits.

               (e) POST-CLOSING ACTIONS THAT AFFECT THE SELLER'S LIABILITY FOR
TAXES.

                                       33
<Page>

                    (i) The Purchaser shall not take, or cause or permit the
     Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their affiliates) to take, any
     action, with respect to the taxable year or period of the Purchaser, the
     Company, any Company Subsidiary, or affiliate, as applicable, which
     includes the Closing Date, which would be reasonably likely to increase the
     Seller's or any of its affiliates' liability for Taxes (including any
     liability of the Seller to indemnify the Purchaser for Taxes pursuant to
     this Agreement) including, for example, any action that would be reasonably
     likely to, result in, or change the character of, any income or gain that
     the Seller or any Seller affiliate must report on any Tax Return.

                    (ii) None of the Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser
     shall (or shall cause or permit the Company or any of the Company
     Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating
     in whole or in part to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries with
     respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date
     (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent
     of the Seller, which consent may be withheld in the sole discretion of the
     Seller; provided, that the Seller's consent shall not be required for
     modifications that relate exclusively to the post-Closing Date portion of a
     Straddle Period and that would not be reasonably likely to increase the
     Seller's liability for Taxes under Section 6.7(i) of this Agreement.

                    (iii) Except to the extent otherwise required by law, none
     of the Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser shall (or shall cause or
     permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to) carry back for
     federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes to any taxable period, or
     portion thereof, of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
     Seller or any affiliate of the Seller ending on or before, or which
     includes, the Closing Date any operating losses, net operating losses,
     capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in, resulting from, or
     generated in connection with a taxable year of the Purchaser or any
     affiliate of the Purchaser, or portion thereof, ending after the Closing
     Date.

               (f) TAX PAYMENTS. The Purchaser agrees that, pursuant to any Tax
sharing, Tax allocation, or Tax indemnity agreements between the Seller or any
Seller affiliate on the one hand, and the Company or any Company Subsidiary on
the other hand, the Company or any Company Subsidiary may make tax sharing
payments to the Seller on any date or dates up to and including the Closing
Date. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 6.7(f) shall comply with the
terms of the agreement to which it relates (other than terms requiring payment
on a specified date or dates). Payments to the Seller pursuant to this Section
6.7(f) shall reduce the cash component of Working Capital as of the Closing
Date.

               (g) ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing Date, each of
the Seller and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates
to, execute any forms necessary to filing a Tax Return and provide information
to the other party regarding the

                                       34
<Page>

Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with (i) the other party
preparing any Tax Returns that such other party is responsible for preparing and
filing, and (ii) the other party preparing for any audits of, or disputes with
any Tax authority regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. In connection therewith, the Seller and the Purchaser shall not
dispose of any Tax work papers, books or records relating to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary during the six-year period following the Closing Date, and
thereafter shall give the other parties reasonable written notice before
disposing of such items.

               (h) SECTION 338 ELECTIONS. Neither the Seller nor the Purchaser
shall make or file any election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar
provision of the law of any state or other taxing jurisdiction) with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of all Tax Returns and other
applicable filings, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each report the stock
purchase as a purchase and sale, respectively, of the Shares.

               (i) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLER. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement other than Section 6.7(b)(iv), the Seller shall
indemnify the Purchaser from and against and in respect of:

                    (i) any liability for Taxes imposed on the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary as members of the "affiliated group" (within the meaning
     of Section 1504(a) of the Code) of which the Seller (or any predecessor or
     successor) is the common parent that arises under Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.1502-6(a) or any comparable provision of foreign, state or local
     law;

                    (ii) any liability for Taxes imposed on the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
     the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
     such Straddle Period deemed to end on and include the Closing Date;
     provided, that any indemnification for Non-Income Tax liabilities under
     this Section 6.7(i)(ii) shall apply only to the extent such Non-Income Tax
     liabilities exceed the amount by which Non-Income Taxes reduce Working
     Capital;

                    (iii) any liability for Taxes for which the Seller is
     responsible under Section 6.7(m); and

                    (iv) and for payments made to satisfy the indemnity to
     MACTEC, Inc. under the agreement described in Section 3.7(a)(v) of the
     Seller Disclosure Schedule; PROVIDED that any indemnification for such
     MACTEC, Inc. payments that are accrued as Non-Income Taxes for purposes of
     determining Working Capital shall apply only to the extent that such
     payments exceed the amount by which Non-Income Taxes reduce Working
     Capital; PROVIDED, further that any payments received from MACTEC, Inc.
     under the agreement described in Section 3.7(a)(v) of the Seller Disclosure
     Schedule shall be for the Seller's account.

                                       35
<Page>

Any indemnification under this Section 6.7(i) shall give effect to any related
Tax Benefit and be net of any reserves and amounts recovered from third parties,
including amounts recovered through utility rate increases. The indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.7(i) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Purchaser against the Seller with respect to any liability for Taxes in
connection with this Agreement.

               (j) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller from and
against and in respect of:

                    (i) any liability for Taxes imposed on any of the Company or
     any Company Subsidiary for any taxable year or period that begins after the
     Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
     Straddle Period beginning the day after the Closing Date; and

                    (ii) any liability for Taxes for which the Purchaser is
     responsible under Section 6.7(m).

Any indemnification under this Section 6.7(j) shall give effect to any related
Tax Benefit and be net of any reserves and amounts recovered from third parties,
including amounts recovered through utility rate increases. The indemnification
pursuant to this Section 6.7(j) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Seller against the Purchaser with respect to any liability for Taxes in
connection with this Agreement.

               (k) CONTESTS.

                    (i) NOTICE. After the Closing Date, the Seller and the
     Purchaser each shall notify the other party in writing within fifteen (15)
     days of the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial
     proceeding affecting the Taxes of any of the Company or any Company
     Subsidiary that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer ( the "TAX
     INDEMNITEE") or after the lapse of time would be grounds for
     indemnification under this Section 6.7 by the other party (the "TAX
     INDEMNITOR"). Such notice shall contain factual information describing any
     asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any
     notice or other document received from any Tax authority in respect of any
     such asserted Tax liability. If either the Seller or the Purchaser fails to
     give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required
     under this Agreement, then (A) if the Tax Indemnitor is precluded by the
     failure to give prompt notice from contesting the asserted Tax liability in
     any judicial forum, then such party shall not have any obligation to
     indemnify the other party for any Losses arising out of such asserted Tax
     liability and (B) if the Tax Indemnitor is not so precluded from
     contesting, if such failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to
     the Tax Indemnitor, then any amount which the Tax Indemnitor is otherwise
     required to pay pursuant to this Section 6.7 with respect to such liability
     shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

                                       36
<Page>

                    (ii) CONTROL OF CONTESTS INVOLVING PRE-CLOSING PERIODS OR
     STRADDLE PERIODS. In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial
     proceeding involving any asserted liability for Taxes relating to any
     taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date or any
     Straddle Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the Seller shall
     have the right, at its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or
     proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Seller shall keep the Purchaser
     reasonably informed with respect to the status of such audit or proceeding
     and provide the Purchaser with copies of all written correspondence with
     respect to such audit or proceeding in a timely manner and (ii) if such
     audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to result in a material
     increase in Tax liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
     which the Purchaser would be liable under this Section 6.7, (A) the
     Purchaser may participate in the conduct of such audit or proceeding at its
     own expense and (B) the Seller shall not settle any such audit or
     proceeding without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
     unreasonably withheld.

                    (iii) CONTROL OF CONTESTS INVOLVING POST-CLOSING PERIODS. In
     the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding involving any
     asserted liability for Taxes relating to any taxable years or periods
     beginning after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have the right, at
     its expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that if such audit or proceeding would be reasonably expected to
     result in a material increase in Tax liability of the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary for which the Seller would be liable under this Section
     6.7, (A) the Seller may participate in the conduct of such audit or
     proceeding at its own expense and (B) the Purchaser shall not settle any
     such audit or proceeding without the consent of the Seller, which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld.

               (l) TERMINATION TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. On or before the Closing
Date, the Seller shall cause all Tax sharing, Tax allocation, or Tax indemnity
agreements between the Seller or any Seller affiliate on the one hand, and the
Company or any Company Subsidiary on the other hand, to be terminated as of the
Closing Date (or an earlier date) and the agreements will have no further effect
for any taxable year (current, future, or past).

               (m) TRANSFER TAXES. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser and the Seller shall each pay 50% of
(i) all transfer (including real property transfer and documentary transfer)
Taxes and fees imposed with respect to the sale and transfer of Shares
contemplated hereby and (ii) all sales, use, gains (including state and local
transfer gains), excise and other transfer or similar Taxes imposed with respect
to the sale and transfer of Shares contemplated hereby. The Seller shall execute
and deliver to the Purchaser at the Closing any certificates or other documents
as the Purchaser may reasonably request to perfect any exemption from any such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, gains, excise or other Taxes, or to otherwise
comply with any applicable reporting requirements with respect to any such
Taxes.

                                       37
<Page>

               (n) RETENTION OF TAX ATTRIBUTES. The Seller may elect to retain
the Tax attributes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including net
operating losses and capital loss carryovers of such entities, to the extent
permitted under the Code, Treasury Regulations, other pronouncements of the
Internal Revenue Service, or other applicable law. At the Seller's request, the
Purchaser will, and will cause any Purchaser Subsidiary, the Company, and any
Company Subsidiary to, take any actions necessary to effect such elections of
the Seller.

               (o) TREATMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. The Seller, the Purchaser and
their respective Subsidiaries shall treat the Final Purchase Price as the
purchase price for the sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery to
the Purchaser of the Shares in preparing and filing their Tax Returns and shall
take no position inconsistent therewith in any proceeding before any taxing
authority or otherwise unless otherwise required pursuant to a final resolution
of any Tax for a taxable year that, under applicable law, is not subject to
further appeal, review or modification through proceedings or otherwise.

          Section 6.8 FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

               (a) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other
and their respective accountants, counsel and other representatives, during
normal business hours, such information (including records pertinent to the
Company) as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting and accounting
matters.

               (b) The Purchaser shall retain all of the books and records of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date for so long as
required by law. After the end of such period, before disposing of such books or
records, the Purchaser shall give notice to such effect to the Seller and give
the Seller an opportunity to remove and retain all or any part of such books or
records as the Seller may select.

          Section 6.9 TERMINATION OF AFFILIATE CONTRACTS. Except as set forth on
Section 6.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and except as agreed to in writing
by the Seller and the Purchaser, all Affiliate Contracts, including any
agreements or understandings (written or oral) with respect thereto, shall
terminate simultaneously with the Closing without any further action or
liability on the part of the parties thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the absence of a written agreement, the provision of any services (similar to
those contemplated by the preceding sentence) by the Seller to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary from and after the Closing, which services may be
provided by the Seller in its sole discretion, shall be for the convenience, and
at the expense, of the Purchaser, upon mutually agreed terms.

          Section 6.10 LOCAL PRESENCE; CHARITABLE GIVING.

               (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and
CILCO to maintain for a period of at least three (3) years following the Closing
(i) CILCO's corporate headquarters in Peoria, Illinois or other significant
local presence, and (ii) the name of

                                       38
<Page>

CILCO; provided that CILCO may be referred to as "AmerenCILCO" or as an "Ameren
Company".

               (b) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and
CILCO to maintain, for a period of at least three (3) years following the
Closing, a commitment to local social responsibility, community involvement and
charitable giving at its current levels in accordance with its current
practices.

          Section 6.11 SELLER'S NAME. The Purchaser shall not acquire, nor shall
the Company and its Subsidiaries retain, any rights to the name "AES" (or any
derivation thereof) or any trademark, trade name or symbol related thereto. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to remove the name "AES" (or any derivation thereof) and all
trademarks, trade names or symbols related thereto from the properties and
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

          Section 6.12 COOPERATION. The Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company and each Company Subsidiary to, cooperate with the Purchaser in
integration opportunities and in planning for the integration of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries into the Purchaser's corporate family and systems and
in preparation for Closing and the period thereafter.

          Section 6.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, execute such further documents or instruments and take such
further actions as may reasonably be requested by the other party in order to
consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                   CONDITIONS

          Section 7.1 CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE
CLOSING. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Closing shall be
subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions, except, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that such
conditions may be waived in writing pursuant to Section 9.3 by the joint action
of the parties hereto:

               (a) NO INJUNCTION. No temporary restraining order or preliminary
or permanent injunction or other order by any federal or state court preventing
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been issued and
be continuing in effect, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have
been prohibited under any applicable federal or state law or regulation
(collectively, "RESTRAINTS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each of the parties shall
have used all reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any such Restraints and
to appeal as promptly as possible any such Restraints that may be entered.

               (b) STATUTORY APPROVALS. The Seller Required Statutory Approvals
and the Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals shall have been obtained at or
prior to the Closing

                                       39
<Page>

Date by a Final Order. A "FINAL ORDER" shall mean action by the relevant
regulatory authority which has not been reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside,
annulled or suspended, with respect to which any waiting period prescribed by
law before the transactions contemplated thereby may be consummated has expired
(but without the requirement for expiration of any applicable rehearing or
appeal period), and as to which all conditions to the consummation of such
transactions prescribed by law, regulation or order have been satisfied.

               (c) HSR ACT. All applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
shall have expired or been terminated.

          Section 7.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF THE PURCHASER TO EFFECT THE
CLOSING. The obligation of the Purchaser to effect the Closing shall be further
subject to the satisfaction, on or prior to the Closing Date, of the following
conditions, except as may be waived by the Purchaser in writing pursuant to
Section 9.3:

               (a) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER. The Seller will
have performed in all material respects its agreements and covenants contained
in or contemplated by this Agreement which are required to be performed by it at
or prior to the Closing.

               (b) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
(i) on and as of the date hereof and (ii) on and as of the Closing Date with the
same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and
as of the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties that expressly
speak only as of a specific date or time which need only be true and correct as
of such date or time) except in each of cases (i) and (ii) for such failures of
representations or warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to
any materiality qualification or standard contained in any such representations
and warranties) which would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

               (c) CLOSING CERTIFICATES. The Purchaser shall have received a
certificate signed by the Seller, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(b) have been satisfied
and to the further effect that, as of the respective dates of reports filed with
the SEC by the Company and Company Subsidiaries under the Securities Act and
Exchange Act since January 1, 2001, and as of the Closing Date, such reports did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
that as of the Closing Date there has not been any development or combination of
developments affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary, of which the
Seller or the Company has knowledge, that would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

               (d) SELLER REQUIRED CONSENTS. The Seller Required Consents, the
failure of which to obtain would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, shall
have been obtained.

                                       40
<Page>

               (e) REGULATORY APPROVALS. The Final Orders of any Governmental
Authority having authority over the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall have been received and shall not impose terms or conditions (which are in
addition to terms and conditions due to existing laws, rules or regulations),
which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, provided, however, that any terms or conditions imposed by the
FERC, the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice relating to market power, including but not limited
to, divestiture of generation or transmission improvements, will not constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 7.3 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF THE SELLER TO EFFECT THE
CLOSING. The obligation of the Seller to effect the Closing shall be further
subject to the satisfaction, on or prior to the Closing Date, of the following
conditions, except as may be waived by the Seller in writing pursuant to Section
9.3:

               (a) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE PURCHASER. The Purchaser

               (b) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations and
warranties of the Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall be true and
correct (i) on and as of the date hereof and (ii) on and as of the Closing Date
with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been made
on and as of the Closing Date (except for representations and warranties that
expressly speak only as of a specific date or time which need only be true and
correct as of such date or time) except in each of cases (i) and (ii) for such
failures of representations or warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any materiality qualification or standard contained in any such
representations and warranties) which would not prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

               (c) CLOSING CERTIFICATES. The Seller shall have received a
certificate signed by the Purchaser, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that
the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b) have been
satisfied and to the further effect that, as of the respective dates of reports
filed with the SEC by the Purchaser under the Securities Act and Exchange Act
since January 1, 2001, and as of the Closing Date, such reports did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

               (d) PURCHASER REQUIRED CONSENTS. The Purchaser Required Consents,
the failure of which to obtain would prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the Purchaser's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall have been obtained.

                                   TERMINATION

          Section 8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date (the "TERMINATION DATE"):

               (a) by mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser;

               (b) by the Purchaser or the Seller, if any state or federal law,
order, rule or regulation is adopted or issued, which has the effect, as
supported by the written opinion of outside counsel for such party, of
prohibiting the Closing, or by any party hereto if any court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or any state shall have issued an order,
judgment or decree permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Closing, and such order, judgment or decree shall have become final and
nonappealable;

               (c) by the Purchaser or the Seller, by written notice to the
other party, if the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or before March 27,
2003 (the "INITIAL TERMINATION DATE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the right to
terminate the Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have
proximately contributed to the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before
such date; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if on the Initial Termination Date the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 7.1(b), 7.1(c) and/or 7.2(e)
shall not have been fulfilled but all other conditions to the Closing shall be
fulfilled or shall be capable of being fulfilled, then the Initial Termination
Date shall be extended for a twelve-month period;

               (d) by the Purchaser, by written notice to the Seller, if there
shall have been a material breach of any representation or warranty, or a
material breach of any covenant or agreement of the Seller hereunder, which
breaches would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and such breach
shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Seller
of notice in writing from the Purchaser, specifying the nature of such breach
and requesting that it be remedied or the Purchaser shall not have received
adequate assurance of a cure of such breach within such thirty (30) day period
or the Seller shall not have made a capital contribution to the Company in an
amount equal to the expected damages from such breach;

               (e) by the Seller, by written notice to the Purchaser, if there
shall have been a material breach of any representation or warranty, or a
material breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser hereunder, which
breaches would prevent, materially delay or materially impair the Purchaser's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
breach shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Purchaser of notice in writing from the Seller, specifying the nature of such
breach and requesting that it be remedied or the Seller shall not have received
adequate assurance of a cure of such breach within such thirty (30) day period;
or

               (f) by the Purchaser, by written notice to the Seller, to the
extent the Purchaser is not in breach of this Agreement, if the condition to the
Purchaser's obligation to

                                       42
<Page>

effect the Closing contained in Section 7.2(e) cannot be met in spite of the
Purchaser's use of its best efforts to obtain such Seller Required Regulatory
Approvals and Purchaser Required Regulatory Approvals, including seeking to
exhaust any rehearing or refiling opportunities relating to such approvals.

          Section 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Seller or the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1, there
shall be no liability on the part of either the Seller or the Purchaser or their
respective officers or directors hereunder, EXCEPT (a) that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement and (b) that
Sections 8.2, 9.2, 9.4, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9, 9.10, 9.11, 9.12, 9.13, and the agreement
contained in the last sentence of Section 6.1 shall survive the termination.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

          Section 9.1 SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS. All representations, warranties,
covenants, obligations and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement
or in any instrument, certificate, opinion or other writing provided for herein,
shall not survive the Closing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the representation and
warranty of the Seller contained in Section 3.2(b), the representation and
warranty of the Purchaser contained in Section 4.6(c) and the covenants of the
Seller and the Purchaser contained in Sections 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9,
6.10, 6.11 and the second sentence of Section 6.1 shall survive the Closing and
provided further, that the prohibition on solicitation for employment contained
in Section 5.1(r) shall continue in full force and effect for 12 months
following the Closing Date.

          Section 9.2 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement may be amended,
modified and supplemented in any and all respects, but only by a written
instrument signed by each of the parties hereto expressly stating that such
instrument is intended to amend, modify or supplement this Agreement.

          Section 9.3 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing Date,
a party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

          Section 9.4 EXPENSES. All costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses except that the fee payable in connection with
the filing required by the HSR Act shall be shared one-half by Seller and
one-half by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any

                                       43
<Page>

action or proceeding brought to enforce any provisions of this Agreement, or
where any provision hereof is validly asserted as a defense, the successful
party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
in addition to its costs and expenses and any other available remedy.

          Section 9.6 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Side Agreement Relating To
CILCO/ENRON Contract of even date herewith among the Seller, the Company and the
Purchaser, and the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement between the Seller and
the Purchaser of even date herewith (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) are
not intended to confer, and shall not confer, upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and thereto and Company Indemnified Parties as set forth in
Section 6.4 any remedies, claims of liability or reimbursement, causes of action
or any other rights whatsoever.

          Section 9.7 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision
hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration,
area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

          Section 9.8 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

          Section 9.9 VENUE. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c)
agrees that it shall not bring any action relating to this Agreement in any
court other than a federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware.

          Section 9.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL AND CERTAIN DAMAGES. Each party to
this Agreement waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, (a)
any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and (b) any right it may
have to receive damages from any other party based on any

                                       45
<Page>

theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential (including lost
profits) or punitive damages.

          Section 9.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in
addition to any other remedies at law or in equity.

          Section 9.12 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
the other party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Seller may transfer the Shares to a
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Seller as long as such Subsidiary agrees in
writing to be bound by the applicable terms of this Agreement and no such
assignment shall relieve the Seller from its obligations hereunder.

          Section 9.13 INTERPRETATION. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement,
respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words
"INCLUDE," "INCLUDES" or "INCLUDING" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "WITHOUT LIMITATION." Any item or other
matter referenced or disclosed in one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
have been referenced or disclosed in all sections of such Disclosure Schedule
where such reference or disclosure is required. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

          Section 9.14 COUNTERPARTS; EFFECT. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including via facsimile) in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the
same agreement.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller and the Purchaser have caused this
