the Accountants (with a copy to Buyer) a copy of its Objection Notice and
requesting the Accountants to resolve the disputes set forth in the Objection
Notice in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall cause the
Accountants to promptly review the Objection Notice, this Agreement,
the Earnout Calculation Schedule, and the Earnout Consideration and the
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating the Earnout
Consideration. In making such calculation, the Accountants shall
independently determine the Earnout Consideration in accordance with this
Agreement and shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable,
a written report setting forth their calculation of the Earnout
Consideration. Buyer and Seller shall provide such information to the
Accountants as the Accountants may request in connection with their review of
the Earnout Calculation Schedule and Earnout Consideration. The costs and
expenses for the services of the Accountants shall be borne by Seller and
Buyer in proportion to the extent to which the Accountants accept
the respective positions of Seller and Buyer. For example, if Seller asserts
that the Earnout Consideration should be increased by (Euro) 10,000 and Buyer
asserts that no adjustment in the Earnout Consideration is warranted, and
the Accountants determine that the Earnout Consideration should be increased
by (Euro) 4,000, Seller is responsible for 60% and Buyer is responsible for
40% of the costs of the Accountants.   (c) PAYMENT OF EARNOUT
CONSIDERATION. The Earnout Consideration shall be due and payable on the
third Business Day after the Earnout Consideration is finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.03. The Earnout Consideration shall be paid
50% in cash and 50% by Buyer delivering the RandM; Parent Note B to Seller. The
50% of the Earnout Consideration payable in cash shall bear interest at a
rate of 6.0% per annum until paid, with such interest beginning to accrue on
the earlier of February 28, 2002 and 10 days after Buyer has received the
necessary financial information to calculate the Earnout Payment Any amount
not timely paid shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Default
Rate set forth in the RandM; Parent Note Agreement until the same is paid.  
(d) PRELIMINARY EARNOUT RELATED INFORMATION. During the period from
the Closing Date through December 31, 2001, Buyer hereby agrees to furnish
to Seller, upon his request,    -9-  15  such financial information
concerning the Companies for the then most recently completed fiscal month of
the Companies that would be relevant to the calculation of the Earnout
Consideration in accordance with EXHIBIT A. Seller understands and
acknowledges that such information is being furnished in preliminary form and
without formal review and is subject to additional review and normal year-end
adjustments consistent with the procedures applicable to Buyer\'s preparation
of the Earnout Calculation Schedule.   (e) SUBSEQUENT EARNOUT REVIEW.
Notwithstanding anything included in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
shall be entitled to initiate a subsequent Earnout Consideration review (the
"SUBSEQUENT EARNOUT REVIEW") if Buyer notifies Seller at any time prior to
December 31, 2002 that (i) the Earnout Calculation Schedule, when previously
finalized in accordance with this Agreement, included sales of products of
the Companies which products were returned to one of the Companies prior to
March 31, 2003 ("RETURNED PRODUCTS") provided, however, Returned Products
shall not include any products tendered as a trade-in on another product of
one of the Companies or as an exchange or swap for another product of one of
the Companies, (ii) the calculation of the Earnout Consideration after
eliminating the sales and EBITDA attributable to the Returned Products would
result in the Earnout Consideration being at least (Euro) 250,000 less than
previously determined in accordance with this Agreement, and (iii) Buyer
includes with such notice a revised Earnout Calculation Schedule showing the
Earnout Consideration after eliminating the Returned Products. Upon Seller\'s
receipt of the revised Earnout Calculation Schedule, the procedures under
this Section 2.03 that were applicable to the previously furnished Earnout
Calculation Schedule, including a new Objection Period, Objection Notice, and
Accountants\' review shall be followed in connection with the Subsequent
Earnout Review. Any adjustment in the Earnout Consideration resulting from
the Subsequent Earnout Review shall be made first to the RandM; Parent Note B
and then, to the extent necessary, be settled by payment of cash.   2.04

not sell any of the shares included in the Stock Consideration until six

12-month anniversary date of the Closing Date, Seller may sell an additional
200,000 of such shares; and after the 18-month anniversary date of the

have the right to  re-examine its decision and to elect not to exercise such
option so  long as notice of its election not to exercise is received by
the  Seller at least 24 hours prior to the expiration of the tender offer

transactions contemplated hereby.   9.07 CONSENTS. Prior to or at the
Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents or waivers from third parties necessary to assure that the sale of
the Romaco Stock to Buyer does not result in termination of any of the
Contracts.   9.08 ENVIRONMENTAL. Buyer represents that it has provided
Seller with copies of all of the Phase I environmental reports which Buyer
obtained with respect to the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property.
Buyer understands that such reports recommend that certain additional Phase
II environmental testing be performed at three sites (the "Properties"),
namely: the Owned Real Property in Rheinfelden, Switzerland and in Neuenburg,
Germany and the Leased Real Property in Remschingen, Germany (the "Phase II
Testing"). Prior to December 31, 2001, Buyer, at its expense, shall complete
the Phase II Testing as outlined in the Phase I reports and provide copies of
reports with respect to such Phase II testing to Seller. If the Phase II
Testing reports indicate environmental conditions at the Properties that,
under applicable Laws, are required to be remediated, then Buyer, in
consultation with Seller and its representatives, shall obtain cost estimates
for the remediation that is required. If Seller disputes that remediation is
required or the nature of the remediation or that the cost estimates for the
proposed remediation activities are reasonable, Seller shall be afforded an
opportunity to meet with representatives of Buyer and its environmental
consultants in Monaco and to present information with respect to the same to
Buyer and its environmental consultants. After Seller has been afforded the
opportunity to meet with Buyer and its representatives as set forth in the
preceding sentence, then Buyer and the Companies shall proceed to take
reasonable steps to remediate the environmental conditions at the Properties
to the extent required to bring the Properties in compliance with applicable
Laws. All costs incurred by Buyer or any of the Companies pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be billed to Seller and paid by Seller within 10
days after a bill for the same is received by Seller either (i) if the
Earnout Payment has not yet been paid, then by deducting such amount from the
Earnout Payment as provided in the Earnout Calculation Schedule, with any
balance to be paid in accordance with following clause and (ii) if the
Earnout Payment has been paid, then by Seller wire transferring funds to the
account designated by Buyer in the bill or by advising Buyer in writing that
the amount of the bill should be deducted from the outstanding principal
amount of RandM; Parent Note A or RandM; Parent Note B, or any combination of the
foregoing methods of payment. Nothing herein shall have the effect of waiving
Seller\'s rights to challenge any such bill on the basis that the remediation
was not required under applicable Laws or the remediation costs were not
reasonable. Seller shall also be responsible for complying with the State of
New Jersey\'s property transfer law, known as    -31-  37  the
"Industrial Site Recovery Act," to the extent compliance with the same
is required in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.   9.09
GUARANTEES OF OBLIGATIONS OF NON-CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. At the Closing,
Seller shall deliver RandM; Parent Note A to RandM; Parent in order to
give effect to the Guarantee Pledge. When the guarantee secured by the
Guarantee Pledge is fully released, then RandM; Parent shall deliver the RandM;
Parent Note A to Seller. In the event RandM; Parent or any of its Affiliates
incur any loss as a result of the guarantee secured by the Guarantee Pledge,
then the principal amount of the RandM; Parent Note A may be reduced to the
extent necessary to cover such loss.   SECTION 10. CONDITIONS TO BUYER\'S

of any of the Companies by Buyer.   10.03 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. All

Closing Condition Effect; and (iv) Buyer and RandM; Parent shall have performed
and complied with, in all material respects, all agreements, obligations and
conditions required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
them prior to or at the Closing.   11.02 LITIGATION. No action, suit or
proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be

breach by Seller of any agreement or indemnification obligation  of Seller

1,500,000 (the "MINIMUM AMOUNT") and then  Seller shall be liable for all
Damages in excess of the Minimum Amount,  except that the Minimum Amount

5.01, 5.03, or 5.04 or an indemnification obligation or  agreement made
pursuant to Section 15.   (d) PROCEDURES APPLICABLE TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.
The obligations and liabilities of a member of the Seller Group or of the
Buyer Group to indemnify a member of the other group under Section 13(a) or
(b) with respect to Claims asserted by a person other than a member of the
Buyer Group or the Seller Group shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:   (i) RIGHT OF INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO ASSUME DEFENSE OF CLAIM. 
The party to be indemnified (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give the  other
party (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") prompt notice of any such Claim,  and,
subject to the provisions of Section 13(d)(v), the Indemnifying  Party, at
its sole cost and expense, shall have the right, upon written  notice to the
Indemnified Party that it is assuming defense of the  Claim, to assume the
defense of the Claim while reserving its right to  contest the issue of
whether it is liable to the Indemnified Party for  any indemnity hereunder.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense  of the Claim, it shall select
counsel reasonably acceptable to the  Indemnified Party to conduct the
defense of the Claim and shall defend  or settle the    -36-  42  
same; provided, however, that if it shall later be determined that the 
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification with respect to  the
matter as to which Indemnifying Party has undertaken the defense of  the
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party  for
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and for any amounts  paid in
judgment or settlement prior to such determination.   (ii) CONTROL OF THE
DEFENSE. The contest of the Claim may be  conducted in the name and on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party or the  Indemnified Party, as may be appropriate.
Subject to compliance by the  Indemnifying Party with the other requirements
of this Section  13(d)(ii), such contest shall be conducted diligently by
reputable  counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnifying
Party  shall keep the Indemnified Party fully informed with respect to the 
Claim and the contest thereof. Subject to compliance by the  Indemnifying
Party with the other requirements of this Section  13(d)(ii), if the
Indemnified Party joins in any such contest, the  Indemnifying Party shall
have full authority, in consultation with the  Indemnified Party, to
determine all action to be taken with respect  thereto; provided, however,
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to  a settlement of, or the entry of
any monetary judgment arising from,  the Claim, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party  which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and further  provided that if the Indemnified Party shall fail or
refuse to consent  to a settlement or judgment proposed by the Indemnifying
Party and a  judgment thereafter shall be entered or a settlement shall be
effected  in an amount in excess of the settlement or judgment proposed by
the  Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability 
hereunder with respect to such excess or any expenses or other Damages 
related thereto arising after the date such settlement or judgment is  so
proposed. In no event shall the Indemnifying Party have authority to  agree
to any relief other than the payment of money damages by the  Indemnifying
Party unless agreed to by the Indemnified Party.   (iii) COOPERATION IN
DEFENSE. If requested by the Indemnifying  Party, the Indemnified Party
agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying  Party and its counsel, including
permitting reasonable access to books  and records, in contesting any Claim
which the Indemnifying Party  elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making
any counterclaim  against the person asserting the Claim, or any cross-
complaint against  any person, but the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the
Indemnified  Party for reasonable out-of-pocket costs (but not the cost of
employee  time expended) incurred by the Indemnified Party in so cooperating.
The  Indemnifying Party agrees to use its best efforts to afford the 
Indemnified Party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and  to
participate in, conferences with all persons, including governmental 
authorities, asserting any Claim against the Indemnified Party or 
conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.   (iv)
FAILURE OF INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO ASSUME DEFENSE. If the  Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of the Claim in  accordance with the terms hereof
within 20 days after the receipt of  notice thereof, the Indemnified Party
may, at the    -37-  43   Indemnifying Party\'s expense, defend against
the Claim in such  reasonable manner as it may deem appropriate; provided
that the  Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of the Claim 
without the prior written consent of Indemnifying Party, which shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (v) CLAIMS BELOW THE MINIMUM AMOUNT. The
right to  indemnification pursuant to Section 13(a)(i), Section 13(a)(vi)
and  Section 15(b) does not arise with respect to a Claim until the 
aggregate amount of all Damages alleged in the Claim, together with all 
prior Claims, exceeds the Minimum Amount, except that the party who  would be
the Indemnifying Party if the Minimum Amount had been reached  shall have the
right to participate in, but not control, the defense of  the Claim.   (vi)
COMPLIANCE WITH PROCEDURES. Notwithstanding the terms of  this Section 13,
the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to  indemnification pursuant to
this Section 13 unless the Indemnified  Party (x) delivers the notice
required under Section 13(d)(i) (and in  the case of a representation and
warranty, prior to the expiration of  the representation and warranty in
issue) and (y) permits the  Indemnifying Party to exercise its rights under
Section 13 with respect  to the defense of claims or legal proceedings;
provided, however, that  the failure to comply with the foregoing
requirements under (y) shall  constitute a defense to the indemnity
obligations of the Indemnifying  Party hereunder only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party suffers  actual prejudice as the result of such failure to
comply.   (vii) DAMAGES. When calculating Damages under this Section 13, 
Damages shall be calculated net of any tax benefit or insurance  proceeds
realized by the Indemnified Party as a result of the events  giving rise to
its right to indemnification under this Section 13.   (viii) EXCLUSIVE
NATURE OF INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS. From  and after the Effective Time, the
Buyer Group\'s and the Seller\'s Group  right to indemnification under this
Section 13 shall be their sole and  exclusive right and remedy for recovering
from the other Damages  arising out of, or relating to, claims by third
parties and they shall  not be entitled to pursue, and hereby expressly
waive, any and all  rights that may otherwise be available either at law or
in equity  against the other with respect to Damages arising out of claims
by  third parties.   SECTION 14. TERMINATION.   14.01 TERMINATION OF

breach will be cured on or before the Closing Date;   (c) by Seller, if
there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer or RandM; Parent of any
of the agreements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement,

obligations under this Agreement) if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or prior to September 15, 2001.   14.02 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

14.02 shall continue in full force and effect) and there shall be no
liability on the part of Buyer and RandM; Parent or Seller, except based upon:
(i) a material and willful breach by a party of any of its obligations under
this Agreement or (ii) the obligations set forth in Sections 8, 9.03, 9.06,

with its past  practice on its unaudited consolidated interim balance sheet
as of the  Effective Time and (B) Seller\'s Proportionate Share of any
Taxes  relating to a tax period which began after December 31, 2000 and

income taxes or taxes measured by net income and exceeded any amount  accrued
on the Interim Balance Sheet for such Taxes for such Allocable  Period plus

the account of the Non-Consolidated Subsidiary entitled to the refund

A  ---------     PROCEDURES FOR CALCULATING EARNOUT CONSIDERATION 
------------------------------------------------   The Earnout
Consideration, if any, shall be calculated in accordance with the following
procedures and provisions:   1. The amount of the Earnout Consideration
shall be an amount equal to the sum of the Sales Portion and the EBITDA
Portion less the following: (i) (Euro) 170,000 and (ii) any environmental
remediation costs due Buyer pursuant to Section 9.08 to the extent known on
the date the Earnout Consideration is paid. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, any charges incurred by any of
the Companies for which they are being reimbursed pursuant to clauses (i) or
(ii) of the preceding sentence shall not be an expense for purposes of
calculating the Earnout Consideration.   2. The Sales Portion of the Earnout
Consideration shall be calculated as follows:   A. Determine the excess of
the Sales of the Companies  for the 12 months ended December 31, 2001 over
(Euro)  150,000,000, which amount is referred to as the  "Performance
Sales," provided, however, if  Performance Sales as so determined exceeds
(Euro)  22,000,000, Performance Sales shall be reduced to  (Euro)
22,000,000.   B. The product obtained by multiplying the Performance  Sales
by 0.75 is the "Sales Portion" of the Earnout  Consideration.   3. The
EBITDA Portion of the Earnout Consideration shall be calculated as
follows:   A. Determine the excess of the EBITDA of the Companies  for the
12 months ended December 31, 2001 over (Euro)  12,000,000, which amount is
referred to as the  "Performance EBITDA."   B. The product obtained by
multiplying the Performance  EBITDA by 3.75 is the "EBITDA Portion" of the
Earnout  Consideration.   4. For purposes of this EXHIBIT A:   A. "Sales"
means total sales billed to customers which  are not Affiliates of any of the
Companies after  deducting credits for returned goods, prepaid freight  or
any other similar adjustment to sales and shall be  computed on a basis
consistent with the determination  of sales in connection with Romaco\'s
audited  consolidated statement of income for the year ended  December 31,
2000.   B. "EBITDA" means earnings of the Companies before  interest and
taxes plus depreciation expense and  amortization expense. For purposes of
illustrating  the calculation of EBITDA, if it were determined from 
the     A-1  52   audited consolidated statement of income of Romaco 
for the year ended December 31, 2000, it would be the  result of Sales minus
Cost of Sales, minus Operating  Expenses (Research and Development, Selling
Costs and  General and Administrative Expenses), plus  Depreciation Expense.
In determining EBITDA, Sales,  Cost of Sales, Operating Expenses, and
Depreciation  Expense shall be computed on a basis consistent with  the
determination of such items in connection with  Romaco\'s audited
consolidated statement of income for  the year ended December 31, 2000.  
c. Buyer represents and warrants that it will maintain  the books and records
of the Companies for the period  from the Effective Time to December 31, 2001
in a  manner that will readily allow for the calculation of  Sales and
EBITDA in accordance with the provisions of  this EXHIBIT A.   d. Costs
incurred after May 15, 2001 and included as  expenses of any of the Companies
after May 15, 2001  that are payments to third-parties that were incurred 
by any of the Companies primarily in connection with  due diligence
activities requested by Buyer or RandM;  Parent shall be excluded from expenses
of the  Companies in calculating EBITDA for the period in  which such
expenses were recorded. Such expenses  include (i) travel expenses of Company
personnel,  lodging and meal costs, telephone and fax charges,  and similar
items payable to third parties and (ii)  charges of Ernst and Young directly
related to the such  due diligence activities, including the fees and  costs
associated with any audit of the books and  records of the Companies
performed by Ernst and Young  to prepare a Closing Date audit for RandM;
Parent.   ----------------     A-2  53     EXHIBIT E
