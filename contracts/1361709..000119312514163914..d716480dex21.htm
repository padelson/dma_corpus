ARTICLE II.

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. (a) Subject in each case to Section
2.1(d), Section 2.1(e) and Section 2.1(f), at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (such shares,
collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Share_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled
Shares, Subsidiary Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

(i) _Mixed Election Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive a combination of common units representing
limited partner interests in ETP (" _Common Units_ ") and cash (such election,
a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant
to Section 2.2 (each such share, a " _Mixed Consideration Election Share_ ")
and each No Election Share (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive the combination (which combination
shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Mixed Election Consideration_ ")
of (A) $40.125 in cash without interest (the " _Standard Cash Consideration_
") and (B) 0.7253 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common
Unit (the " _Standard Common Unit Consideration_ ").

(ii) _Cash Election Shares. _ Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive cash (such election, a " _Cash Election_ ")
has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 (each such
share, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive $80.25 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Election Consideration_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Cash Election Amount (as defined
below) exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount (as defined below), then,
instead of being converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of the
Cash Election

 



\- 4 - Consideration, _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction, the " _Cash Fraction_ "), and (B) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Units equal to the product
of the Common Unit Election Consideration, _multiplied by_ a fraction equal
to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

" _Cash Election Amount_ " means the product of the number of Cash Election
Shares _multiplied by_ the Cash Election Consideration.

 

" _Available Cash Election Amount_ " means the difference between (1) the
product of the Standard Cash Consideration  _multiplied by_ the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares, Subsidiary
Shares and Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _minus_ (2) the product of (A) the sum of the number of Mixed
Consideration Election Shares and the number of No Election Shares,
_multiplied by_ and (B) the Standard Cash Consideration.

 

(iii) _Common Unit Election Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive Common Units (such election, a "
_Common Unit Election_ ") is properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section
2.2 (each such share, a " _Common Unit Election Share_ ") shall be converted
into the right to receive 1.4506 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Common Units (such number of Common Units, the " _Common Unit Election
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then, instead of being
converted into the right to receive the Common Unit Election Consideration,
each Common Unit Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive
(A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess
_divided by_ the number of Common Unit Election Shares, and (B) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Units equal to the product
of the Common Unit Election Consideration _multiplied by_ a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the difference between (I) the Cash Election
Consideration _minus_ (II) the amount calculated in clause (A) of this
paragraph, and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election
Consideration.

(b) _Cancelled Shares and Subsidiary Shares_.

 

(i) Each Share that is held directly by the Company in treasury and each Share
that is held directly by ETP or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such Shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(ii) Each Share that is held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
ETP (other than Merger Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (such Shares, the "
_Subsidiary Shares_ ") shall, by

 



\- 5 -  virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted into such number of shares of common stock, of the
Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such
Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and, together with the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation issued in respect of the Subsidiary Shares as set forth
in Section 2.1(b)(ii), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for
all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Fractional Units_. No fractional Common Units shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fractional Common Unit will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), a cash payment in lieu
of such fractional Common Unit representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced
by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in one or more
transactions of Common Units equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number
of Common Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by ETP pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Common Units to be
issued to the holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.3(b) (such excess, the
" _Excess Shares_ "). No certificates or scrip representing fractional Common
Units shall be issued in the Merger. The parties acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Common Units was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to ETP
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Common Units. As
soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to
be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional Common Units, the
Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Shares,
without interest, subject to and in accordance with Section 2.2.

(e) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares of the
Company or outstanding units of ETP shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, stock or unit split (including a reverse stock or unit
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or units, or any
stock or unit dividend or stock or unit distribution with a record date during
such period, the Mixed Election Consideration (including the Standard Cash
Consideration and the Standard Common Unit Consideration), the Cash Election
Consideration and the Common Unit Election Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide to ETP,
Merger Sub and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action, and thereafter, all
references in

 



\- 6 -  this Agreement to the Mixed Election Consideration (including the Standard
Cash Consideration and the Standard Common Unit Consideration), the Cash
Election Consideration and the Common Unit Election Consideration and any
other similarly dependent items shall be references to the Mixed Election
Consideration (including the Standard Cash Consideration and the Standard
Common Unit Consideration), the Cash Election Consideration and the Common
Unit Election Consideration and any other similarly dependent items as so
adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 2.1(e) shall
be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such
change that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant
to this Agreement.

(f) _Dissenters Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders properly exercising
appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be
converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of
the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal
shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration specified in Section 2.1(a)(iii); _ provided_, in such
circumstance, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that Parent shall be
entitled at its sole option to convert each such share into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration specified in either Section 2.1(a)(i) or
2.1(a)(ii). The Company shall give ETP and Merger Sub (i) prompt written
notice of any demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the DGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, voluntarily make or agree to make any material payment
with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company,
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.2 _Election Procedures_. (a) An election form and other appropriate
and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as ETP
shall reasonably specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed no less than thirty (30) days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date or on such other date as ETP and the Company
shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the fifth business day
prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").

 



\- 7 - (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Mixed
Election; (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock
with respect to which such holder makes a Cash Election; and (iii) the number
of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such
holder makes a Common Unit Election. Any Shares with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the twentieth (20th) day following
the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as ETP and the Company shall
agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than Cancelled Shares and
Subsidiary Shares or any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute
Dissenting Shares at such time) shall be deemed to be " _No Election Shares_
," and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have made a
Mixed Election with respect to such No Election Shares.

 

(c) ETP shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be
requested from time to time by all persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the
close of business on the business day prior to the Election Deadline, and the
Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(d) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. After a Mixed Election, Cash Election or a Common Unit
Election is validly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock,
any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common Stock shall
automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting such Election Form, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event
an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Common Stock prior to
the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of ETP, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall
be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election
Form.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Mailing Date, ETP shall appoint an exchange
agent mutually acceptable to ETP and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. Prior to
the Effective Time, (i) ETP shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares
(other than the Cancelled Shares, the Subsidiary Shares, and any Dissenting
Shares), certificates representing the Common Units issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1(a) and Section 5.6(a) (or appropriate alternative arrangements
shall be made by ETP if uncertificated Common Units will be issued) and an
amount of cash sufficient to effect the delivery of the Merger Consideration
to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares,
Subsidiary Shares and any Dissenting Shares). Following the Effective Time,

 



\- 8 -  ETP agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to Section 2.3(c).
All such certificates representing Common Units and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent from time to time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth business day
following the Effective Time, ETP shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of Shares, which at the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and that risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the certificates or book-entry notations
representing Shares (in each case, " _Certificates_ ") in exchange for, as
applicable, cash Merger Consideration, certificates representing whole Common
Units (or book-entry notations, if uncertificated Common Units will be
issued), cash in lieu of any fractional Common Units pursuant to Section
2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, that number of
whole Common Units (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 and payment
by cash or check of that amount of cash Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, that amount of cash in lieu of
fractional Common Units which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.1(d) and any distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c) to
which such holder is entitled, and the Shares represented by the Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any cash payment is to be made
to, or any Common Units constituting any part of the Merger Consideration is
to be registered in the name of, a person other than the person in whose name
the applicable surrendered Share is registered, it shall be a condition to the
payment or registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate be in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment or delivery of
the Merger Consideration pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a
result of such registration in the name of a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or
Section 2.3(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section
2.3(c).

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No distributions with
respect to Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
Common Units represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Common Units shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(d),
until such Certificate has been surrendered in accordance with this Article
II. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i)
promptly after such surrender, (A) the number of whole Common Units (after
taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to which such 

 



\- 9 -  holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, (B) payment by cash or check of
that amount of cash Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1, (C) that amount of cash in lieu of fractional Common
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(d), and (D) the
amount of distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole Common Units and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such whole Common Units.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II and any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(d) or Section 2.3(c) shall be
deemed to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates. After
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to ETP upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
ETP for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional Common Units pursuant to Section 2.1(d) and any distributions
pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by ETP, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as ETP may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Share represented by such
Certificate as contemplated by this Article II.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, the ETP Parties, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. Each of the ETP Parties, Merger Sub and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the
ETP Parties, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made.

representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or in

the execution of this Agreement (the " _ETP Disclosure Schedule_ ") (each
section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation,
warranty or covenant if specified therein and such other representations,

their respective equity holders are necessary to authorize the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has approved the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the ETP Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, the
issuance of Common Units (the " _Unit Issuance_ ") in connection with the
Merger and the Partnership Agreement Amendment. No vote of holders of
securities of ETP, ETE or any ETP Party is required to approve the Merger, the
Unit Issuance or the execution of the Partnership Agreement Amendment, and no
vote of the holders of any class of ETP equity holders is necessary
to approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, the Unit Issuance and the execution of the Partnership Agreement
Amendment, in each case, other than the approval of and action by Parent, and
such approval of and action by Parent has been obtained. Each of the ETP
Transaction Documents has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
ETP Parties, HHI and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, assuming each such ETP
Transaction Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of
the counterparty thereto, each of the ETP Transaction Documents constitutes
the legal, valid and binding agreement of each of the ETP Parties, HHI and
Merger Sub and is enforceable against the ETP Parties, HHI and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms.

outside of the United States and (vii) the approvals set forth in Section
4.3(b) of the ETP Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _ETP Approvals_
"), and, subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company in Section 3.3(b), no authorization, consent, order, license, permit
or approval of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation
by the ETP Parties, HHI or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for such authorizations, consents, orders, licenses,
permits, approvals or filings that are not required to be obtained or made
prior to consummation of such transactions or that, if not obtained or made,
would not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or have, individually or in
the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect.

 



\- 34 - (c) The execution and delivery by the ETP Parties, HHI and Merger Sub of this
Agreement do not, and (assuming the ETP Approvals are obtained) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not (i) result in any loss, or suspension, limitation
or impairment of any right of ETP or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use
any assets required for the conduct their business or result in any violation
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan, guarantee of
indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right
or license binding upon ETP or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the
creation of any Liens other than ETP Permitted Liens, in each case, upon any
of the properties or assets of ETP or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict
with or result in any violation of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or other equivalent organizational document, in each
case as amended or restated, of ETP or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii)
conflict with or violate any applicable Laws, except in the case of clauses
(i) and (iii) for such losses, suspensions, limitations, impairments,
conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations, cancellation, accelerations, or
Liens as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_. (a) ETP and each of its
Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required
to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC since
January 1, 2012 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished by ETP or
any of its Subsidiaries, the " _ETP SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the ETP SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the ETP SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the ETP SEC
Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of ETP included in the ETP SEC Documents fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of ETP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

 



\- 35 - Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. ETP has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. ETPs disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by ETP in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to the management of Parent as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ETPs management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ETPs internal control over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting prior to the date hereof, management of Parent has
disclosed to ETPs auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors
of Parent GP (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect ETPs ability to
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in ETPs
internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness
and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company
prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in ETPs consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 (the "
_ETP Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the ETP
SEC Documents, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (c) for liabilities and obligations incurred
since the ETP Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business and (d)
for liabilities and obligations that have been discharged or paid in full,
neither ETP nor any Subsidiary of ETP has any liabilities or obligations of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of ETP and
its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), other than those
which would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material
Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Law; Permits_. (a) ETP and its Subsidiaries are

any written notice or, to ETPs knowledge, other communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure
to comply with, any Law, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect.

(b) ETP and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals, clearances, permissions, qualifications and
registrations and orders of all applicable Governmental Entities, and all

have filed all tariffs, reports, notices and other documents with all
Governmental

 



\- 36 -  Entities necessary for ETP and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
their properties and assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now
being conducted (the " _ETP Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any
of the ETP Permits or to have filed such tariffs, reports, notices or other
documents would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material
Adverse Effect. All ETP Permits are valid and in full force and effect and
are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that could result
in modification, termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure
to be in full force and effect or any modification, termination, or
revocation thereof would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP
Material Adverse Effect. ETP is, and each of its Subsidiaries is, in
compliance in all respects with the terms and requirements of such ETP
Permits, except where the failure to be in compliance would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect.

contributed to by ETP, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their ERISA

3(37) of ERISA), and (iii) neither ETP, its Subsidiaries nor any of
their ERISA Affiliates has during the past six years maintained or

their respective properties and (c) there are no orders, judgments or decrees
of, or before, any Governmental Entity against ETP or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.12 _Information Supplied_. None of the information provided in
writing by ETP or its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

Section 4.13 _Tax Matters_. Except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect:

(a) ETP and its Subsidiaries (i) have duly and timely filed (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file) all Tax Returns required
to have been filed by or with respect to ETP or any of its Subsidiaries, and
all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete, (ii) have duly and timely
paid all Taxes due and payable (whether or not shown on such Tax Returns),
(iii) withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in

written notice of any deficiencies for any Tax from any taxing authority

matters contested in good faith or for which adequate reserves, in accordance

have adequate reserves, in accordance with GAAP, on the financial statements
included in the ETP SEC Documents for Taxes payable by ETP and
its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of the most recent quarterly or annual report included in the ETP SEC

included in the ETP SEC Documents, neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries
have incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business
or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

 

(b) Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any currently

delinquent, being contested in good faith or for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established, in accordance with GAAP, in the ETP SEC
Documents. No claim has been made in writing in the past three years by
a taxing authority of a jurisdiction where ETP or one of its Subsidiaries has
not filed Tax Returns claiming that ETP or such Subsidiary is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

(c) Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is obligated by any written
contract or agreement to indemnify any other person (other than ETP and its
Subsidiaries) with respect to Taxes (excluding customary Tax indemnification
provisions in commercial Contracts not primarily relating to Taxes). Neither
ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any written Tax
allocation, indemnification or sharing agreement (other than an agreement
solely between or among ETP and/or its Subsidiaries and excluding customary
Tax indemnification provisions in commercial Contracts not primarily relating
to Taxes). Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of the Tax Laws of any
state, local or foreign jurisdiction) or as a transferee or successor for any
Tax of any person other than ETP and its Subsidiaries.

 



\- 39 - (d) Neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries was a "distributing corporation"
or "controlled corporation" in a transaction intended to qualify under

transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(f) ETP has, at all times since its formation, been classified for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the
case may be, and not as a corporation. ETP is not, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, a partnership that would be treated as an investment company (within
the meaning of Section 351) if the partnership were incorporated.

Section 4.14 _Insurance_. ETP and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance in such
amounts and against such risks substantially as ETP believes to be customary
for the industries in which it and its Subsidiaries operate. Except as would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP Material Adverse Effect,
neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any pending
or, to the knowledge of ETP, threatened cancellation or premium increase
(retroactive or otherwise) with respect to any such insurance policy, and each
of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all conditions contained therein.

Section 4.15 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors of Parent
GP has received the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated to the
effect that, as of the date thereof and subject to the assumptions,
limitations, qualifications and other matters considered in the preparation
thereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to
ETP.

Section 4.16 _Material Contracts_. (a) Except for this Agreement, the ETP
Benefit Plans and agreements filed as exhibits to ETP SEC Documents, as of
the date of this Agreement, neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to or bound by:

 

(i) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC);

 

(ii) any mortgage, note, debenture, indenture, security agreement, guaranty,
pledge or other agreement or instrument evidencing indebtedness for borrowed
money or any guarantee of such indebtedness of the ETP or any of its
Subsidiaries in an amount in excess of $100 million;

 

(iii) any Contract expressly limiting or restricting the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make distributions or declare or pay
dividends in respect of their capital stock, partnership interests, membership
interests or other equity interests, as the case may be; and

 



\- 40 - (iv) any acquisition Contract that contains "earn out" or other contingent
payment obligations, or remaining indemnity or similar obligations, that could
reasonably be expected to result in payments after the date hereof by ETP or
any of its Subsidiaries in excess of $100 million.

 

All contracts of the types referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) above are
referred to herein as " _ETP Material Contracts_."

(b) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an ETP
Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither ETP nor any Subsidiary of ETP is in
breach of or default under the terms of any ETP Material Contract, (ii) to the
knowledge of ETP, no other party to any ETP Material Contract is in breach of
or default under the terms of any ETP Material Contract and (iii) each ETP
Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of ETP or the Subsidiary
of ETP which is party thereto and, to the knowledge of ETP, of each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect, subject to the
Remedies Exceptions.

Section 4.17 _Finders or Brokers_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, neither
the ETP Parties nor any of ETPs Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement who would be entitled to any fee or any commission in
connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.

Section 4.18 _Lack of Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither ETP nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any "affiliate" or "associate" of ETP or any of its
Subsidiaries (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)
beneficially owns (or has beneficially owned in the past three years)
directly or indirectly, any Shares or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares or any securities of any Subsidiary
of the Company (including for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL), and
neither ETP nor any of its Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any Shares
except pursuant to this Agreement. Except for the Support Agreements, there
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which ETP or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital
stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 4.19 _Financing_. Assuming the satisfaction of the closing conditions
set forth in Section 6.3 and the accuracy of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.2, then, as of the Closing, ETP and Merger
Sub will have, immediately available to them cash and funds to consummate the

Agreement, including the payment of the full Merger Consideration and the
consideration in respect of the Company Stock Awards and other equity-
based awards under Section 5.6 and to fund any required refinancings or
repayments of any existing indebtedness of ETP, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that may be required as a result of the Merger and to pay all
related fees and expenses of ETP and its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.20 _No Additional Representations_. (a) The ETP Parties, HHI and
Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company does not make any representation or
warranty as to any matter whatsoever except as expressly set forth in Article
III or in any certificate delivered

 



\- 41 -  by the Company to the ETP Parties, HHI or Merger Sub in accordance with the

foregoing) that the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect
to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered or made available to

condition (or any component thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(b) the future business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and none of the ETP Parties, HHI or Merger Sub has relied on
such information or any other representations or warranties not set forth in
Article III.

 

(b) The ETP Parties, HHI and Merger Sub have conducted their own independent

or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives)
that relate to any Acquisition Proposal.

to make, withhold, withdraw, amend, change, qualify or modify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, change, qualify or modify, the Company

Recommendation, whether or not in accordance with Section 5.4(e) or Section
5.4(f), shall change the approval of this Agreement for purposes of Section
251 of the DGCL, and no Change of Recommendation shall have the effect of
causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other

to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may at any
time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, make a Change of
Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h), if
(and only if): (i) (A) a written, Acquisition Proposal (that (x) did not

Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer and (C) following consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company determines that

pursuant to Section 7.1(h) would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach
by the Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and
(ii) (A) the Company provides ETP seventy-two (72) hours prior written notice
of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include the
information with respect to such Superior Offer that is specified in Section
5.4(b), (B) after

 



\- 52 -  providing such notice and prior to making such Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Offer or taking any action pursuant to Section
7.1(h) with respect to a Superior Offer, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with ETP during such seventy-two (72) hour period (to the extent that
ETP desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement, such that the Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Offer, and (C) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in
good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by ETP, and
following such seventy-two (72) hour period, shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a
Superior Offer if such changes offered in writing by ETP were to be given
effect; _provided_  that, in the event that the Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall provide written notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall
again comply with this Section 5.4(e).

(f) Other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall be subject to
Section 5.4(e) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.4(f)), nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the
Company from making a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event to the extent that (i) the Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (ii) (A) the Company provides ETP seventy-two (72) hours
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify the reasons therefor, (B) after providing such notice and prior to
making such Change of Recommendation, the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with ETP during such seventy-two (72) hour period (to the extent that
ETP desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this
Agreement as would not permit the Board of Directors to make a Change of
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 5.4(f), and (C) the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement offered in writing by ETP, and following such seventy-two (72)
hour period, shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law would continue to require a Change of
Recommendation with respect to an Intervening Event.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, with
respect to Susser MLP and its Subsidiaries, the Companys obligations under
this Section 5.4 to take an action or not to take an action shall only apply
to the extent permitted by the organizational documents of Susser MLP and its
Subsidiaries and to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, Susser MLP or the Board of Directors of the
Company or the Board of Directors of Susser MLP GP from taking and disclosing
to its equityholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure
that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Board of Directors of the Company with respect to this
Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Company in connection
with such communication publicly states that its recommendation with respect
to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company.

Section 5.5  _Filings; Other Actions_. (a) As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, ETP and the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, which will include the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each of ETP and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act. ETP shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state or provincial securities laws in connection with the
issuance and reservation of Common Units in the Merger, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be

 



\- 55 -  reasonably requested in connection with any such action. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be made by ETP or the Company, as applicable, without the others prior
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and
without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. ETP or the Company, as applicable, will advise the other
promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Common
Units issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any
state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to ETP or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by ETP or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders, to be held as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, to consider
the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company
will, except in the case of a Change of Recommendation, (i) through its Board
of Directors, recommend that its stockholders adopt this Agreement and (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other action reasonably
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain
such approvals. In the case of a Change of Recommendation, the Company will
continue to request and accept proxies from its stockholders, whether for or
against the adoption of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, no Change of
Recommendation shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligations set
forth in this Section 5.5, other than the Companys obligation set forth in
the second sentence of this Section 5.5(b).

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may, in consultation with ETP, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, (ii) for the absence of quorum, (iii) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure which the Company has determined after consultation with
outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and
(iv) if the Company has delivered any notice contemplated by Section 5.4(e) or
5.4(f) and the time periods contemplated by the Section under which such
notice has been delivered have not expired.

 



\- 56 - Section 5.6 _Equity-Based Awards_. (a) Each option to purchase Shares (other
than an option granted pursuant to the Company ESPP) (each, a " _Company
Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested
and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any,
of the Equity Award Consideration over the exercise price per Share subject
to such Company Option. The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Company Options the cash amounts
described in the immediately preceding sentence, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment, within
five business days following the Effective Time.

 

(b) Each award of restricted stock units (other than 2014 LTIP Units) that
corresponds to Shares and that is outstanding as of the date hereof (each, a
" _Company RSU Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is also outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the Effective Time,
become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of restricted stock units
subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming the satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria at 100% of
target level) multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Consideration. The
Surviving Corporation shall pay to the holders of Company RSU Awards the cash
amounts described in the immediately preceding sentence (together with any
dividend equivalents corresponding to Company RSU Awards that vest in
accordance with this Section 5.6(b)), less such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payments, within five
business days following the Effective Time.

(c) Each award of restricted Shares that is outstanding as of the date hereof
that is also outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the " _Restricted Shares_ " and, together with the Company Options and
Company RSU Awards, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and each
share of Company Common Stock subject to such grant of Restricted Shares shall
be converted into cash, Common Units or a combination of cash and Common
Units in accordance with Section 2.1, depending on whether the holder of such
Restricted Shares makes a Mixed Election, Cash Election or a Common Unit
Election and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 2.1. Unless the
holder of such Restricted Shares shall have remitted to the Company the amount
required to be withheld with respect to the vesting and lapse of restrictions
on the Restricted Shares under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, the consideration to be received by such holder pursuant to
Section 2.1 shall be reduced by the amount required to be deducted

 



\- 57 -  and withheld with respect to the vesting and lapse of such restrictions on
the Restricted Shares. Such reduction shall come first from the cash portion
of the consideration payable to the holder of the Restricted Shares under
Section 2.1, if any, and if there is no cash portion of such consideration or
if the cash portion is not sufficient to satisfy the amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to vesting and lapse of such restrictions
on the Restricted Shares, then the number of Common Units to be received by
the holder of such Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be reduced
by a number of Common Units (rounded up to the nearest whole unit with cash
payable in respect of the resulting fractional unit) equal to (i) the amount
(or additional amount, as the case may be) required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the vesting and lapse of such restrictions on the
Restricted Shares divided by (ii) the closing price of one Common Unit on the
New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to the Closing Date, as reflected in
the _Wall Street Journal_.

 

(d) Each award of restricted Shares that is granted under the Companys 2013
Equity Incentive Plan (the " _Company 2013 EIP_ ") after the date hereof as
permitted under Section 5.1(b) and that remains outstanding and unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Post-Signing Restricted
Share_ ") shall be converted as of the Effective Time into (i) a restricted
unit award (an " _Adjusted Restricted Unit_ "), with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Post-Signing Restricted Share
immediately prior to the Effective Time, covering the number of Common Units,
rounded down to the nearest whole Common Unit, determined by multiplying the
number of Shares subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria at 100% of
target level) by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (ii) cash in lieu of any
fractional Adjusted Restricted Unit lost to such rounding in the amount set
forth in Section 2.1(d), which cash shall be payable as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five business days)
following the Effective Time ( _provided_ , _however_ , (A) in the event that
such cash payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Post-Signing Restricted Share, the
payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the Company 2013 EIP
and related award document and (B) the Adjusted Restricted Unit shall vest
without regard to the satisfaction of any performance criteria in accordance
with the terms set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule).

 

(e) Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to Shares that is
granted under the Company 2013 EIP after the date hereof as permitted under
Section 5.1(b) and that remains outstanding or payable as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Post-Signing Restricted Unit_ ") shall be
converted as of the Effective Time into (i) a phantom unit award (an "
_Adjusted Phantom Unit_ "), with the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to such Post-Signing Restricted Unit immediately prior to the
Effective Time, covering the number of Common Units, rounded down to
the nearest whole Common Unit, determined by multiplying the number of Shares
subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming
satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria at 100% of target level)
by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional
Adjusted Phantom Unit lost to such rounding in the amount set forth in Section
2.1(d), which cash shall be payable as soon as reasonably practicable (but in
no event later than five business days) following the Effective Time (
_provided_ , _however_ , (A) in the event that such cash payment would cause
any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with
respect to a Post-Signing Restricted Unit, the payment shall instead be made
at the time specified in the Company 2013 EIP and related award document and
(B) the Adjusted Phantom Unit shall vest in accordance with the terms set
forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



\- 58 - (f) Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to Shares that were
granted under the Company 2013 EIP in 2014 prior to the date of this
Agreement and that are specified on Section 5.6(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each, a " _2014 LTIP Unit_ ") shall be converted as of the Effective
Time into (i) an Adjusted Phantom Unit, with the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such 2014 LTIP Unit immediately prior to the Effective
Time, covering the number of Common Units, rounded down to the nearest whole
Common Unit, determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such
2014 LTIP Unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming
satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria at 100% of target level)
by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional
Adjusted Phantom Unit lost to such rounding in the amount set forth in Section
2.1(d), which cash shall be payable as soon as reasonably practicable (but in
no event later than five business days) following the Effective Time (
_provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such cash payment would cause any
additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with
respect to a 2014 LTIP Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the time
specified in the Company 2013 EIP). Such Adjusted Phantom Unit shall vest on
January 2, 2015, _provided_ that the holder thereof remains in continuous
employment by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries through such date
(or, if earlier, to the extent provided in a grantees employment agreement or
the applicable 2014 LTIP Unit award agreement, upon the grantees termination
of employment by the Surviving Corporation without "cause" or resignation for
"good reason" or due to a "constructive termination" prior to such date) and
shall be settled by the delivery of Common Units (net of applicable tax
withholdings, which may be effected through the withholding of Common Units
if elected by the grantee) on January 2, 2015 (or, if earlier, promptly
following vesting).

(g) The then-current offering period under the Susser Holdings Corporation
2008 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, with each participant in the Company
ESPP at such time being entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an
amount, in cash, equal to the product of (i) the Equity Award Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares such participant would have been able
to purchase with the balance of his or her payroll account under the Company
ESPP if the Closing Date had been the applicable "purchase date" under the
Company ESPP for the then-current offering period, less such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payments, within
five business days following the Effective Time. Each participant in the
Company ESPP described in the preceding sentence shall have no further rights
or benefits under the Company ESPP other than as described in the preceding
sentence.

(h) For purposes of this Section 5.6, (i) " _Equity Award Consideration_ "
means the closing price of one Share on the New York Stock Exchange on the
trading day prior to the Closing Date, as reflected in the _Wall Street
Journal_ , and (ii) " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ " means the number equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Equity Award Consideration by (B)
the closing price of one Common Unit on the New York Stock Exchange on
the trading day prior to the Closing Date, as reflected in the _Wall Street
Journal._

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, adopting any necessary amendments or
obtaining any required consents) to effectuate the treatment of the Company
Equity Awards, Post-Signing 

 



\- 59 -  Restricted Shares, Post-Signing Restricted Units, 2014 LTIP Units and awards
pursuant to the Company ESPP contemplated by this Section 5.6 and to ensure
that neither any holder of a Company Equity Award, a Post-Signing Restricted
Share, a Post-Signing Restricted Unit or a 2014 LTIP Unit nor any other
participant in any equity plan maintained by the Company or the Company ESPP
shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to
any award previously granted under any Company equity plan or the Company
ESPP.

 

(j) ETP shall take all actions reasonably necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of Common Units for delivery upon issuance of the Adjusted
Restricted Units and settlement of the Adjusted Phantom Units in accordance
with this Section 5.6. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, ETP shall file a registration statement on an appropriate form, or
a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under
the Securities Act, with respect to the Common Units subject to Adjusted
Restricted Units and Adjusted Phantom Units and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Adjusted Restricted Units and/or Adjusted Phantom
Units remain outstanding.

 

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_. (a) From and after the Effective Time, subject
to Section 5.6(f), ETP shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor all Company Benefit Plans and
compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time as such agreements
and arrangements may be modified or terminated in accordance with their terms
from time to time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of
its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the first anniversary thereof, to provide to each of the individuals
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") (i) base compensation and target
cash bonus opportunity that, in each case, is no less favorable than was
provided to the Current Employee immediately before the Effective Time, and
(ii) all other compensation and benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the compensation and benefits (A) provided to such Current
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity-based
compensation), or (B) provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and
its Subsidiaries (excluding equity-based compensation). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (x) ETP shall or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each Current Employee whose
employment terminates during the one-year period following the Effective Time
(or such longer period required by an applicable Company Benefit Plan) under
circumstances that would cause such Current Employee to receive severance
payments and benefits under an applicable Company Benefit Plan with severance
payments and benefits at levels and in amounts no less favorable than the
levels and amounts in effect under the applicable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) during such one-year period
following the Effective Time (or such longer period required by an Company
Benefit Plan), severance benefits offered to each Current Employee shall be
determined without taking into account any reduction after the Effective Time
in compensation paid to such Current Employee.

 



\- 60 - (b) For all purposes (including vesting and eligibility to participate and
level of benefits but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans of ETP and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Current Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Current Employee shall be credited with his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Current Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service for such purpose under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such
Current Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Current Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Benefit Plan in which such Current Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "),
and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Current Employee, ETP shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless and to the extent the
individual, immediately prior to entry in the New Plans, was subject to such
conditions under the comparable Old Plans, and ETP shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Benefit Plans_ " means,
with respect to any entity, any compensation or employee benefit plans,
programs, policies, agreements or other arrangements, whether or not "employee
benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")), whether or not
subject to ERISA, including bonus, cash or equity-based incentive, deferred
compensation, equity purchase, health, medical, dental, disability, accident,
life insurance, or vacation, paid time off, perquisite, fringe benefit,
severance, change of control, retention, employment, separation, retirement,
pension, or savings, plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements for
the benefit of current or former directors, officers or employees of such
entity or any of its Subsidiaries or any dependent or beneficiary thereof.

(c) ETP hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable.

 

(d) If requested by ETP, subject to the terms of any such Company Benefit Plan
and applicable Law, the Company shall both (i) terminate any Company Benefit
Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code Section
401(k) cash or deferred arrangement (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii)
fully vest each Current Employee in his or her account balance in such
Company 401(k) Plan, in each case, effective at least one day prior to the
Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective Date_ "). Prior to the ERISA Effective
Date, the

 



\- 61 -  Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of the Companys or,
as applicable, its Subsidiarys Board of Directors authorizing such
termination and amending any such Company 401(k) Plan commensurate with its
termination to the extent necessary to comply with all applicable Laws. The
Company shall also take and/or cause its Subsidiaries to take such other
actions in furtherance of the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan as
Parent may reasonably require, including such actions as Parent may require
prior to the Effective Time to support Parent obtaining a determination letter
with respect to the termination of each Company 401(k) Plan following the
ERISA Effective Date. In addition, unless otherwise determined by Parent, the
Company shall take such actions as may be necessary to eliminate, as of no
later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, from any Company 401(k)
Plan, any investment fund, election or alternative that provides for an
investment directly or indirectly in shares of Company Common Stock or that
provides for payments to be made to a participant by reference to the value of
Company Common Stock.

 

(e) In the event of the termination, pursuant to Section 5.7(d), of any
Company 401(k) Plan (each such terminated Company 401(k) Plan, a "
_Terminated Company 401(k) Plan_ "), Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall
cause a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code, that includes a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of
Section 401(k) of the Code and that is established or maintained by Parent or
its applicable Subsidiary (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to immediately accept
eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to such individuals account balances (including loans) under such
Terminated Company 401(k) Plan, if elected by any such individuals. The
rollovers described herein shall comply with applicable Law, and Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall make all filings and take any actions required of such
party under applicable Law in connection therewith. Current and former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are participants in a
Terminated Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be eligible immediately as of the Effective Time to participate in a Parent
401(k) Plan.

 

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be construed as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any Benefit Plan or to prevent the amendment or
termination of any Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. Nothing in this
Section 5.7 shall limit the right of ETP, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee
at any time, subject to any rights to severance or other separation benefits
accrued as of the applicable termination date under a Company Benefit Plan.
Without limiting the generality of Section 8.13, the provisions of
this Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no current or former director, officer, employee, other service provider
or independent contractor or any other person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation or benefit plan or
arrangement (including any Benefit Plan of the ETP Parties or their
Subsidiaries) for any purpose.

 

(g) No later than the ERISA Effective Date, the Company shall cause the
Company ESPP to be terminated effective as of the Effective Time. On
or before the ERISA Effective Date, the Company shall provide Parent with
executed resolutions of the Companys Board of Directors authorizing such
termination.

 



\- 62 - (h) Each Current Employee who participates in the Companys employee bonus
plan shall be eligible to receive a pro-rata cash bonus in respect of the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs based on performance at 100%
of target level, for the portion of the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs commencing January 1 through and including the date on which the
Effective Time occurs (the " _Pro Rata Bonus_ "). Payment of the Pro Rata
Bonus shall be subject to the Current Employee remaining employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for 90 days following the Effective Time
(or, if earlier, until March 15 of the year following the year in which the
Effective Time occurs), and shall be payable on the payroll date next-
following 90 days after the Effective Time (but in no event later than March
15 of the year following the year in which the Effective Time occurs);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a Current Employees employment is terminated
by the Company or a Subsidiary without "cause" (as reasonably determined by
the Company) or by the Current Employee for "good reason" (which, for this
purpose shall mean (a) a reduction in the Current Employees base compensation
or (b) a relocation of such Current Employees principal place of employment
by more than 50 miles) prior to the scheduled payment date, the Pro Rata Bonus
shall be paid to the Current Employee promptly following his or her
termination of employment (and in no event later than March 15 of the year
following the year in which the Effective Time occurs). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Current Employee who is bonus-eligible shall be eligible (subject
to applicable employment and performance conditions) to receive a bonus for
the period from the Effective Time through December 31 of the year in which
the Effective Time occurs equal to the total bonus otherwise payable to such
Current Employee for the year in which the Effective Date occurs less the Pro
Rata Bonus paid to such Current Employee.

Section 5.8 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts (subject
to, and in accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken,
promptly all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, promptly and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (i)
obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals, including the Company Approvals and the ETP Approvals, from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,
notifications and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii)
obtaining all necessary consents, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, approvals or waivers from third parties other than any Governmental
Entity, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable, (iii) defending
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,

contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed, and (iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any litigation, administrative or judicial action or other
proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger or any of the proposed
transactions, each of the Company, ETP and Merger Sub shall cooperate with
each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



\- 63 - (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and the ETP Parties shall (i) as promptly as
practicable (and in any event not more than fifteen business days) after the
date hereof, make their respective filings and thereafter make any other
required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained
from, any third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (B) timely making all such filings and
timely seeking all such consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (C)
assuring that all such filings are in material compliance with the
requirements of applicable Regulatory Laws, and (D) making available to the
other party such information as the other party may reasonably request in
order to respond to information requests by any relevant Governmental Entity,
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things advisable to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion
of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications, filings or
correspondence (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between the
Company or the ETP Parties, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity (or members of their respective
staffs) with respect to such transactions. Prior to transmitting any material
to any Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs), the
Company and the ETP Parties shall permit counsel for the other parties a
reasonable opportunity to review and provide comments thereon, and consider in
good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any proposed
written communication to any Governmental Entity (or members of their
respective staffs) to the extent permitted by Law. Each of the Company and the
ETP Parties agrees not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the ETP
Parties, HHI, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their best efforts to
satisfy the conditions to closing identified in Section 6.1 of this Agreement,
including (i) responding to and complying with, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, any request for information or documentary material
regarding the transactions from any relevant Governmental Entity (including
responding to any "second request" for additional information or documentary
material under the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable); (ii)
ensuring the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
and clearance or approval by any such relevant Governmental Entity, including
defense against, and the resolution of, any objections or challenges, in
court or otherwise, by any relevant Governmental Entity preventing
consummation of the transactions; and (iii) assisting and cooperating with the
other party in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective the transactions, under any applicable Regulatory Law with
each relevant Governmental Entity.

 



\- 64 - (d) The ETP Parties agree to take, or cause to be taken (including by their
Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and
all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Entity may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur no
later than the End Date, including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the ETP Parties or the Company (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries), (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
the ETP Parties or their respective Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or
committing to take any action that after the Closing would limit the ETP
Parties freedom of action with respect to, or their ability to retain or
hold, one or more of their or their Subsidiaries (including the Companys or
its Subsidiaries) businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties, in each case as may be required in order to obtain all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations or to avoid
the commencement of any action to prohibit the Merger, or, in the alternative,
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any action or proceeding
seeking to prohibit the Merger or delay the Closing beyond the End Date;
_provided_ that any sale, divestiture or disposition of any material
businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may, at the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.

(e) The ETP Parties and the Company shall not take, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries not to take, any action with the intention to,
or that could reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the obtaining of
clearance or any necessary consent of any Governmental Entity under any
Regulatory Law or the expiration of the required waiting period under any
Regulatory Law.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) so long as such party
has, prior to such termination, complied in all respects with its obligations
under this Agreement, including this Section 5.8.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act of
1890, as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended, the Robinson-
Patman Act, as amended, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the HSR
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, and other regulatory laws and all
other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws, including any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i)
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization, restraint of trade, price discrimination or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition or (ii) protect the national
security or the national economy of any nation.

 



\- 65 - Section 5.9 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions"
or "business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and ETP shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Except (a) following any Change of
Recommendation or (b) with respect to action taken by the Company or its
Board of Directors pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.4, so long
as this Agreement is in effect, ETP and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent
they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent with
such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each party shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Merger and, subject
to the requirements of applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange,
shall not issue any such press release or public statement prior to such
consultation. The ETP Parties and the Company agree to issue a mutually
acceptable initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) ETP and Merger Sub agree
that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in
favor of the current or former, directors, officers or employees, as the case
may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective
articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in
any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. For a period of six years from the Effective Time, ETP and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect any and all
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and any of its Subsidiaries articles of incorporation and by-laws
or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving
Corporations articles of incorporation and bylaws in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, ETP shall assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and
honor, guaranty and stand surety for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in accordance with
their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 5.11
without limit as to time.

 



\- 66 - (b) ETP and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly and severally, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
(and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current and
former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and each person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
consistent with the Company Organizational Documents to repay such amounts if
it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as
such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other
fiduciary of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company). In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, ETP shall cause to be
maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or arising on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_
, that ETP shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained
pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. If the Company in its sole discretion
elects, then the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail
policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such;
_provided_  that in no event shall the cost of such policy exceed six (6)
times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, ETP shall
have no further obligations under this Section 5.11(c).

 

(d) ETP shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.11.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any
other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

 



\- 67 - (f) In the event ETP, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of ETP or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
such party set forth in this Section 5.11. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
Section 5.11 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies.

 

(g) The obligations of ETP and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
5.11 shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and
legal representatives) to whom this Section 5.11 applies without the consent
of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, (i) the
Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 5.11 applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.11, and (ii) this Section 5.11 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified
Parties and their respective successors, heirs and legal representatives
against ETP and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the ETP Parties or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and the ETP Parties shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its operations.

 

Section 5.13 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a liability
of stockholders of the Company.

Section 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, ETP and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Common Units (including
derivative securities with respect to Common Units) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements
with respect to ETP, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



\- 68 - Section 5.15 _Federal Income Tax Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement
intend (a) that the exchange of Company Common Stock for Common Units
pursuant to the Merger qualify as an exchange to which Section 721(a) of the
Code applies and (b) that the distribution in the Post-Closing Transactions by
ETP Holdco Corporation of the Susser MLP IDRs and the limited liability
company interests in Susser MLP GP be treated as a dividend (and not a taxable
disposition of any Surviving Corporation stock) and agree to file all federal
(and, to the extent applicable, state and local) income Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with such qualification and treatment.

Section 5.16 _NYSE Listing_. ETP shall cause the Common Units to be issued in
the Merger and such other Common Units to be reserved for issuance in
connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.17 _Financing Assistance_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with any
financing by Parent, ETP or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger or otherwise, in each case as may be reasonably requested by
ETP, Merger Sub or their Representatives. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, upon reasonable request (i) furnish the report
of the Companys auditor on the most recently available audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of
such report, including in documents filed with the SEC under the Securities
Act, in accordance with normal custom and practice and use reasonable best
efforts to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters to the
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in
connection with any such financing; (ii) furnish any additional financial
statements, schedules, business or other financial data readily available and
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by ETP,
Merger Sub or their Representatives as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate any such financing; (iii) provide reasonable direct contact between
(x) senior management and advisors, including auditors, of the Company and
(y) the proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents, as applicable, and/or Parent or ETPs auditors, as applicable, in

advance notice; (iv) make available senior management of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide reasonable assistance with Parents or ETPs or their
respective Subsidiaries preparation of business projections, financing
documents, pro forma financial information, pro forma financial statements and
offer materials; (v) obtain the cooperation and assistance of counsel to the
Company and its Subsidiaries in providing customary legal opinions and
other services; (vi) provide information, documents, authorization letters,
opinions and certificates, enter into agreements (including indentures or
supplemental indentures) and take other actions that are or may be customary
in connection with the financing or necessary or desirable to permit Parent
or ETP or their respective Subsidiaries to fulfill conditions or obligations
under the financing documents, _provided_ that such agreements entered into
shall be conditioned upon, and shall not take effect until, the Effective
Time; (vii) assist in the preparation of one or more confidential information
memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other marketing and
syndication materials reasonably requested by ETP; (viii) permit Parents or
ETPs or their respective Subsidiaries reasonable use of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries logos for syndication and underwriting, as applicable, in
connection with any such financing (subject to advance review of and
consultation with respect to such use),

 



\- 69 -  (ix) participate in a reasonable number of meetings and presentations with
prospective lenders and investors, as applicable (including the participation
in such meetings of the Companys senior management) and (x) use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in procuring any necessary rating agency ratings
or approvals.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.17 to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.17, (i) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any other liability in
connection with any financing prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (iii) ETP shall, promptly upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-
of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with such cooperation. ETP shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all losses or damages
actually suffered or incurred by them directly in connection with the
arrangement of any such financing (other than to the extent related to
information provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives).

 

(c) Upon the reasonable request of ETP, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to amend the Susser MLP Credit Agreement prior to the
Closing Date to permit the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, shall consult with the ETP Parties on the terms of such amendment and
shall reasonably cooperate to implement any additional amendments to the
Susser MLP Credit Agreement that may be deemed reasonably necessary or
beneficial by the ETP Parties; it being understood that the execution of an
amendment to the Susser MLP Credit Agreement shall not be a condition to any
partys obligation to effect the Merger. " _Susser MLP Credit Agreement_ "
means, collectively, (a) the Revolving Credit Agreement among Susser MLP, as
borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America,
N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, dated
September 25, 2012 (the " _Susser MLP Revolving Credit Agreement_ "), and (b)
the Term Loan and Security Agreement between Susser MLP, as Borrower, and Bank

and as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date,

of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date, except where

satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys willful or intentional

ARTICLE VII.

 

 _TERMINATION_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval (except as provided in Section 7.1(g) or 7.1(h)):

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and ETP;

 

(b) by either the Company or ETP, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or prior to November 30, 2014 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing, other than the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c), shall have been
satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, the End Date
may be extended by either ETP or the Company from time to time by written
notice to the other party up to a date not beyond January 31, 2015, the latest
of any of which dates shall thereafter be deemed to be the End Date; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to a party if (i) the failure of
the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the material breach by such
party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such
party set forth in this Agreement and (ii) the other party has filed (and is
then pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted by Section
8.5;

(c) by either the Company or ETP, if an injunction shall have been entered
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Merger and such injunction shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to a party if such injunction was due
to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement;

 



\- 73 - (d) by either the Company or ETP, if the Stockholders Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Company
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained;

 

(e) by the Company, if ETP or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it
occurred or was continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) and (ii)
by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or
failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, ETP does not cure such
breach or failure within 30 days after receiving written notice from the
Company describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail ( _provided_
that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein);

 

(f) by ETP, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred or was
continuing to occur on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) and (ii) by its
nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such breach or failure is
capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company does not cure such breach
or failure within 30 day after receiving written notice from ETP
describing such breach or failure in reasonable detail ( _provided_ that ETP
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein);

 

(g) by ETP, prior to the Company Stockholder Approval (i) in the event of a
Change of Recommendation, whether or not permitted by Section 5.4, or (ii) if
the Company shall have willfully or intentionally breached any of its
obligations under Section 5.4 or Section 5.5, other than in the case where (A)
such willful or intentional breach is a result of an isolated action by a
person that is a Representative of the Company (other than a director or
senior officer of the Company), (B) such willful or intentional breach was not
caused by, or within the actual knowledge of, the Company, (C) the Company
takes reasonably appropriate actions to remedy such willful or intentional
breach reasonably promptly upon discovery thereof and (D) ETP is not
significantly harmed as a result thereof; and

 

(h) by the Company, prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and if
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
Section 5.4 (except for the obligations under Section 5.4(e), with which the
Company shall have complied in all respects), in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer (which definitive
agreement shall be entered into concurrently with, or promptly following, the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h)); _provided_
that any such purported termination by the Company pursuant to this Section

the Breakup Fee in accordance with Section 7.3(a).

 



\- 74 - Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall terminate (except for

except as provided in Section 7.3 and, subject to Section 7.3(g), liability
arising out of or the result of, fraud or any willful or intentional breach of

aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law
or in equity.

affiliates) shall have made an Acquisition Proposal, which shall have been
publicly announced or publicly disclosed or otherwise publicly communicated to
the Board of Directors of the Company and not have been withdrawn at least ten
business days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (y) within
twelve months after such termination of this Agreement the Company shall have
consummated, or shall have entered into an agreement to consummate (which may

earlier of the public announcement of the Companys entry into such agreement
or the consummation of any such Acquisition Transaction.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by ETP pursuant to Section 7.1(f) and an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made for the Company on or prior to the
Termination Date, whether or not publicly announced or publicly disclosed,
then (i) the Company shall pay to ETP the ETP Expenses, by wire transfer of
same day federal funds to the account specified by ETP within three (3)
business days following the termination, and (ii) if within twelve months
after such termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have consummated,

consummated after such twelve-month period), an Acquisition Transaction, then
the Company shall pay to ETP an amount equal to the Breakup Fee less any ETP
Expenses paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3(d), by wire
transfer of same day federal funds to the account specified by ETP, on the
earlier of the public announcement of the Companys entry into such agreement
or the consummation of any such Acquisition Transaction.

(e) Solely for purposes of this Section 7.3, " _Acquisition Transaction_ "
shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 5.4, except that all
references to twenty-five percent (25%) shall be changed to seventy-five

\- 75 - (f) As used in this Agreement, " _ETP Expenses_ " means the documented out-of-
pocket expenses incurred and paid by or on behalf of the ETP Parties and ETE
to any unaffiliated third-party in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any documented
commitment, underwriting, extension, ticking, structuring, fronting,

arranging financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ that in no event shall the ETP Expenses exceed $10 million.

(h) Upon payment of the Breakup Fee and/or the ETP Expenses, as applicable, to
ETP pursuant to Section 7.3(a), 7.3(b), 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), the Company shall
have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to ETP or its unitholders; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall release any party from liability arising out of or the result of fraud
or a willful or intentional breach of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge
and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Breakup
Fee, as applicable, on more than one occasion. In addition, the parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are not a penalty,
and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into this
Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 7.3, the Company will also pay to ETP interest on the unpaid
amount under this Section 7.3, accruing from its due date, at an interest rate
per annum equal to two percentage points in excess of the prime commercial
lending rate quoted by _The Wall Street Journal_ and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses (including legal fees) in connection with any action taken to
collect payment. Any change in the interest rate hereunder resulting from a
change in such prime rate will be effective at the beginning of the date of
such change in such prime rate.

it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or similar instrument. In addition, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and

process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted
by the applicable Law, any claim

 



\- 77 -  that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable

parties; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) Merger Sub may assign any of its

null and void.

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits

entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to

grant standing to any person other than the parties hereto.

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such

expand the obligations of ETE under this Agreement or the Partnership
Agreement Amendment or (ii) amend any provision of Section 5.2(b)(iv)(E) or
Article VIII in a manner that would apply to ETE, also in writing and signed
by ETE) or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of Company
Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law
or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE require further
approval of the stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such
amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of the stockholders of
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any party
hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

Consideration on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, this Agreement is

representations and warranties set forth herein.
