Entity and the Surviving Partnership) or the Exchange Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, trustee, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable
to any holder of Starwood Waypoint Common Shares in respect of any cash that

Section 3.12. _Withholding Rights_. Each Party (including the Surviving Entity
and the Surviving Partnership) and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger
Consideration and any other amounts or property otherwise payable or
distributable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or
property (or portions thereof) as such Party or the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or
distribution under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any other provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity or Surviving Partnership, as applicable, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as
the Surviving Entity or Surviving Partnership, as applicable, may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen

Consideration, as applicable, to which the holder thereof is entitled

Each holder of Starwood Waypoint Common Shares converted pursuant to the REIT
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Invitation Homes Common Stock (after aggregating all shares evidenced by
the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive
from the Exchange Agent, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, a cash
payment (without interest) in an amount representing such holders
proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent
on behalf of all such holders of Invitation Homes Common Stock that would
otherwise be issued. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Invitation Homes Common Stock does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration and solely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the
fractions in the exchange.

Section 3.16. _Certain Governance Matters_.

 

(a) Invitation Homes shall take all requisite action prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time to cause (i) the Invitation Homes Board as of the REIT Merger
Effective Time to consist of eleven (11) members, comprised of (A) Barry S.

Jonathan D. Gray, Robert G. Harper or William J. Stein is unable or unwilling
to serve, for any reason, as a director on the Invitation Homes Board at the
REIT Merger Effective Time, the Majority Shareholders shall have the right to
designate another individual to become an Invitation Homes Designee in the

supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under

Starwood Waypoint Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or incorporated by

subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial

assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, including that: (1) transactions are executed only in accordance with
managements authorization and (2) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of the financial statements of the Starwood Waypoint
Entities and to maintain accountability for the assets of the Starwood
Waypoint Entities. Since January 5, 2016, Starwood Waypoint has disclosed to
Starwood Waypoints auditors and the Starwood Waypoint Board or the audit
committee of the Starwood Waypoint Board (i) all significant deficiencies and

information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the

knowledge of Starwood Waypoint, otherwise threatened to raise, a material
claim against any Starwood Waypoint Entity for any breach of any Starwood

Starwood Waypoint or Invitation Homes, as applicable, may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i)_
in order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for

Change pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_ or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)(i)_,
respectively, unless (i) such Party (the " _notifying party_ ") has provided
prior written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to
Starwood Waypoint or Invitation Homes, as applicable (the " _recipient party_
") that the Starwood Waypoint Board or the Invitation Homes Board, as
applicable, intends to take such action, identifying the Person making such
Superior Proposal and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor
and, in the case of a Starwood Waypoint Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Invitation Homes Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, describing the
material terms

 



70  and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Superior Proposal
that is the basis of such action (including copies of the current drafts of
all agreements, commitment letters and other documentation and correspondence
that relate to such Superior Proposal), (ii) during the five (5) Business Day
period following the recipient partys receipt of the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change, the notifying party shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with the recipient party (and its
Representatives) in good faith (to the extent the recipient party requests to
negotiate) to make such changes, revisions, modifications and adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of such
five (5) Business Day period, the Starwood Waypoint Board or the Invitation
Homes Board, as applicable, shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, taking into
account any changes, revisions, modifications and adjustments which may be
offered by the recipient party in response to the Notice of Adverse
Recommendation Change or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to
the Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal. Any change to the financial terms or any change in any material
respect to any of the other terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change, the Party required to deliver
such new Notice of Adverse Recommendation Change shall again comply with the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_, and the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_ shall apply to such amended Superior Proposal.

Agreement shall prohibit Starwood Waypoint or the Starwood Waypoint Board, or
Invitation Homes or the Invitation Homes Board, from (i) taking and disclosing

applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication to the holders of Starwood Waypoint Common Shares or Invitation

Exchange Act, so long as in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) (A) any such
disclosure includes the Starwood Waypoint Board Recommendation or Invitation
Homes Board Recommendation, as applicable, without any modification or
qualification thereof or continues the prior recommendation of the Starwood
Waypoint Board or Invitation Homes Board, as the case may be, and (B) any
such disclosure does not contain either an express Starwood Waypoint Adverse
Recommendation Change or an Invitation Homes Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable, or any other statements by or on behalf of the Starwood Waypoint

make any Starwood Waypoint Adverse Recommendation Change or Invitation Homes
Adverse Recommendation Change, respectively, except as permitted by _Section_
__ _ 6.5(d)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that
neither Starwood Waypoint or the Starwood Waypoint Board or Invitation Homes
or the Invitation Homes Board shall be permitted to recommend that the
shareholders of Starwood Waypoint or the stockholders of Invitation Homes, as
the case may be, tender any securities in connection with any tender offer or
exchange offer that is an Acquisition Proposal or effect a Starwood Waypoint

Change, as applicable, with respect thereto, except as permitted by _Section_
__ _ 6.5(d)_.

Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with such
Partys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, (A) is reasonably likely
to be consummated if accepted and (B) would result, if consummated, in a
transaction that is more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Starwood Waypoint Common Shares or Invitation Homes Common Stock
(solely in their capacity as such), as applicable, than the REIT Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby after taking into account the
likelihood

 



72  and timing of consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated
hereby (including any changes, revisions, modifications or adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the other Party and any other information
provided by the other Party)) and such other matters that the Starwood

all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,
or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other
Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers and the

responding to all requests by a Governmental Authority or other Person for
additional information in support of any such filing or request for approval
or waiver), (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order

avoidance of each and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as reasonably practicable, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the
Starwood Waypoint Parties and the Invitation Homes Parties shall give (or
shall cause the other Starwood Waypoint Entities or the other Invitation Homes
Entities, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties, and each of the
Starwood Waypoint Parties and the Invitation Homes Parties shall use, and
cause each of the other Starwood Waypoint Entities or the other Invitation
Homes Entities, respectively, to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain
any Third Party consents not covered by _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Mergers. Each of the Parties
will furnish to the other Parties such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Parties may request in connection with the preparation
of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in
responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including promptly
informing the other Parties of such inquiry, consulting in advance before
making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and
supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or
communications between either Party and any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement. The Parties or their Representatives shall have the
right to review in advance and each of the Parties will consult the others
on, all the information relating to the other Parties and each of their
Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that
confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from

shall, nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or

 



73  engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, approval, investigation or other inquiry without giving
the other Party prior notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, without giving the other Parties the
opportunity to attend or participate (whether by telephone or in person) in
any such meeting with such Governmental Authority.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to the contrary, the
Parties shall not be required pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to
propose, commit to or effect any action that is not conditioned on the

(a) Starwood Waypoint shall give prompt notice to Invitation Homes, and
Invitation Homes shall give prompt notice to Starwood Waypoint, of any notice
or other communication received by such Party or its Subsidiaries from any

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Starwood Waypoint shall give prompt notice to Invitation Homes, and
Invitation Homes shall give prompt notice to Starwood Waypoint, if (i) any
representation or warranty made by it or its Subsidiaries contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to
expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it or one or more of its Subsidiaries
fails to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and the
failure to comply with this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ will not constitute a breach
or noncompliance of a covenant by such Party for determining the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_. Without limiting the foregoing, Starwood Waypoint shall give prompt
notice to Invitation Homes, and Invitation Homes shall give prompt notice to
Starwood Waypoint, if, to the knowledge of such Party, the occurrence of any
state of facts, change, development, event or condition would cause, or would
reasonably be expected to cause, any of the conditions to Closing set forth
herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to be materially delayed.

(c) Each of the Parties agrees to give prompt written notice to the other
Parties upon becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any
event or circumstance relating to it or any of the other Starwood Waypoint
Entities or the other Invitation Homes Entities, respectively, which could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Starwood
Waypoint Material Adverse Effect or an Invitation Homes Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be.

 

(d) Starwood Waypoint shall give prompt notice to Invitation Homes, and
Invitation Homes shall give prompt notice to Starwood Waypoint, of any Action
commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving such Party or any of the other Starwood Waypoint Entities or the
other Invitation Homes Entities, respectively, which relates to this
Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Starwood Waypoint shall give the Invitation Homes Parties the
opportunity to reasonably participate, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, in (but not control) the defense and settlement of any shareholder
litigation against any Starwood Waypoint Entity and/or its trustees or
directors relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Invitation Homes prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). The Invitation
Homes Parties shall give Starwood Waypoint the opportunity to reasonably
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in (but
not control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against
the Invitation Homes Parties and/or their trustees or directors relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Starwood Waypoints prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).

 



74 Section 6.8. _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent disclosed in or
consistent with the Disclosure Document and Form S-4, for so long as this
Agreement is in effect, the Parties shall to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing any press release
or otherwise making any public statements or filings (and the Parties shall
cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such press release or public
statement or filing) with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and none of the Parties shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement or filing prior to such
consultation; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party may, without consulting
with the other Parties, issue such press release or make such public
statement or filing as may be required by Law, Order or the applicable rules
of any stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of
any Party hereto.

 

Section 6.9. _Trustees_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity and
its Subsidiaries shall, and Invitation Homes shall cause the Surviving Entity
and its Subsidiaries to, (i) honor and maintain in effect for a period of six
(6) years from the REIT Merger Effective Time all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses of each Indemnitee provided to
such Indemnitee by the Starwood Waypoint Entities immediately prior to the
REIT Merger Effective Time in the Starwood Waypoint Declaration of Trust and
the Starwood Waypoint Bylaws or each of the Starwood Waypoint Subsidiaries
respective articles, certificates of incorporation, declaration of trust or
bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) as the case may
be, as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) honor all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of each Indemnitee
as provided in any indemnification or other similar agreement to which any
Starwood Waypoint Entity is a party as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ that such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
covers actions or omissions at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.9(a)_, during the period commencing as of the REIT Merger Effective Time
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the REIT Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall (and Invitation Homes shall cause the Surviving
Entity to), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises out of or
pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission prior to
the REIT Merger Effective Time in such Indemnitees capacity as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, employee, fiduciary or agent of any
Starwood Waypoint Entity or as fiduciary under any Starwood Waypoint Benefit
Plan, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Mergers, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the REIT Merger Effective Time; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses and disbursements and any expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in
connection with enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any
Indemnitee without the requirement of any bond or other security, in each
case to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but subject to Invitation Homes
and the Surviving Entitys receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Invitation Homes and the Surviving
Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), (ii) shall not have any obligation under
this Agreement to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to Invitation Homes or the Surviving Entity the amount
of all such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant thereto (unless such court
orders otherwise) and (iii) shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any Action (in which indemnification could be sought
by an Indemnitee hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability
arising out of such Action or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing.

 



75 (c) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, Starwood Waypoint may in its
discretion, in consultation with Invitation Homes, or, if Starwood Waypoint
declines to do so, Invitation Homes may in its discretion cause the Surviving
Entity as of the REIT Merger Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the coverage afforded by Starwood
Waypoints existing trustees and officers liability insurance policies and
Starwood Waypoints existing fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the REIT Merger
Effective Time with respect to any claim arising from facts, acts, events or
omissions that occurred during any period of time at or prior to the REIT
Merger Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same or
better Bests credit rating as Starwood Waypoints current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with retentions and levels of coverage that are
no less favorable than, and with other terms and conditions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than, the coverage provided under
Starwood Waypoints existing policies and with limits of liability that are
no lower than the limits on Starwood Waypoints existing policies as long as
the annual premium in the aggregate does not exceed, in any one year, three-
hundred percent (300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) under Starwood
Waypoints existing policies. If Starwood Waypoint or the Surviving Entity for
any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the REIT
Merger Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain,
and Invitation Homes shall cause to be maintained, in effect, for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with Starwood Waypoints
current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better
Bests credit rating as Starwood Waypoints current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with retentions and levels of coverage that are no
less favorable than, and with other terms and conditions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than, the coverage provided under Starwood
Waypoints existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii)
Invitation Homes shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the REIT Merger
Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under Starwood Waypoints DandO
Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for facts,
events, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
Starwood Waypoints current insurance carrier and with retentions and levels
of coverage that are no less favorable than, and with other terms and
conditions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, the existing
policy of Starwood Waypoint (which may be provided under Invitation Homes
DandO Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Invitation Homes and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of (for any one year) three-
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by Starwood Waypoint for
such insurance as of the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Invitation Homes or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to facts, acts, events or
omissions occurring prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(d) The Indemnitees are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
6.9_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee and his or her successors or
heirs. Invitation Homes shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person or any employee of any Starwood Waypoint
Entity may have under the Starwood Waypoint Declaration of Trust, the Starwood
Waypoint Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents) of any of the Starwood Waypoint
Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any
applicable Law, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
trustees and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to Starwood Waypoint or its officers, trustees and
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any
such claims under any such policies.

 



76 (f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ or  _Section_
__ _ 9.7_ to the contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall survive the
consummation of the Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Invitation Homes, the Surviving
Entity and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and
their successors or heirs. In the event that Invitation Homes or the Surviving
Entity or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Invitation Homes shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Invitation
Homes or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

Section 6.10. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
(i) prepare all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the tax treatment and
consequences contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "), (ii) except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"final determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or
any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) not take any position on
any Tax Return, in connection with any Tax Proceeding or otherwise that is
inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment, (iii) not take any action (or
fail to take any action) if such action (or failure to act) could reasonably
be expected to cause the REIT Merger or the Partnership Merger not to have the
Intended Tax Treatment and (iv) otherwise use their reasonable efforts to
cause the REIT Merger, and the Partnership Merger to have the Intended Tax
Treatment.

(b) Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes shall reasonably cooperate to
prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all
returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real
property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer,
recording, registration stamp or similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
" _Transfer Taxes_ ") and Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes shall
cooperate to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

(c) On the Closing Date, prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, Starwood
Waypoint shall deliver to Invitation Homes a duly executed certificate of non-
foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in the form
of the sample certification set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 

Section 6.11. _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time, Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes shall, as applicable, take all
such steps to cause any dispositions or acquisitions of Starwood Waypoint
Common Shares or Invitation Homes Common Stock (including derivative
securities related to Starwood Waypoint Common Shares or Invitation Homes
Common Stock, as applicable) resulting from the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to Starwood Waypoint as of immediately prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Invitation Homes, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Upon request,
Starwood Waypoint shall promptly furnish Invitation Homes with all requisite
information for Invitation Homes to take the actions contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

Section 6.12. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Invitation Homes shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Invitation Homes Common Stock
to be issued in the REIT Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, and
any shares of Invitation Homes Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon
conversion or exchange of the Starwood Waypoint Convertible Notes, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time.

Section 6.13.  _Employee Matters_.

(a) For one (1) year following the REIT Merger Effective Time, Invitation
Homes shall provide, or shall cause the Invitation Homes Subsidiaries to
provide, the employees of Starwood Waypoint or Invitation

 



77  Homes and their respective Subsidiaries as of the REIT Merger Effective Time
who continue employment with any Invitation Homes Entity following the REIT
Merger Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), total compensation
opportunities and employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such
Continuing Employees by Starwood Waypoint or Invitation Homes, as applicable,
immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time.

(b) Invitation Homes shall, or shall cause the Invitation Homes Subsidiaries
to, cause its Benefit Plans to take into account, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, levels of benefits and benefit accrual thereunder, the service of the
Continuing Employees with the Starwood Waypoint Entities (including any
predecessor entities) as if such service were with Invitation Homes, to the
same extent that such service was credited under a comparable Starwood
Waypoint Benefit Plan (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period of service).

(c) From and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, with respect to each
Continuing Employee (and their respective beneficiaries), Invitation Homes
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cause each disability, medical,
dental, or health plan of Invitation Homes or the Invitation Homes
Subsidiaries to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent
such conditions were covered under the applicable disability, medical, dental,
or health plans of Starwood Waypoint or the Starwood Waypoint Subsidiaries,
(ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees and their respective
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to commencement
of participation in such Invitation Homes Benefit Plan, and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation, evidence of insurability requirement or actively-
at-work requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing
Employee and their respective beneficiaries on or after the REIT Merger
Effective Time to the extent such Continuing Employee or beneficiary had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior
to the REIT Merger Effective Time.

 

(d) All fiscal year 2017 bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other
cash incentive plans of Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes will be
calculated and paid (both in terms of timing and amount) in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice (including as to timing of
determination of achievement of applicable performance targets and as to
timing of payment);  _provided_ , that, the applicable performance targets
may be adjusted, as reasonably determined by the Invitation Homes Board (or a
committee thereof), to reflect (i) any non-recurring charges incurred or
accrued during the 2017 fiscal year (whether prior to or following the REIT
Merger Effective Time) that arise as a direct result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that would not reasonably be expected to
have been incurred by Starwood Waypoint or Invitation Homes had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not taken place and (ii) any other
equitable adjustments deemed appropriate in light of the combination of the
Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes businesses, assets, and liabilities.

(e) In the event that Starwood Waypoint and Invitation Homes reasonably
determine that the REIT Merger Effective Time will not occur prior to
December 31, 2017, to the extent reasonably requested by Invitation Homes, the
Starwood Waypoint Entities shall, in order to mitigate the impact of Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code, make or deliver payments or awards in 2017 that

_further_ , that such termination shall not be effective until Invitation
Homes has paid the Termination Fee and the Expense Amount in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_;

 

(ii) if (A) the Starwood Waypoint Board shall have made a Starwood Waypoint
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) Starwood Waypoint enters into an

(iii) if any Starwood Waypoint Party shall have breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set

cured on or before the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Invitation

and all rights and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
(a) no such termination shall relieve any Party of any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of any intentional fraud arising out of the
representations and warranties contained herein or willful and material breach
of any covenant or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, in which case
the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at
law or in equity and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, _Article_ __ _ IX_ and

not later than two Business Days after the earlier of the execution of such

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that under no circumstances shall Starwood Waypoint or
Invitation Homes be required to pay the Termination Fee or the Expense Amount
on more than one occasion, and that in no event shall the aggregate payments
by a Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_,
as applicable, be greater than the Termination Fee plus the Expense Amount, in
each case except as set forth in clause _(a)_ of _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ or in 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(d)_.

(d) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) neither the Termination Fee nor the
Expense Amount is a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate such Party in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and
(iii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Termination Payor (as defined below) fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Termination Payee commences a suit that results in
a judgment against such Termination Payor for the payment of any amount set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, such Termination Payor shall pay the
Termination Payee (or its designee) its costs and expenses in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ (on the date such payment was required
to be made) for the period from the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as
is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ shall apply with respect to any
Termination Payment required to be made hereunder.

 

(i) If Starwood Waypoint or Invitation Homes (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is
required to pay the other Party (the " _Termination Payee_ ") a Termination
Payment, such Termination Payment shall be paid into

 



88  escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Termination
Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_. In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated to pay the
Termination Payee the Termination Payment, the amount payable to the
Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed
the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment payable to the Termination Payee,
and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the
Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the
Termination Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the
Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination Payees
counsel indicating that the Termination Payee has received a ruling from the
IRS as described below in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ or (y) an opinion from
the Termination Payees outside counsel as described below in this _Section_
__ _ 8.3(e)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment less
the amount payable under clause (A) above.

(ii) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Payment with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on
such terms (subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ shall be made at the time the Termination
Payor is obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall
provide that the Termination Payment in escrow or any portion thereof shall
not be released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow agent receives any
one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Termination Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter
from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) the Termination Payees outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Payment should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Payment to the Termination Payee. The Termination
Payor agrees to amend this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_ at the reasonable request
of the Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the portion of the
Termination Payment that may be distributed to the Termination Payee hereunder
without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the Termination Payee
in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in
each case, as described in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_. Any amount of the
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_.

Section 8.4. _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Starwood
Waypoint Shareholder Approval or the Invitation Homes Stockholder Approval
and prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Starwood Waypoint Shareholder Approval or the Invitation Homes
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of
this Agreement that, by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any
stock exchange, requires the further approval of the shareholders of Starwood
Waypoint or 

 



89  the stockholders of Invitation Homes, as applicable, without obtaining such
further approval of such holders. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

Section 8.5. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, the Invitation Homes Parties, on the one hand, and
the Starwood Waypoint Parties, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of the others, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the others contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement of the
others or any condition of such Parties contained herein. Except as required
by applicable Law, no such extension or waiver shall require the approval of
the holders of Starwood Waypoint Common Shares. Any agreement on the part of a
Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by any Starwood Waypoint
Party or Invitation Homes Party in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

 

Section 8.6. _Transaction Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that Starwood
Waypoint and Invitation Homes shall share equally all Expenses related to the
printing and filing of the Form S-4 and the printing, filing and distribution
of the Disclosure Document, other than attorneys and accountants fees.

Section 8.7. _Transfer Taxes_. From and after the REIT Merger Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the
Starwood Waypoint Common Shares or Starwood Waypoint LP Units except, in each
case, as otherwise provided by  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(c)_, all Transfer Taxes
imposed in connection with the REIT Merger or the Partnership Merger.

Section 9.3. _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the Starwood Waypoint
Disclosure Letter and the Invitation Homes Disclosure Letter. When a reference
is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or
Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include,"

 



91  "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other
instrument made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein.
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the
case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws. References to a
Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. All references to
"dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of America (unless
otherwise expressly provided herein).

Section 9.4. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid
or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance here from so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect promptly the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.5. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the
Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other Party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries of Invitation Homes. Subject to the preceding
sentence, but without relieving any Party of any obligation hereunder, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 9.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Annexes and Appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 9.7. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended
to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except (i) for
the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ (from and after the REIT Merger
Effective Time), which shall be to the benefit of the Person referred to in
such section and (ii) for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.19_, which are
for the benefit of the Holders (as defined in the Starwood Waypoint
Registration Rights Agreement or the Invitation Homes Registration Rights
Agreement, as applicable), as applicable. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are
for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other Person. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly, Persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
a Partys measure of damages for any breach of this Agreement by another
Party may include the loss of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the holders of such Partys common stock,
common shares or partnership interests, as applicable.

 



92 Section 9.8. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Section 9.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission
or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Actions (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Maryland, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Maryland;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Mergers shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

 

Section 9.11. _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland) and to
the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of
Maryland (the " _MD Courts_ "), for the purpose of any Action (whether based
