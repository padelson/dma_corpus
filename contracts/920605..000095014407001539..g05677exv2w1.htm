counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the
Company of the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Expenses would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections&nbsp;856(c)(2) and (3)&nbsp;of
