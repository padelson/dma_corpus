EFFECTS OF THE MERGER  

  

 Section 3.1 _Effects on Shares_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo, the Company or any of their respective shareholders: 

  

 (a) Each common share of MergerCo, par value $0.01 per share (the " _MergerCo Common Shares_ "), shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Entity, par value $0.01 per share. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any of the Acquired Companies or by Parent, MergerCo or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall automatically be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive an amount in cash to be paid by Parent equal to $14.10, less the Lady Luck Adjustment Amount, if any, without interest (the " _Company Common Share Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (d) Not later than the earlier of the time at which the Company gives notice of the Contemplated Transactions to its shareholders and the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall notify each holder of the options granted pursuant to the Company Plan (" _Options_ "), in writing, of the Contemplated Transactions in accordance with the Company Plan (the " _Option Holder Notice_ "). Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, all such Options that remain unvested automatically shall become fully vested. The Option Holder Notice shall (i) apprise the holders of outstanding Options of their ability to exercise the Options in accordance with the Company Plan prior to the Merger Effective Time, (ii) disclose that, if not exercised, such Options will terminate at the Merger Effective Time and (iii) disclose that if any Options are not exercised prior to the Merger 

    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time and terminate as contemplated in clause (ii), the holders of
such Options will be entitled to receive the Option Merger Consideration in
respect of such Options. As of the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding
Option shall be terminated by virtue of the Merger and each holder of an
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive, in respect of each such terminated Option, a single lump
sum payment (without interest and subject to the deduction and withholding
of such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law) in cash an amount equal to the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, minus the exercise price for such Option (the " _Option
Merger Consideration_ "). Payment of the Option Merger Consideration to each
of the holders of Options entitled thereto shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Merger Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Any amounts withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying
Agent will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Option in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made. If the exercise price per share of any such Option is equal to or
greater than the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, such Option shall
be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Prior to
the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required by the
Company Plan under which such Options were granted to cause such Company Plan
and all Options granted thereunder to terminate at the Merger Effective Time,
including adopting any plan amendments and resolutions and obtaining any
required Consents, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or
obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (e) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, all restricted share awards (" _Restricted Shares_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Plan or otherwise that remain unvested automatically shall become fully vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions and each Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions and will take such other actions, including adopting any plan amendments and obtaining any required Consents, as shall be required to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 3.1(e), without paying any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (f) If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Merger Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange, recapitalization, or any dividend or other distribution payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such period, or other similar transaction, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration and the Common Unit Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted so that the aggregate amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to effect the Merger Transactions shall not have increased as a result of such adjustment. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (g) Each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of Company Series B Preferred Stock of the Surviving Entity and shall otherwise be unaffected by the Merger Transactions. 

   

 Section 3.2 _Effect on Partnership Units_. 

  

 At the Merger Effective Time: 

  

 (a) Parent shall purchase one hundred (100) Common Units of the Operating Partnership for a cash purchase price of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and Parent shall be a limited partner of the Operating Partnership. 

   

 (b) Each Common Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall automatically be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive, at the Merger Effective Time, an amount in cash to be paid by Parent equal to the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, without interest, multiplied by the Conversion Factor (as defined in the Operating Partnership Agreement) for each Common Unit (the " _Common Unit Consideration_ "). 

   

 (c) Each Series B Preferred Unit outstanding under the Operating Partnership immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding and be unaffected by the Merger Transactions. 

   

 Section 3.3 _Exchange Procedures; Stock Transfer Books_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying and exchange agent hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause any of the Acquired Companies to, deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an amount necessary to pay all of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration and Common Unit Consideration, which amount may include all or any portion of the consideration paid by the Development Sale Purchaser and/or one or more of its Affiliates to the relevant Acquired Companies in connection with the Development Sale in accordance with the Development Purchase Agreement (the " _Development Sale Consideration_ "). The amounts deposited pursuant to the prior sentence shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund._ " Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration and Common Unit Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. 

   

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event more than five (5) business days after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to send (i) to each Person who was, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, a holder of record of certificates of Company Common Stock and/or Common Units (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify including (1) a provision confirming that delivery of certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to 

     ##### 

  

    

certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of such
certificates to the Paying Agent, and (2) a form of certification by the
Person executing such letter of transmittal to the effect that either (x) such
Person is not "foreign" for purposes of Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code or
(y) such Person has not owned, directly or indirectly, more than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding Company Common Stock at any time during the five (5)
years preceding the Merger Effective Time, and (B), if
applicable, instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates
in exchange for either Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Common
Unit Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled, and (ii) to each
holder of an Option, a check in an amount equal to the Option
Merger Consideration due and payable to such holder pursuant to Section
3.1(d) in respect of such Option. Upon surrender of a certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, if applicable, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal (completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto) and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent or Parent, (A) the holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Common
Unit Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Common Units, as applicable, pursuant to the provisions of this
Article III and (B) the certificates (if any) so surrendered shall be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3(b), each
certificate shall be deemed from and after the Merger Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the applicable
Company Common Share Merger Consideration or Common Unit Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 3.3(b). No interest shall be paid or accrue on
any of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger
Consideration or Common Unit Consideration. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock or Common Units that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company or the Operating Partnership, if
applicable, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the certificate (if any) so surrendered is registered, if such
certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. If any certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of any portion of the Exchange Fund,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to provide
an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claims that may be made against
the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Entity with respect to such
certificate. 

   

 (c) As of the Merger Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled and retired in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares shall cease to be holders thereof and to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate (if any) representing such shares in accordance with this Section 3.3. The Company Common Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of certificates (if any) in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.3 shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Common Stock exchanged therefor and, if applicable, represented by such certificates exchanged therefor. The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to the Options in accordance with the terms 

    ##### 

  

    

of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights and privileges pertaining to the canceled Options, and on and
after the Merger Effective Time the holder of an Option shall have no further
rights with respect to any Option, other than the right to receive the Option
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(d). 

   

 (d) As of the Merger Effective Time, all Common Units shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Common Unit Holder shall cease to be a holder thereof and to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Common Unit Consideration. The Common Unit Consideration paid upon the surrender of certificates (if any) in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.3 shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Common Units to be redeemed therefor and, if applicable, represented by such certificates exchanged therefor. 

   

 (e) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of the Companys Common Stock on the records of the Company. 

   

 (f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in liquid debt securities rated AA or higher by at least two nationally-recognized rating agencies or as otherwise directed by Parent; _provided_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the Companys shareholders and Option holders pursuant to this Section 3.3. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or Common Unit Consideration as contemplated hereby (other than as a result of the failure of the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.3 to be true and correct), Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost though investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make all such payments in full. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Parent. 

   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Common Units or Options as of the date twelve (12) months after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or the Surviving Entity, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Common Units or Options prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Section 3.3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity or Parent for payment of any portion of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option Merger Consideration or Common Unit Consideration. 

   

 (h) None of the Buyer Parties, the Company Parties, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock, Options, Common Units, or to any other Person, with respect to any portion of the Company Common Share Consideration, Common Unit Consideration or Option Merger Consideration, or for any cash amounts, if the Exchange Fund has properly been delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. If any certificate has not 

    ##### 

  

     

been surrendered prior to three (3) years after the Merger Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Company Common Share
Merger Consideration, Common Unit Consideration or Option Merger
Consideration in respect of such certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Body), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. 

   

 Section 3.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payments under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable. 

  

 Section 3.5 _Termination of DRIP_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate its Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (the " _DRIP_ "), effective as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement, and ensure that no purchase or other rights under the DRIP enable the holder of such rights to acquire any interest in the Surviving Entity or any other Company Party or Buyer Party as a result of such purchase or the exercise of such rights at or after such date. 

  

 Section 3.6 _Further Actions_. If at any time after the Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of any of the Acquired Companies or MergerCo or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Entity and its proper officers and directors or its designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, MergerCo and the Operating Partnership, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, MergerCo and the Operating Partnership all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of any of the Acquired Companies or MergerCo, as applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

     ##### 

  

    

good faith, after consultation with the Companys (or the Special Committees,
as applicable) outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements, but only after
following the Superior Proposal Termination Procedures. 

   

 (d) Until the earlier of the Merger Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article XI, the Company shall immediately (i) cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, discussion, negotiation or other action conducted by any of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal effective as of the date hereof, (ii) request that all confidential information previously furnished to any third party be returned promptly and (iii) deny access to any data room containing any such information to any third party (other than the Buyer Parties and their respective Representatives), in each case, subject to the Companys rights and obligations in Section 6.3(a).

Each Covered Party will be entitled, subject to applicable Legal Requirements, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of or other participation in any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of Parent and the Surviving Entity within ten (10) business days of receipt by Parent or the Surviving Entity from the Covered Party of a request therefor;  _provided_ , that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (b) The Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity shall contain, and Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Entity to so contain, provisions no less favorable to the Covered Parties with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Acquired   ##### 

  

  

  

Companies than are presently set forth in the Organizational Documents of the
Acquired Companies. 

   

 (c) At the Companys election, in consultation with Parent, (i) the Company shall purchase prior to the Closing, and the Surviving Entity shall maintain following the Closing, "tail" or "run-off" insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with respect to the current directors and officers liability insurance of the Company with substantially the same coverage and in amount and scope no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company (the " _Current Policy_ ") for claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) if the Company shall not have obtained such policies, Parent will provide, or cause the Company to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Covered Parties who are insured under the Current Policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Closing that is no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the Current Policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend annually in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company under the Current Policy (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance Amount, the Company shall be obligated to obtain, and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to maintain, a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Insurance Amount. Parent shall pay or cause Company to pay for all premiums under the tail or run-off insurance policies and directors and officers insurance and indemnification policies contemplated by this Section 7.5(c) not exceeding the Insurance Amount.

The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to any of the Acquired Companies, including the Current Policy, or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.5 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Parent
nor the Company shall, and shall not permit any of their respective
Representatives to, make any disclosure regarding this Agreement or any of
the Merger Transactions unless (a) the other shall have approved such

Entities, as reasonably requested by Parent and (xiii) taking such other
actions related to such Financing or Alternative Financing as are reasonably
required by Parent; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require
such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operation of any of the Acquired Companies; _provided_ _further_
that none of the Acquired Companies shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or make any other payment other than reasonable out-of-
pocket costs or incur any other material liability in connection with

expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or the Alternative
Financing (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 7.8(a))
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Acquired Companies). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, the condition set forth in Section 9.2, as it applies to the
Companys obligations under this Section 7.8(a), shall be deemed satisfied
unless the Acquired Companies have materially contributed to the failure of
the Financing (or any Alternative Financing) to be obtained as a result of
the Acquired Companies material breach of their obligations under this
Section 7.8(a). 

   

 (b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to the Buyer Parties in such definitive agreements that are within their control. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Commitment Letters or any termination of the Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed as to the status of the Financing and the Alternative Financing and shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters without first consulting with the Company or, if such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect or delay Parents ability to consummate the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions, without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Companys accountants

that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by
the Company of the Parent Termination Fee and the Company Expenses would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, the Companys outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Termination Fee and
the Company Expenses would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of

In the event any party hereto is required to file suit to seek all or portion of the amounts payable under this Section 11.3, and such party hereto prevails in such litigation, such party hereto shall be awarded to all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, that it has incurred in enforcing its rights under this Section 11.3.

 (b) At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent (with respect to the Company Parties) and the Company (with respect to the Buyer Parties), may, to the extent allowed by any applicable Legal Requirements, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of such party to this Agreement, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the   ##### 

   

  

  

representation and warranties contained in this Agreement and (iii) waive
compliance with any covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to this Agreement to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party hereto. 

   

 Section 12.3 _No Survival_. None of the representations and warranties, or any covenant to be performed prior to the Merger Effective Time, contained in this Agreement shall survive the Merger Effective Time. This Section 12.3 shall not limit the survival of any covenant or agreement of the parties to this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance, in whole or in part, after the Merger Effective Time. 

  

 Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents relating to the Merger Transactions and the Exhibits attached to this Agreement), including the Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the parties hereto with respect thereto. 

  

 Section 12.5 _Execution of Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

This Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto hereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (except that the provisions of the NCBCA applicable to the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions shall govern the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions and Articles II and III to the extent mandatorily required thereby), without regard to conflicts of laws principles. 

  

 Section 12.7 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement or any of the Merger Transactions shall be brought against any of the parties only in the courts of the State of Delaware or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the courts of the United States of America located in New Castle County, Delaware, and each of the parties hereto consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding, waives any objection to venue laid therein and agrees not to plead or claim in any such courts that such proceeding brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party hereto in the manner provided in Section 12.13 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.    #####

EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.8. 

  

 Section 12.9 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 12.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity and the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy. Without limiting the right to receive any reimbursement it may be entitled to receive under Section 7.8(a), each of the Company Parties agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in connection with this Agreement the maximum aggregate liability (including any amounts paid or payable by Parent pursuant to Section 11.3(a)) of the Buyer Parties and the Guarantors for such losses or damages shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Guarantees, and in no event shall the Company Parties and any of their respective Representatives and Affiliates seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount from the Buyer Parties or the Guarantors or their respective Representatives and Affiliates in connection therewith. 

   

 (b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed by the Company Parties in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, the Buyer Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The parties hereto acknowledge that the Company Parties shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Buyer Parties or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that the Company Parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in Sections 11.3(a) and 12.9(a) and the Guarantees; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company Parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by the Buyer Parties of Section 6.1(b).

 Section 12.10 _Disclosure Letter_. If there is any inconsistency between the statements in this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter (other than an exception set forth as such in the Disclosure Letter), the statements in this Agreement will control. 

  

 Section 12.11 _Assignments and Successors_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither this Agreement nor any of the Companys rights hereunder may be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise) by the Company without the prior written consent of Parent;  _provided_ , _further_ , that any of the Buyer Parties may, without the prior written consent of the Company, assign any or all of its rights and/or delegate any or all of its obligations to a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary or other Affiliate of the Buyer Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any such assignment, the Buyer Parties shall remain liable to perform all of their respective obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Buyer Parties and the Surviving Entity may assign and transfer to any entity providing financing for the Merger Transactions (or any refinancing of such financing) as security for such financing all of the interest, rights and remedies of the Buyer Parties and the Surviving Entity with respect to this Agreement. The Company Parties hereby expressly consent to such assignment. Any such assignment will be made for collateral security purposes only and will not release or discharge the Buyer Parties or the Surviving Entity from any obligations they may have pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement or of any such rights by the Company without such consent shall be void and of no effect.
