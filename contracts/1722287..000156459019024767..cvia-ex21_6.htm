Section 1.03Estimated Statement. No later than three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement setting
forth its good faith estimate of each of the following as of the Measurement
Time, all as based on the books and records of the Company and determined and

definitions set forth herein, and in a manner consistent with the Sample
Calculation: (a) Cash, (b) Funded Debt, (c) Working Capital and (d) Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses,

   

together with a calculation of the Closing Date Purchase Price (the "Estimated
Statement"). Concurrently with the Estimated Statement, Seller shall deliver

being paid in connection with the Closing, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable Purchaser and including (i) the amount to be paid at Closing with
respect to such Unpaid Company Transaction Expense, and (ii) the wire transfer
instructions for the recipient thereof.

 

Section 1.04Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and, in any
event, no later than sixty (60) days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as at the
Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a statement (together with the
Closing Balance Sheet, the "Statement") setting forth, in each case, as of the
Measurement Time, Purchaser's calculation of (A) Working Capital, (B) Cash,
(C) Funded Debt and (D) Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, together with a
calculation of the Purchase Price based on such amounts and reasonable
supporting detail, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), based on the
books and records of the Company as of the Measurement Time and determined and
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and applicable
definitions set forth herein, and in a manner consistent with the Sample
Calculation, and without taking into account (x) any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting from the Transactions or (y) any change,
circumstance, act, decision, fact or development occurring after the
Measurement Time for purposes of establishing or altering a reserve or
otherwise. If Purchaser fails to timely deliver or cause to be delivered a
Statement in accordance with this Section 1.04(a), then the Estimated
Statement shall be deemed to be the Statement, and Seller may deliver a Notice
of Disagreement with respect thereto in accordance with Section 1.04(b).

 

(b)During the sixty (60) day period following Seller's receipt of the
Statement, Seller and its Representatives shall be permitted to review any
working papers of Purchaser and its Representatives prepared in connection
with the Statement. The Statement shall become final and binding upon Seller
and Purchaser at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that is sixty
(60) days following Seller's receipt thereof (the "Disagreement Deadline"),
unless Seller gives written notice to Purchaser of its disagreement with the
Statement and any item or calculation set forth therein (a "Notice of
Disagreement") prior to such time; provided, however, that if Purchaser has
not provided the access or information to Seller contemplated by Section
1.04(e), the Disagreement Deadline shall be automatically extended until the
date that is five (5) Business Days after Purchaser provides such access or
information pursuant to Section 1.04(e). If the Notice of Disagreement is
delivered by Seller prior to the Disagreement Deadline, then the Statement (as
revised in accordance with this Section 1.04) shall become final and binding
upon Seller and Purchaser on the earlier of (A) the date Seller and Purchaser
resolve in writing all differences they have with respect to the matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date all disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the thirty
(30) day period following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences that
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
and agree on a final and binding determination of such disputed items or
calculations. If any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement remains
in dispute at the end of such thirty (30) day period, then Seller and
Purchaser shall engage the dispute resolution group of Ernst and Young LLP or,
if Ernst and Young LLP refuses such engagement, the dispute resolution group of
an internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
satisfactory to Seller and Purchaser (the "Accounting Firm"), to resolve any
and all such matters

   

and, no later than five (5) days following such engagement, shall submit to
the Accounting Firm in writing their respective positions with respect to any
and all matters that remain in dispute and that were included in the Notice of
Disagreement. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm
that it (1) shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator, (2) shall review
only the matters that were included in the Notice of Disagreement and that
remain in dispute, (3) shall make its determination in accordance with the
requirements of this Section 1.04 and based solely on the written submissions
of Seller and Purchaser and their respective Representatives and not by
independent review, (4) shall not assign a value for any item that remains in
dispute that is greater than the greatest value, or smaller than the smallest
value, set forth by either Seller or Purchaser with respect to such item in
their written submissions to the Accounting Firm and (5) shall render its
written decision as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than thirty
(30) days after submission to the Accounting Firm of the last to be submitted
of all matters in dispute. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller nor
Purchaser shall have any ex parte communications with the Accounting Firm.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Firm shall be limited to whether there were mathematical errors in the
Statement and whether any component of the Purchase Price as calculated in the
Statement was calculated in accordance with the applicable definitions herein,
the Accounting Principles and this Section 1.04, and the Accounting Firm is
not authorized or permitted to make any other determination, including any
determination as to whether the Accounting Principles were followed in
calculating Target Working Capital or whether any inclusion in or omission
from the Sample Calculation is correct. Any determination by the Accounting
Firm, and any work or analysis performed by the Accounting Firm in connection
with its resolution of any dispute under this Section 1.04, shall not be
admissible in evidence in any Proceeding between Seller and Purchaser, other
than to the extent necessary to enforce any payment obligation under Section
1.04(c). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Accounting
Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any determination as to any matter
contemplated by this Agreement, except as set forth in this Section 1.04. The
Accounting Firm's determination shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Accounting Firm that it reached its decision in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 1.04(b). The certificate of the Accounting Firm shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent manifest error or fraud.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in its capacity as such shall be
borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse proportion as such Parties may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations also shall be determined by the Accounting Firm at the time the
determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters
submitted. The fees, costs and expenses of Purchaser incurred in connection
with its preparation of the Statement, its review of any Notice of
Disagreement and its preparation of any written submission to the Accounting
Firm shall be borne by Purchaser, and the fees, costs and expenses of Seller
incurred in connection with its review of the Statement, its preparation of
any Notice of Disagreement and its preparation of any written submission to
the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller.

 

(c)If the Closing Date Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference by wire
transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business Days
after the Statement becomes final and binding on Seller and Purchaser pursuant
to Section 1.04(b). If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Date
Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount of such
difference by

   

wire transfer of immediately available funds no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Statement becomes final and binding on Seller and Purchaser
pursuant to Section 1.04(b).

Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, to the extent such information is reasonably
available to Seller or the Company; provided, that Seller or the Company may
withhold information to the extent that, as determined in the sole discretion
of Seller or the Company, providing such information (i) could unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of Seller or the Company, (ii) could violate or
result in a waiver of any attorney-client privilege of Seller or the Company
or violate any applicable Law (including merger control and competition Laws)
or (iii) could breach any duty of confidentiality or other obligation owed to
any person; provided, further, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, it is understood and agreed

   

that no failure of Seller or the Company to provide information pursuant to
this Section 5.01(b) shall result in the failure of the condition set forth in

minimize disruption to the Company and the Business. Any information provided

breach of by the Company of any representation or warranty of the Company or
covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement solely to the extent such

being made available to it in connection with the Transactions and the
transactions contemplated by each of the Other Transaction Documents is
subject to the terms, conditions and other provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and
only

   

upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect
to information relating to the Company and the Business; provided, that
Purchaser acknowledges that, notwithstanding such termination of the
Confidentiality Agreement, after the Closing, any and all other information
made available to it by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives, concerning Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company) shall remain subject to the terms,
conditions and other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the
Closing. Purchaser shall use, and from and after the Closing shall cause the
Company to use, reasonable best efforts to keep confidential and not disclose
any trade secret, know-how or other confidential information relating to
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Business) to
which Purchaser or the Company had access, or acquired knowledge of, prior to
the Closing. The foregoing shall not limit Purchaser's and the Company's
ability to use any trade secret, know-how or other confidential information,
to the extent relating to the Company and the Business. 

 

Section 6.02No Use of Seller Names and Marks.

 

(a)Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, promptly, and in any event
no later than (i) ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date, amend or
terminate any organizational document, certificate of assumed name or "doing
business as" filing by the Company so as to remove from each such document,
certificate or filing and eliminate its right to use any of the Seller Names
and Marks, (ii) thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, remove any and all
Seller Names and Marks from (1) any signage on any Owned Property, vehicle or
other asset, regardless of the form or medium, and (2) any website or other
media operated in connection with the Business (including any social media,
Internet site or other or similar uses) and (iii) thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date, revise or replace all sales and product literature, purchase
orders, invoices, shipping documents, packaging and labeling and all other
similar materials (regardless of the form or medium) to delete, and cease use
of, all references to any of the Seller Names and Marks; provided, that, with
respect to the foregoing clause (iii), for a period of ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date (unless earlier terminated by Seller pursuant to
Section 6.02(b), the "Transitional Period"), Purchaser and the Company may
continue to distribute sales and product literature and Inventory that uses
any of the Seller Names and Marks in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice and only in the form, and to the extent, that
such sales and product literature and Inventory exist on the Closing Date;
provided, further, that Purchaser complies, and causes the Company to comply,
with the terms and conditions set forth herein and all applicable Law.

 

(b)As between the Parties, Seller is the sole and exclusive owner of all
right, title and interest in and to the Seller Names and Marks and all rights
related thereto and goodwill associated therewith; and all uses of the Seller
Names and Marks and the goodwill arising therefrom shall inure solely to the
benefit of Seller. Any use by Purchaser or the Company of any of the Seller
Names and Marks during the Transitional Period is subject to each of their use
of such Seller Names and Marks in a form and manner, and with standards of
quality, in effect by Seller and its Affiliates with respect thereto as of the
Closing Date and in accordance with all applicable Law. To the extent that
Purchaser, the Company, or any of its or their Affiliates has or acquires any
right, title, and interest in and to the Seller Names or Marks, Purchaser and
the Company shall, and do hereby, assign, and if applicable, shall cause its
or their Affiliates to assign, to Seller all of such right, title, and
interest in and to the Seller Names and Marks.

 

(c)Except as expressly permitted in Section 6.02(a) during the Transitional
Period, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including
the Company following

   

the Closing) to not, directly or indirectly, at any time or in any form or
manner following the Closing in any jurisdiction (i) use any Seller Names or
Marks (including, for the avoidance of doubt, as part of an Internet domain
name, social media handle or company name), (ii) file any application to
register or otherwise seek to register or obtain any rights with respect to
any Seller Names and Marks, or (iii) challenge the ownership, use, validity,
enforceability or register ability of any Seller Names and Marks, and
including, in each case, with respect to clauses (i) through (iii), any
variations or other derivatives of any the foregoing. Without limiting any
other remedies that may be available to Seller or any of its Affiliates,
Seller shall have the right to terminate the Company's rights set forth in
Section 6.02(a) upon written notice to Purchaser, following a ten (10) day
notice and cure period, if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates breaches any of
the terms or conditions set forth in this Section 6.02 or otherwise fails to
comply with any reasonable direction of Seller with respect to the use of any
of the Seller Names and Marks (including any quality standards). Seller
hereby expressly reserves all rights in and to the Seller Names and Marks,
except solely for the limited non-exclusive license granted to Purchaser and
the Company during the Transitional Period. After the Closing, Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to not, hold itself out as
having any affiliation with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 6.03Securities Act. Purchaser shall not sell, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, transfer, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of, the Company Interests in violation of any

Section 6.04Insurance. 

 

(a)Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly provided in
this Section 6.04, the policies and insurance coverage maintained on behalf of
the Company or the Business are part of the corporate insurance program
maintained by Seller and its Affiliates (such policies, the "Corporate
Policies"), such coverage will not be available or transferred to Purchaser or
the Company, Purchaser shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining
replacement coverage for the Company and the Business and none of Seller or
any of its Affiliates shall, subject to the immediately following sentence and
Section 6.4(b), have any liabilities or obligations with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to events or circumstances
arising solely out of the operation or conduct of the Business that occurred
prior to the Closing that are covered by or insured under any occurrence based
policies of any Seller or any of its Affiliates where the Company is an
insured as of immediately prior to the Closing (provided, that between the
date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall not take any action relating to the
Company's status as an insured under the Corporate Policies unless such action
would apply generally to the Company, Seller and its Affiliates), Purchaser
(or the Company, as applicable) may make claims, to the extent such claims (or
the underlying events or circumstances relating to such claims) existed prior
to the Closing, under any such insurance policies to the extent that such
policies are available, and Seller shall, at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser, take any actions reasonably requested by Purchaser and necessary in
connection with tendering such claims to the applicable insurers under such
insurance policies and to provide Purchaser with the proceeds it realizes with
respect to such claims to the extent arising out of the operation or conduct
of the Business prior to the Closing; provided, that Purchaser or the Company
shall exclusively bear (and Seller and its Affiliates shall not have any
obligation to repay or reimburse Purchaser or the Company for) the amount of
any deductibles, retentions, self-insurance or redemption account liability
associated with claims under such policies (and to the extent Seller or any of
its Affiliate pay, incur or otherwise bear any such amounts, Purchaser shall
pay or reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for such amounts), whether such
claims are made by Purchaser or the Company, their respective employees or
third parties,

   

and shall be liable for all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible
amounts of such claims (provided, that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not limit the obligations of Seller under Article XI hereof).

 

(b)Seller and its Affiliates shall retain the exclusive right to control all
of their Corporate Policies and the benefits and amounts payable thereunder,
including the right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or
otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and
programs and to amend, modify or waive any rights under any such insurance
policies and programs, notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs
apply to any claims the Company has made or could make in the future;
provided, that Seller and its Affiliates shall not take any such action unless
such action would apply generally to coverage of claims by the Company and
claims by Seller and its Affiliates; provided, further, that none of Seller or
its Affiliates shall be obligated to indemnify the Company for the exhaustion
of the limits of liability under the Corporate Policies. It is further
understood and agreed that Seller and its Affiliates may cancel or not renew
any of the Corporate Policies at any time, without any liability or obligation
to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company); provided, that
Seller and its Affiliates shall not take any such action unless such action
would apply generally to the Company, Seller and its Affiliates.

 

(c)Other than as expressly set forth in this Section 6.04, Purchaser covenants
and agrees not to seek to assert or to exercise any other rights or claims of
the Company or the Business under or in respect of any past or current
Corporate Policy under which the Company or any Affiliate thereof or the
Business is an additional insured.

 

(d)(i) All obligations of Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section
6.04, and (ii) all rights of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company) pursuant to this Section 6.04, shall
terminate upon the thirty-six (36) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
other than with respect to any claims brought pursuant to this Section 6.04
that remain pending or unresolved as of such date, which obligations or rights
shall survive until the final resolution of such claims.

 

Section 6.05RandW Insurance Policy. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, Purchaser has obtained and bound the RandW Insurance
Policy, and has provided a true, correct and complete copy thereof to Seller.
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates acknowledges and agrees
that: (a) all premiums, underwriting fees, brokers' commissions and other
costs and expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy shall be borne solely
by Purchaser or such Affiliates and (b) none of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates shall amend, waive, modify or otherwise revise the RandW Insurance
Policy in any manner adverse to Seller or its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of Seller.

or otherwise obtain any interest in or agree to acquire, invest in or
otherwise obtain any interest in by merging or consolidating with, or by
purchasing any assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or
portion thereof if the

   

entering into a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such

period, (B) significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Entity
entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions or (C)
delay the consummation of the Transactions.

respective Affiliates to, take any and all actions necessary to make any
Filings and obtain any Authorizations required under or in connection with any

refile it unless Seller has consented in advance in writing to such withdrawal
and refiling or (B) take, or cause to be taken, any action or do, or cause to
be done, anything that would be reasonably likely to delay the grant of any
Authorization or extend any waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to
the Transactions or to cause any Governmental Entity to object to such
Transactions.

 

(v)In the event any Proceeding by a Governmental Entity or other Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the Transactions or
seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate
and use all reasonable efforts to defend against such proceeding and, if an
Injunction or other order is issued in any Proceeding, to use all reasonable
efforts to have such Injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate

or during the twenty four (24) months after the Closing (with respect to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates including the Company), the Company (if
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing) or Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company) is in possession of (i) any funds
(including any refund or other amount relating to any claim (in respect of
workers' compensation, litigation, insurance or otherwise)) arising from any
business of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than the Business or (ii)
any asset (including Intellectual Property) used or held for use in the
conduct of any business of Seller or any of its Affiliates other than
exclusively in the Business, then the Company (if after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing) or Purchaser (if after Closing) shall promptly transfer,
or cause its applicable Affiliate to transfer, such funds or asset to Seller
or its designated Affiliate, for no additional consideration and net of the
Company's or Purchaser's, as applicable, reasonable out-of-pocket costs
incurred to effect such transfer or fulfill its obligation pursuant to the

of its Affiliates to, make or issue any public release or announcement

without the prior written consent of the other of such Parties (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or listing authority,
in which case the Party required to make the release or announcement (or whose
Affiliate is required to make such release or announcement) shall, to the
extent practicable and legally permissible, allow the other of such Parties a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance and the Party issuing such release shall consider any
reasonable comments in good faith; provided, that each of Seller and Purchaser
may

   

make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent
with such Party's prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and that otherwise have been made in
accordance with this Section 7.05. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents following the date hereof and
following the Closing, respectively, shall be in the form mutually agreed upon
by Seller and Purchaser. 

 

Section 7.06Tax Matters.

 

(a)Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully with each other, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
preparation, filing and execution of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding during normal business hours and making employees available
(as reasonably required) on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder or to testify
at any such proceeding, at the cost and expense of the requesting Party.
Seller and the Company agree to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon reasonable
request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain any
certificate or other document from any Taxing Authority or any other person or
(ii) take any other action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Party (including with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) all , at the cost and
expense of the requesting Party. 

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, each of Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing of the proposed assessment
or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
or of any demand or claim with respect to Taxes (each, a "Tax Proceeding"), of
which such party has been informed in writing by any Taxing Authority, which,
if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be
grounds for indemnification under this Agreement. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known to the notifying party) describing
the asserted Liability for Taxes in reasonable detail and shall include copies
of any notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority in respect
of any such asserted Liability for Taxes. In the case of a Tax Proceeding (i)
with respect to the Company that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the
pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, or which, if determined adversely
to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for
indemnification under this Agreement or (ii) with respect to any Seller Tax
Group (in each case, a "Seller Contest"), Seller shall have the right, at its
expense, to control the conduct of such Seller Contest; provided, that in the
case of a Seller Contest with respect to the Company, (i) Seller shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of developments with respect to
such Seller Contest, and (ii) Purchaser shall have the right to participate,
at Purchaser's own expense, in such Seller Contest. For avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall have the sole and exclusive right to control the conduct of any
Seller Contest with respect to any Seller Tax Group, and Purchaser shall have
no right to participate in, or be kept informed of the status of developments
with respect to, any such Seller Contest.

 

(c)Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

 

(i)The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be filed
(taking into

   

account any extensions) on or before the Closing Date. Each such Tax Return
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of the Company
except as required by changes in applicable Law.

 

(ii)Purchaser shall prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed
at Purchaser's expense, all Non-Income Tax Returns of the Company with respect
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period
that are due after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide each such Non-
Income Tax Return to Seller for its review and approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) at least thirty (30)
days prior to the date on which such Non-Income Tax Return is to be filed.
Such Non-Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Company except as required by changes in applicable Law.

 

(iii)Seller shall prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed at
Seller's expense, all Income Tax Returns of the Company with respect to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period that are
due after the Closing Date. Seller shall provide each such Income Tax Return
to Purchaser for its review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which such Income Tax Return is to be filed, provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall have no rights to approve
(i) any consolidated, combined or unitary Income Tax Return to be filed by a
group of which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a member or (ii) any Income
Tax Returns as to which the income, gain, loss or deduction (or items thereof)
of the Company are included or reflected as a disregarded entity. Such Income
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of
the Company except as required by changes in applicable Law.

 

(iv)Without Seller's prior written consent, Purchaser (and its subsidiaries
and Affiliates) shall not take any of the following actions with respect to
Taxes or Tax Returns in each case for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-
Closing portion of any Straddle Period to the extent such action would
increase the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable to indemnify any party
pursuant to Section 7.06(g): (A) amend any previously filed Tax Returns of the
Company; (B) change any Tax election with respect to the Company; (C) extend
or waive any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of
the Company; or (D) initiate discussions or examinations with a Governmental
Entity or Taxing Authority or make any voluntary disclosures with respect to
Taxes.

 

(d)All Transfer Taxes that are imposed on any of the Parties by any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

 

(e)Within 120 calendar days after the determination of the Final Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 1.04(b), Seller shall prepare and provide
Purchaser with a draft of an allocation of the Final Purchase Price, together
with the liabilities of the Company (to the extent applicable for U.S. federal
Income Tax purposes) and any other relevant items (and all other capitalized
costs), among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (the "Allocation"). If Seller does not receive a written objection to the
draft Allocation from Purchaser within thirty (30) days of sending the draft
Allocation to Purchaser, then the draft

   

Allocation will become final and binding on the Parties and their respective
Affiliates. If Seller receives a written objection to the draft Allocation
from Purchaser within thirty (30) days of sending the draft Allocation to
Purchaser, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith to resolve the
dispute. Neither Purchaser, Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall take any Tax position (whether in Tax audits, Tax Returns or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 7.06(e), unless required to do so by applicable Law, and any
subsequent adjustments to the Final Purchase Price shall be reflected in
amendments to the Allocation made in accordance with the principles set forth
in the initial Allocation (as finally determined pursuant to this Section
7.06(e)).

 

(f)Parties acknowledge that the purchase and sale of the Company Interests
pursuant to this agreement is intended to be treated for U.S. federal Income
Tax purposes and any relevant state or local Income Tax purposes as a purchase
and sale of assets. The Parties shall file all Tax Returns in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

(g)Seller shall pay, or shall indemnify and reimburse Purchaser and its
Affiliates for, the amount of (i) any and all Income Taxes of the Company for
all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the pre-Closing portion of any Tax period
beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (such
period being a "Straddle Period") and (ii) any liability for Income Taxes of
any member of any Seller Tax Group (other than the Company) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
non-U.S. Law or regulation, in each case to the extent not otherwise reflected
in the Working Capital adjustment to the Purchase Price. With respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Income Taxes attributable to the pre-
Closing portion of the Straddle Period will be determined on the basis of a
deemed closing of the books and records of the Company as of the Measurement
Time. For claims under this Section 7.06(g), Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall be entitled and required to recover such amounts in the following order:
first, from Seller, up to the amount of any retention then remaining under the
RandW Insurance Policy; then, under the RandW Insurance Policy, to the extent of
available coverage thereunder, and until coverage under the RandW Insurance
Policy has been exhausted; and then from Seller. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Purchaser, its
Affiliates and the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover an aggregate
amount in excess of the Final Purchase Price under this Section 7.06(g) and
Article XI.

 

Section 7.07Restrictive Covenants.

 

(a)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller will not,
and will not permit any of its controlled Affiliates to: (i) directly engage

Company as of the date hereof and during the 12 months prior to the date
hereof, within the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and
Tennessee; (ii) intentionally interfere in any respect with the business
relationships between any customers or suppliers of the Company with respect
to the Business; or (iii) knowingly solicit any customers or suppliers of the
Company for purposes of diverting their business or services from the Company.

 

(b)For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Seller will not, and
will not permit any of its Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) induce
or encourage any Business Employee to leave the employment of Purchaser or any

Employee; provided, that the foregoing clause (ii) shall not

not specifically directed toward any Business Employee or (B) hiring any
Business Employee (x) whose employment has been terminated by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, (y) who responds to any general solicitation made by Seller
or any of its Affiliates not specifically directed toward any Business

initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than general solicitations described in the foregoing clause
(A) or (B)(y)).

 

(c)For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser will not,

Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than general solicitations described
in the foregoing clause (A) or (B)(y)).

 

(d)Each of Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that the restrictions contained in
this Section 7.07 are reasonable and necessary to protect their respective
legitimate business interests (including with respect to the Company) and
constitute a material inducement to enter into this Agreement and consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that any
covenant contained in this Section 7.07 should ever be fully and finally
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the time,
geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable
Law in any jurisdiction, then such court is expressly empowered to reform such
covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to
the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law.

   

Section 7.08Litigation Support. If and for so long as any Party is
prosecuting, contesting or defending any Proceeding, investigation, inquiry,
charge, claim or demand by a third party in connection with any Transaction or
the Company or the Business, the other Parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the other Parties and their respective
Representatives in such prosecution, contest or defense, including making
available its personnel and providing such testimony and access to its books
and records as reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution,
contest or defense, all at the cost and expense of the requesting party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without
limiting any rights or remedies of any Purchaser Indemnitees under Article XI
hereunder, Purchaser hereby agrees, to the extent applicable, to move for
substitution (or take similar actions under applicable Law to achieve a
similar effect) of the Company for Seller or any of its Affiliates that is a

action necessary to cause Seller and each of its Affiliates to be released
from any and all such Proceedings effective as of the Closing.

Agreement (including the items set forth on Section 7.09 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule), and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all Authorizations required to be obtained by the Company pursuant to any
Environmental Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Fees required to be paid to any Governmental Entity by the Company
in connection with submitting such Filings or obtaining such Authorizations
shall be, to the extent not paid prior to Closing, the responsibility of
Purchaser.

 

Section 7.10Notifications. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, (i) Seller and Purchaser shall promptly notify each other of
any change, condition or event that renders or would reasonably be expected to
render any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate to an extent such that a condition set forth in Section 8.01(a)
or 8.02(a), as applicable, would not be satisfied if the Closing were to then
occur and (ii) Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any change, condition
or event that Purchaser believes gives rise to any indemnification obligation
of Seller pursuant to Article XI; provided, that no such notification, nor any
failure to make such notification, shall affect any of the representations,

(b)Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if there has been a breach by
Seller or the Company of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations of such Party set forth herein, which breach would result in the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.01 to be satisfied as of the
Closing and which breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being
cured, has not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) twenty (20) days after
Purchaser has delivered written notice of such breach to Seller and (y) the
Outside Date; provided, that such right of termination shall not be available
at any time that Purchaser is in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations set forth herein, which breach would
result in the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.02 to be
satisfied as of the Closing;

 

(c)Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if there has been a breach by
Purchaser of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or obligations
of Purchaser set forth herein, which breach would result in the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 8.02 to be satisfied as of the Closing and
which breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has
not been cured prior to the earlier of (x) twenty (20) days after Seller has
delivered

   

written notice of such breach to Purchaser and (y) the Outside Date; provided,
that such right of termination shall not be available at any time that Seller
is in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations set forth herein, which breach would result in the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 8.01 to be satisfied as of the Closing;

 

(d)Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other of such Parties, if
the Closing does not occur on or prior to March 28, 2020 (such date, as it may

conditions set forth in (i) Section 8.01(c) and Section 8.02(c) or (ii)
Section 8.01(b) and Section 8.02(b) in connection with Section 8.01(c) and

(e)Seller or Purchaser, upon written notice to the other of such Parties, if
any applicable Law or Injunction issued by a Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Acquisition shall be in
effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that
such right of termination shall not be available to Seller or Purchaser if the
action or inaction of such Party was a significant cause of the issuance of
any such Injunction.

terminated and the Transactions are abandoned as provided in Section 9.01,
then:

 

(a)notwithstanding any provision in the Confidentiality Agreement to the

Material or (ii) otherwise made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates and its
and their respective Representatives by Seller, its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives in connection with the Transactions or any of
the Transaction Documents or relating to the Business, in the case of each of

Affiliate before or after the execution hereof (provided, that Purchaser, and
its Affiliates and their respective representatives, shall not be required to
delete electronic archival copies of such materials); and

 

(b)all confidential information made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives with respect to Seller, its

no further force or effect, except for the provisions of (i) Section 6.01
(Confidentiality), (ii) Section 7.05 (Publicity), (iii) this Article IX
(Termination) and (iv) Article XII (Miscellaneous) and the definitions set
forth in Annex A. Nothing in this Article IX shall be deemed to release
either Seller or Purchaser from any Liability for any Willful Breach by such
party of any provision hereof prior to such termination or to impair the right
of any Party to compel specific performance by the other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement that survive such termination. In the event
a Proceeding to recover damages resulting from any Willful Breach of this
Agreement is brought and the Party bringing such Proceeding is the prevailing
party in such Proceeding, the non-prevailing party shall also pay the costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by
the prevailing Party in such Proceeding.

shall, or Purchaser shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide to each
Transferred Employee to the extent such Person remains employed with the
Company during such Continuation Period, (a) a base salary or wage rate,
variable pay and non-equity incentive or bonus opportunities that in each case
is no less favorable than, and (b) other employee benefits and compensation
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than, in the case of each of
clauses (a) and (b), the base salary or wage rate, variable pay, non-equity
incentive or bonus opportunities and other employee benefits and compensation
provided or available to each such Transferred Employee under the Benefit
Plans or other compensation and benefit plans, programs or arrangements of
Seller or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date (which,
for purposes of health benefit plans, will take into account actuarial value).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Article X,
the compensation, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment for
the Transferred Employees who are covered by a Union Contract shall be
governed by the terms of the applicable Union Contract. Effective as of the
Closing, each Transferred Employee shall cease to participate in any Benefit
Plan as an active employee, and the Company shall terminate its participation
in each Benefit Plan.

 

Section 10.03Severance Obligations. The Company (or other applicable
Affiliate of Purchaser) shall provide to each Transferred Employee whose
employment is terminated by the Company or any of its Affiliates during the

the severance and termination benefits that would have been due to

   

such Transferred Employee under the applicable Benefit Plan providing
severance or termination benefits, the Union Contract, or such other
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of Seller or any
of its Affiliates, with respect to the arrangements set forth on Section 10.03
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
taking into account and including the service and compensation of such
Transferred Employee with respect to his or her employment with Purchaser and
its Affiliates following the Closing Date. The foregoing shall only apply to
the extent such severance or termination benefits are set forth on Section
10.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, with reasonably specificity in order
for Purchaser to calculate the applicable severance or termination benefit so
payable.

 

Section 10.04Welfare Plan and COBRA Obligations.

 

(a)Without limiting the generality of Section 10.02, effective as of the
Closing Date, the Company shall, or the Purchaser shall cause its Affiliates
to, have in effect health and welfare benefit plans providing benefits to the
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents effective as of the
Closing Date and without any waiting period. Seller and its Affiliates (other
than the Company) shall have no obligation under Section 6055 and 6056 of the
Code with respect to any obligation of the Company, or any offers of coverage
made to the Transferred Employees, for any period of time as of or following
the Closing Date.

 

(b)Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company shall be solely
responsible for any and all obligations arising under COBRA with respect to
all "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9 and for any and all obligations to provide continuation coverage
for current Business Employees and Former Business Employees and their
dependents who are "qualified beneficiaries" under COBRA or who are eligible
to receive or are receiving continuation coverage under COBRA as of the
Closing under the applicable Benefit Plans of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 10.05Service Credit. From and after the Closing and with respect to
each Transferred Employee, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall (a) recognize,
for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and
accruals) under all plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements
that are sponsored by or may be established or maintained by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company) on or after the Closing Date
("Purchaser Benefit Plans"), service with Seller and its Affiliates and
predecessors earned prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was
recognized under a corresponding Benefit Plan or to the extent such service
was required to be covered by the applicable Union Contract, (b) waive any
pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement, evidence of
insurability, waiting period or similar condition, limitation or requirement
under all Purchaser Benefit Plans that provide health and other welfare
benefits, except to the extent such pre‑existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such Transferred Employee
under the corresponding Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (c) provide full credit under all Purchaser Benefit Plans that provide
health benefits for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or
incurred under a Benefit Plan with respect to each Transferred Employee (and
each eligible dependent of such Transferred Employee) prior to the Closing
Date for the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 

Section 10.06Accrued Vacation; Paid Time Off. Except as otherwise required
under applicable Law, as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to honor all vacation days and paid time off (including sick time)
accrued but not yet taken by each Transferred Employee prior to the Closing
Date.

 

Section 10.07Bonuses. Purchaser shall cause the Company to make any and all
payments required to be made with respect to,

   

compensation payable in respect of any Transferred Employee (whether relating
to periods before or after the Closing Date) under any Benefit Plan that is a
variable pay, bonus, cash performance or incentive plan and that is set forth
on Section 10.07 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, including compensation
that is accrued and payable with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 10.08Union Contracts.

 

(a)Following the Closing, any employee benefit that is required pursuant to
any Union Contract (except as specifically provided in this Article X, other
than in respect to benefits accrued and vested as of the Closing under any
Benefit Plan) shall instead be provided pursuant to an employee benefit plan
maintained by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates.

 

(b)Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, render full good faith
cooperation to Seller and its Affiliates, and Seller shall render full
cooperation to Purchaser and its Affiliates, in each case in any negotiations
with or requests for information by, unions or employee representatives that
are required or initiated to accomplish the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 10.09401(k) Plan. Without limiting the generality of Section 10.02,
effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, have in effect a defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of
the Code (the "Purchaser 401(k) Plan") providing benefits as of the Closing
Date to the Transferred Employees. Purchaser agrees to cause the Purchaser
401(k) Plan to allow each Transferred Employee to make a "direct rollover" to
the Purchaser 401(k) Plan of the account balances of such Transferred Employee
(excluding promissory notes for any outstanding loans) under the Benefit Plan
that is a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code. 

 

Section 10.10No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Article X
are solely for the benefit of the Parties and nothing in this Article X,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Business Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any
third-party beneficiary right or any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Article X, nothing in this Article X, express or implied,
shall be construed to prevent Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from
terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any benefit plan that
Purchaser or any such Affiliate may establish or maintain. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Article X to the contrary, the terms of this Article X
are not intended to, and shall not, constitute an amendment or modification to
any benefit plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement. Nothing in this Agreement modifies the at-will
employment relationship of any Business Employee.

 

Article XI 

INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL

 

Section 11.01General Indemnification by Seller. 

 

(a)Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Article
XI, from and after the Closing, Seller shall (without duplication with respect
to any other payment made pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Purchaser
against, and hold it harmless from, any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense, including reasonable, documented third party legal fees and expenses
(collectively, "Losses") suffered or incurred by Purchaser, its Affiliates
(including the Company after the

   

Closing) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Purchaser
Indemnitees") (other than any Losses related to Taxes, for which
indemnification is provided under Section 7.06), to the extent arising or
resulting from the following (if and only to the extent that a Purchaser
Indemnitee provides written notice of such breach (which notice shall describe
the applicable breach in reasonable detail, include copies of all available
material written evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitee in connection therewith) to Seller prior to
the Fundamental Representation Survival Date or the General Representation
Survival Date, as applicable:

 

(i)any breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation in this Agreement;

 

(ii)any breach of any Seller General Representation in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such breaches arising or occurring
from and after the date hereof, and up to and including the Closing, which are
known to or discovered by Purchaser prior to the Closing (and are as such
excluded or excepted from coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy), but which
do not result in a failure of Purchaser's conditions to Closing under Section
8.01(a), to the extent applicable to the Seller General Representations); and

 

(iii)the matters set forth on Section 11.01(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.01(a),
Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnitee and shall
not have any liability under this Section 11.01 to the extent (i) any Loss
arose in connection with any action taken or omitted to be taken by a
Purchaser Indemnitee (except to the extent such act or omission reflects the
continuation, in all material respects, of the pre-Closing practices of the
Company, or is an action taken to mitigate a Loss as provided herein), or (ii)
any Loss arose in connection with any breach of a representation and warranty
or covenant made or to be performed by Purchaser under this Agreement.

 

(c)Except for (i) any specific enforcement or equitable remedy to which a
Party is entitled pursuant to Section 12.11 or (ii) claims of, or causes of
action arising from, Fraud, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other
Purchaser Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the
Closing with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XI. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser, for itself and on behalf of the
Purchaser Indemnitees, their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, members, managers, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Waiving
Parties"), hereby irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, including by contractually shortening the applicable statute
of limitations, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than those expressly contained in clauses (i) and (ii)
of the immediately preceding sentence) that it or the Purchaser Waiving
Parties may have against Seller, its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, partners, members, managers, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnity Parties") relating to the operation of the Company or the Business
or relating to the

   

subject matter of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or the
Transactions, whether arising under, or based upon, any Law (including any
right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek indemnification,
contribution, cost recovery, damages or any other recourse or remedy,
including as may arise under common law or the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act or any other Environmental Law), in
each case, except pursuant to this Article XI. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 11.01(c) shall in any way impair the rights
and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to resolve disputes with respect to
the Statement and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 1.04, and the fact that Purchaser may have the right to pursue a claim
for indemnification under this Article XI with respect to any facts or
circumstances shall not operate to impair the application of Section 1.04 in
accordance with its terms; provided, however, that in no event shall Purchaser
be entitled to receive indemnification for Losses to the extent that the
amount of any item is actually reflected in the calculation of Working
Capital, Funded Debt or Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses and therefore
actually reflected in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

 

Section 11.02General Indemnification by Purchaser.

 

(a)Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Article
XI, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall (without duplication with
respect to any other payment made pursuant to this Agreement) indemnify Seller
against, and hold it harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by Seller,
its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") to the extent arising resulting from any breach of (i) any
Purchaser Fundamental Representation in this Agreement or (ii) any Purchaser
General Representation in this Agreement, but if and only to the extent that a
Seller Indemnitee provides written notice of such breach (which notice shall
describe the applicable breach in reasonable detail, include copies of all
material written evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the
applicable Seller Indemnitee in connection therewith) to Purchaser prior to
the Fundamental Representation Survival Date or the General Representation
Survival Date, as applicable.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.02(a),
Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnitee and shall
not have any liability under this Section 11.02 to the extent (i) any Loss
arose in connection with any action taken or omitted to be taken by a Seller
Indemnitee, or (ii) any Loss arose in connection with any breach of a
representation and warranty or covenant made or to be performed by Seller
under this Agreement.

 

(c)Except for (i) any specific enforcement or equitable remedy to which a
Party is entitled pursuant to Section 12.11 or (ii) claims of, or causes of
action arising from, Fraud, Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Indemnitee, agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing with
respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XI. In furtherance
of the foregoing, Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Indemnitee, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than those expressly contained in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence) that it or any Seller
Indemnitee may have against Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Affiliates arising
under, or based upon, this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or the
Transactions, in each case, except pursuant to this Article XI.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 11.02(c)
shall in any way impair the rights and obligations of Purchaser and Seller to
resolve disputes with respect to the Statement

   

and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.04, and
the fact that Seller may have the right to pursue a claim for indemnification
under this Article XI with respect to any facts or circumstances shall not
operate to impair the application of Section 1.04 in accordance with its
terms.

 

Section 11.03Limitations; Calculation of Losses; Mitigation. 

 

(a)Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any Losses pursuant to Section
11.01(a)(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of the Purchaser
Indemnitees' Losses under Section 11.01(a)(ii) exceeds the Deductible, after
which Seller shall only be obligated with respect to Losses of the Purchaser
Indemnitees in excess of the Deductible (subject to the other limitations set
forth herein); provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud.

 

(b)Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any Losses pursuant to Section
11.01(a)(ii) in excess of the General Indemnity Amount; provided that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims of, or causes of action arising
from, Fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges, understands
and agrees that, except for claims of, or causes of action arising from,
Fraud, the sole source of recovery for the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect
to any Losses in excess of the General Indemnity Amount due to breaches of any
Seller General Representations in this Agreement shall be the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 

(c)The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article XI shall be net of any and all amounts actually recovered by the
indemnified party under any insurance policies or otherwise (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy
or contractual indemnities of another Person which are contained outside this
Agreement) with respect to such Loss (and the indemnified party shall use
reasonable best efforts to make such recovery, and shall refund to the
indemnifying party any subsequent recovery made with respect to any Loss
previously paid or reimbursed by the indemnifying party hereunder); and such
Losses shall further be reduced to take account of any Tax benefit realized as
a result of the incurrence or payment of the applicable Loss as a reduction in
cash Taxes paid by the indemnified party (or, in the case of Purchaser, the
Company) and increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred by the
indemnified party as a result of the receipt of any indemnification payment
hereunder, determined on a with and without basis.

 

(d)For the avoidance of doubt (and provided that the following limitations
shall not apply to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud) for
claims by a Purchaser Indemnitee under Section 11.01(a)(i), the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall be entitled and required to recover such amounts in the
following order: first, from Seller, up to the amount of any retention then
remaining under the RandW Insurance Policy; second, under the RandW Insurance
Policy, to the extent coverage is available thereunder and until coverage
under the RandW Insurance Policy has been exhausted; and third, from Seller.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Purchaser Indemnitees be
entitled to recover an aggregate amount in excess of the Final Purchase Price
under Section 7.06(g) and this Article XI.

   

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or provided under
applicable Law, (i) Losses arising or resulting from any breach of any Seller
General Representation or any Seller Fundamental Representation shall not
include Losses that are in the nature of punitive, special, treble or indirect
damages, in each case of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action
through which any of the foregoing are sought and (ii) Losses arising or
resulting from any matters other than any breach of any Seller General
Representation or any Seller Fundamental Representation shall not include
Losses that are in the nature of punitive, consequential, special, treble or
indirect damages or damages based on any multiple, including business
interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business
reputation or opportunity, in each case of any kind or nature, regardless of
the form of action through which any of the foregoing are sought, in each case
of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), except to the extent any such Losses
are awarded and paid by an indemnified party with respect to a Third Party
Claim.

 

(g)Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party or a
Seller Indemnitee or Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder, including by using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) resolve any such claim or liability and
(ii) mitigate any Loss for which indemnification is sought under this
Agreement; provided, however, that the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of such
mitigation shall constitute Losses for purposes of this Agreement. In the
event that Purchaser or Seller shall fail to use such commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability, then notwithstanding
anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other Party shall not be
required to indemnify any Person for any Losses that would reasonably be
expected to have been avoided if Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, had
made such efforts.

 

(h)For purposes of determining any breach of any Seller Fundamental
Representation or any Seller General Representation, and for purposes of
determining the amount of Losses arising or resulting therefrom, any
materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or other similar qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such provisions shall be disregarded;
provided that with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
(i) Section 2.15(a) (Absence of Changes), such qualifications shall not be
disregarded for purposes of determining any breach thereof but shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Losses arising or
resulting from a breach of such representations and warranties, and (ii)
Section 2.06 (No Undisclosed Liabilities), such qualifications shall not be
disregarded for any purpose.

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to any Losses pursuant to Section
11.01(a)(i) or Section 11.01(a)(ii) if, with respect to any individual item of
Loss or a series of related Losses, such item is less than $20,000 ("Minor
Claim"); provided, however, that Minor Claims shall count against the
Deductible.

 

Section 11.04Tax Treatment of Indemnification. Any indemnity payment under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 11.05Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless any party pursuant to Section 11.01(a) or Section 11.02(a) shall
terminate when the applicable Seller Fundamental Representation, Seller
General Representation, Purchaser Fundamental Representation or Purchaser
General Representation, as

   

applicable, terminates pursuant to Section 11.07; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to
any item as to which the Person to be indemnified shall have, before such
applicable expiration date, previously made a good faith claim by delivering a
notice of such claim in writing (which notice shall describe the applicable
breach in reasonable detail), include copies of all available material written
evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the applicable indemnified
party in connection therewith) pursuant to Section 11.06 to the party to be
providing the indemnification; and provided further, that such limitation
shall not apply to claims of, or causes of action arising from, Fraud. 

 

Section 11.06Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a)Third Party Claims. In order for a Person (the "indemnified party") to be
entitled to any indemnification provided for under Section 11.01 or Section
11.02 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any third
Person against the indemnified party (a "Third Party Claim"), such indemnified
party must notify the party required to provide indemnification therefor (the
"indemnifying party") in writing (which notice shall describe the applicable
breach in reasonable detail, include copies of all available material written
evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of Losses that have been or may be sustained by the applicable indemnified
party in connection therewith) of the Third Party Claim within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
within five (5) Business Days after the indemnified party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third Party Claim.

 

(b)Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party; provided that the indemnifying party shall not have
the right to assume the defense thereof where (1) the defendants in any such
action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the
indemnified party has reasonably concluded based on the advice of counsel that
there are legal defenses available to it which are different from, additional
to or inconsistent with those available to the indemnifying party, or (2) it
is reasonably likely that the losses or damages arising or resulting from such
Third Party Claim will exceed the amount the indemnified party will be
entitled to recover from the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement;
provided, further, notwithstanding the forgoing proviso, Seller shall have the
absolute right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim related to the
matters on Section 11.01(a) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule. Should the
indemnifying party so elect in writing to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, and so long as the indemnifying party thereafter continues to
diligently defend such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred
by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the indemnifying
party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in
which the indemnified party shall

   

have failed to give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If
the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all
the indemnified parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to testify and provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying party's prior written consent. If the indemnifying party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim and which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
indemnifying party shall not, without prior written consent of the indemnified
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim on a basis that would result in (i) injunctive or other nonmonetary
relief against the indemnified party, including the imposition of a consent
order, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct
of the indemnified party or (ii) a finding or admission of fault or misconduct
by the indemnified party. 

 

(c)Other Claims. In the event any indemnified party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 11.01 or Section 11.02 that does
not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be
collected from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall reasonably
promptly deliver written notice of such claim (which notice shall describe the
applicable breach in reasonable detail as then known to the indemnified
party), include copies of all available material written evidence thereof and
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Losses that have
been or may be sustained by the applicable indemnified party in connection
therewith) to the indemnifying party. Subject to Section 11.05, this Section
11.06 and Section 11.07, the failure by any indemnified party to so notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 11.01 or Section
11.02, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. 

 

(d)Tax Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the event of a conflict between this Article XI and Section 7.06(g), Section
7.06(g) shall control.

 

Section 11.07Survival of Representations and Covenants. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive
the Closing as follows: (a) the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
Purchaser Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until the
earlier of six (6) years following the Closing Date and the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (each such applicable date, a "Fundamental
Representation Survival Date"); (b) the Seller General Representations and the
Purchaser General Representations shall survive the Closing until such date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "General Representation
Survival Date"); (c) the covenants and agreements of the Company and Seller
that do not contemplate performance following the Closing contained in this
Agreement shall not survive the Closing; and (d) the covenants and agreements

   

set forth in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed in whole
or in part at or after the Closing shall survive the Closing to the extent
provided by their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, except
for (i) claims for Fraud with respect to making the representations and
warranties set forth in Article II and Article III of this Agreement (as
qualified by the Seller Disclosure Schedule), (ii) claims for indemnification
pursuant to and subject to the limitations of (x) Section 7.06(g) or (y) this
Article XI and (iii) claims for specific performance or other equitable
remedies hereunder, no claim shall be brought or maintained by, or on behalf
of, any Purchaser Waiving Parties against any Seller Indemnity Party, and no
recourse shall be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or
based upon, any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any
of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company,
Seller or any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement, any
certificate, instrument, opinion, agreement or other document of the Company,
Seller or any other Person delivered hereunder, the subject matter of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or the Transactions, the Business or the
ownership, operation, management, use or control of the Business, any of the
assets, or any actions or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 11.07,
Section 11.02(c) and the representations and warranties contained in Section
4.08 are an integral part of the Transactions and the inducement of Seller to
consummate the Transactions.

 

Section 11.08Elevator Indemnity. Without limiting anything in this Article
XI, following the Closing, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for 50% (on a
dollar-for-dollar basis) of Purchaser's reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
costs and expenses required to repair or replace the Firing Building Elevator
and the Lime Kiln Dust Silo Elevator (the "Elevator Indemnity"), upon
Purchaser's prompt written notification to Seller of such repair or
replacement (which written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail
the services provided, the costs of repairs or replacement and other expenses
for which Purchaser is seeking reimbursement under the Elevator Indemnity and
shall include all supporting material related to such claims, including copies
of invoices related to such costs and expenses, and such notice shall be
provided not later than thirty (30) days after completion of such repair or
replacement) (the "Elevator Indemnity Notice"); provided that the maximum
aggregate amount reimbursable by Seller under this Section 11.08 shall be
$460,000 (the "Elevator Indemnity Cap") and neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to reimburse Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates under this Section 11.08 for any amount in excess of the Elevator
Indemnity Cap; provided, further, that Seller shall have no obligations under
this Section 11.08 and Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek or receive any
amounts under the Elevator Indemnity if Purchaser fails to timely provide the
Elevator Indemnity Notice to Seller; provided, further, that Seller shall have
no further obligations with respect to the Elevator Indemnity following the
Elevator Indemnity Termination Date. The Elevator Indemnity, and any and all
obligations of Seller related thereto, shall terminate on the earliest of (a)
with respect to each of the Firing Building Elevator and the Lime Kiln Dust
Silo Elevator, the date on which the repairs or replacement as are necessary
to put such elevators in good working order following the Closing are
completed (provided that, if Purchaser timely provides Seller with the
Elevator Indemnity Notice, Seller shall still be obligated to pay such amounts
owed in connection with the Elevator Indemnity up to the Elevator Indemnity
Cap but, for the avoidance of doubt, shall have no obligations thereafter),
(b) the one year anniversary of the Closing Date or (c) the date on which
Seller has reimbursed Purchaser in respect of the Elevator Indemnity in an
aggregate amount equal to the Elevator Indemnity Cap (the earliest to occur
with respect to the Firing Building Elevator or the Lime Kiln Dust Silo
Elevator, as applicable, the "Elevator Indemnity Termination Date"). For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount that Purchaser

   

contributes toward such repair or replacement of either the Firing Building
Elevator or the Lime Kiln Dust Silo Elevator shall not count toward the
Deductible and the amount that Seller contributes toward such repair or
replacement of either the Firing Building Elevator or the Lime Kiln Dust Silo
Elevator shall not count toward the General Indemnity Amount. For purposes of
this Section 11.08, the term "Purchaser" shall include the Company.

hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. In the event of an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

 

Section 12.07Disclosure Schedules. Seller and the Company have set forth
certain information and other matters in the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and
Purchaser has set forth certain information in the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, in each case, in a section thereof that corresponds to the Section,
or a portion of such Section, to which it relates. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if the relevance of any item, information or other
matter set forth in any section of any Disclosure Schedule to any other
section of such Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent, then such item,
information or other matter shall be deemed to be disclosed against such other
section of such Disclosure Schedule, regardless of whether such item,
information or other matter is actually set forth (by cross-reference or
otherwise) in such other section of such Disclosure Schedule. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the inclusion of any item, information or other
matter in any Disclosure Schedule that is not required by this Agreement to be
so included is solely for the convenience of the other Party, (b) the
disclosure by any Party of any item, information or other matter in any

disclosed by the terms of this Agreement, (c) each Disclosure Schedule is
qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this
Agreement, (d) the Disclosure Schedules and the information and other matters
contained therein are not intended to broaden or constitute, and shall not be
construed as broadening or constituting, representations, warranties or
covenants of any Party except as and to the extent provided in this Agreement,
(e) disclosure of any item on any Disclosure Schedule shall not constitute or
be deemed an admission or indication that such item or matter is material or
would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and shall not imply a measure
for materiality for purposes of this Agreement, and (f) no disclosure on a
Disclosure Schedule relating to a possible breach or violation of any Contract
or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that a breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred.

 

Section 12.08Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when each Party has executed such a counterpart and delivered it to
the other Parties. Delivery by a Party of an executed signature page of this

   

Agreement by facsimile, email or other electronic imaging means shall be as
effective as delivery by such Party of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

 

Section 12.09Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement and
understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject
matter.

 

Section 12.10Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any applicable Law or
public policy, all other provisions of this Agreement, and the application of
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision to any Person or circumstance
other than that with respect to whom or which it was held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic and legal substance of the Transactions is not affected
in any manner that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 12.11Specific Performance; Limitation on Liability.

 

(a)The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any Party does not perform its obligations under this
Agreement (including by failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with the applicable
terms and conditions hereof or otherwise breaches any provision hereof.

 

(b)The Parties acknowledge and agree that, (i) prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, each Party shall be entitled
to an Injunction or Injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 12.12(a), without proof
of damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which it is
entitled under this Agreement or at law or in equity and (ii) the right of
specific performance described in this Section 12.11(b) is an integral part of
the Transactions and, without such right, no Party would have entered into
this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Parties hereby
further acknowledge and agree that each Party shall be entitled to specific
performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to
prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed by any
other Party under, this Agreement (including Section 7.01) and to cause such
other Party to consummate the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by
this Agreement (including Article I), in addition to any other remedy to which
any Party is entitled at law or in equity, including the Company's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article IX.

 

(c)Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an Injunction or
Injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that
such other Party has an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.

 

(d)The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an Injunction or
Injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
12.11 shall not be required to post any bond or other security in connection
with any such Injunction or Injunctions.

   

(e)If, prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Outside Date and (ii) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, any Party brings
any Proceeding in accordance with Section 12.12 to prevent any breach of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the provisions hereof, the Outside Date
shall be automatically extended by (A) the amount of time during which such
Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (B) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such Proceeding, as the case
may be.

 

Section 12.12Consent to Jurisdiction.

 

(a)Each Party hereby (i) agrees that any Proceeding arising out of, under or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether directly or
indirectly, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment rendered in such
a Proceeding, will be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware (and each Party agrees that no such Proceeding relating to this
Agreement will be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such
court), subject to any appeal; provided, that, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction over such a Proceeding,
then such Proceeding may be brought in any Delaware state court or any federal
court located in the State of Delaware, and (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any
such Proceeding.

 

(b)Each Party further agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by United States registered mail to such Party's address set forth in
Section 12.05 shall be effective service of process on such Party for any
Proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction in this Section 12.12.

 

(c)Each Party, on behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Affiliates,
hereby (i) irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions in any court referenced in Section 12.12(a), (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that
any such Proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and (iii) agrees that a final judgment in any such
Proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

 

Section 12.13WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. EACH
PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.13.

 

Section 12.14GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN

   

UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

 

Section 12.15Conflicts. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has acted as
legal counsel to Seller, its Affiliates and the Company prior to the Closing,
and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and
its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company) after the Closing,
each of Purchaser and the Company hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees
to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection
with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Seller and/or its Affiliates after the
Closing as such representation may relate to Purchaser, the Company or the
Transactions. In addition, Purchaser agrees that all communications prior to
the Closing among Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Seller, its Affiliates or the
Company and all attorney work product that in either case relate to the
Transactions (collectively, the "Protected Information"), the attorney-client
privilege, the expectation of client confidence, all attorney work product
protections and all similar protections belong to Seller and may be controlled
by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Company. The
Protected Information is the property of Seller, and from and after the
Closing, none of the Company, or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or
through the Company, will seek to obtain such communications or work product,
whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or work product
protection or through other means. The Protected Information may be used by
Seller, and/or any of its Affiliates in connection with any dispute that
relates in any way to the Transactions and the Company and Purchaser shall
have no right to use or rely on the Protected Information. Further, the
Company shall not have access to any Protected Information, or to the files of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to its engagement, whether or not the Closing
shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (a) Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Company)
shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to
such engagement, and the Company shall not be a holder thereof, (b) to the
extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement
constitute property of the client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the
Company) shall hold such property rights and (c) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Company by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Company or otherwise.
