Conversion; The Contribution and Unit Issuance; The Class B Common Stock
Issuance_.

(a) _The Holdco Charter Amendment and the Impax Merger_.

 

(i) On the Closing Date, at the Closing, Holdco shall file with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of Holdco in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Amended and Restated Holdco Charter_ "), which shall be the certificate of
incorporation of Holdco immediately following the Closing until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (the " _Holdco
Charter Amendment_ "). Prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall
take all actions necessary to amend and restate the bylaws of Holdco (as in
effect immediately prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time) in their entirety
as set forth on _Exhibit B_ (the " _Amended and Restated Holdco Bylaws_ "),
effective as of immediately prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time, which
shall be the bylaws of Holdco immediately following the Closing until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. As set
forth in the Amended and Restated Holdco Charter, the name of Holdco shall
be "Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc."

 



2 (ii) On the Closing Date, following the Holdco Charter Amendment, Impax
and Merger Sub shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed
in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ ") in order to effect the Impax Merger. The Impax Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time on the
Closing Date as is agreed among the parties and specified in the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (such date
and time is referred to herein as the " _Impax Merger Effective Time_ ").

(iii) At the Impax Merger Effective Time, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with Section 251 of
the DGCL, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Impax, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Impax will continue its
existence as the surviving corporation in the Impax Merger and a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Holdco (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 

(iv) The Impax Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Impax Merger Effective Time, the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and all of the assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company, in each
case as provided under the DGCL.

 

(b) _LLC Conversion_.

 

(i) Subject to _Section 1.01(b)(iv)_, on the Closing Date, following the
Impax Merger Effective Time and prior to the Contribution, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ "), the
Surviving Company shall be converted from a Delaware corporation to a
Delaware limited liability company (the " _LLC Conversion_ ").

(ii) Subject to  _Section 1.01(b)(iv)_, on the Closing Date, Impax shall
file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of
conversion (a " _Certificate of Conversion_ ") and a certificate of formation
(a " _Certificate of Formation_ "), executed in accordance with, and
containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and the DLLCA to effect the LLC Conversion. The LLC Conversion shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Conversion and
Certificate of Formation has been filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such other, later time on the Closing Date as is
agreed among the parties 

 



3  and specified in the Certificate of Conversion and Certificate of Formation
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA;
_provided_ , that such time must be after the Impax Merger Effective Time and
prior to the effective time of the Contribution (such date and time is
referred to herein as the " _Conversion Effective Time_ ").

 

(iii) At the Conversion Effective Time (if it occurs), (i) the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company, each in effect at the
Conversion Effective Time, will be replaced and superseded in their entirety
by the Certificate of Formation and the Limited Liability Company Agreement of
the Surviving Company, in the forms set forth on  _Exhibit C_ and _Exhibit
D_, respectively, (ii) Holdco, as the sole stockholder of the Surviving
Company immediately prior to the LLC Conversion, will execute the Limited
Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Company and be admitted to the
Surviving Company as the sole member of the Surviving Company, and (iii) all
of the shares of stock of the Surviving Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the LLC Conversion will be converted to all of
the limited liability company interests in the Surviving Company.

(iv) Notwithstanding this _Section 1.01(b)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, the LLC Conversion shall not be effected and _Sections
1.01(b)(i)-(iii)_ and _Section 1.04(b)_ shall be disregarded if Amneal
provides written notice to Impax prior to the Closing Date that the LLC
Conversion shall be eliminated as a Transaction, such that the Contribution
(as defined herein) and the Unit Issuance shall occur immediately following
the Impax Merger.

 

(c) _The Contribution and Unit Issuance_.

 

(i) On the Closing Date, following the Conversion Effective Time and
simultaneously with the execution of the Restated Amneal LLC Operating
Agreement, subject to _Section 1.01(b)(iv)_, Holdco will contribute all of
the outstanding equity interests of the Surviving Company to Amneal (the "
_Contribution_ ") in exchange for the issuance (the " _Unit Issuance_ ") by
Amneal to Holdco of a number of newly issued Amneal Units equal to the
aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock of Holdco, par value $0.01
(" _Class A Common Stock_"), issuable pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_.

(ii) The parties hereto shall cause the Contribution and the Unit Issuance to
be consummated on the Closing Date after the Conversion Effective Time and
simultaneously with the execution of the Restated Amneal LLC Operating
Agreement (subject to _Section 1.01(b)(iv)_) by executing the Contribution
Agreement (in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_). The
Contribution and the Unit Issuance shall become effective at such time on the
Closing Date as specified in the Contribution Agreement; _provided_ , that
such date and time must be after the Conversion Effective Time, subject to
_Section 1.01(b)(iv)_ (such date and time is referred to herein as the "
_Contribution Effective Time_ ").

 



4 (iii) In connection with the Contribution and the Unit Issuance, each of
Holdco and the Existing Amneal Members will execute the Restated Amneal LLC
Operating Agreement, the Recapitalization (as defined in the Restated Amneal
LLC Operating Agreement) will be completed and Holdco will be admitted as the
managing member of Amneal. The aggregate number of Amneal Units to be issued
to the Existing Amneal Members in connection with the Recapitalization shall
equal three _times_ the Fully Diluted Impax Share Number. Such Amneal Units
shall be allocated among the Existing Amneal Members in accordance with the
terms of the Amneal LLC Operating Agreement as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Closing (as determined by the Amneal Group Representative in its
sole discretion); _provided_ , that immediately following the
Recapitalization, each Existing Amneal Member shall transfer such Amneal Units
to the Amneal Group Representative (and the schedule of members to the
Restated Amneal LLC Operating Agreement shall be updated accordingly). 

__(d) _The Class B Common Stock Issuance_. On the Closing Date, following the
Contribution Effective Time and in consideration of the Recapitalization,
Holdco will issue to each Existing Amneal Member an aggregate number of shares
of Class B common stock of Holdco, par value $0.01 per share (" _Class B
Common Stock_" and together with the Class A Common Stock, " _Holdco Common
Stock_ "), equal to the number of Amneal Units held by such Existing Amneal
Member immediately following the Recapitalization. __

 

Section 1.02 _Transaction Structure_. Each party hereto shall, if requested by
any other party hereto to implement any reorganization transactions or
implement any changes to the structure of the Transactions, consider such
reorganization transactions or transaction structure changes in good faith and
cooperate with the other party to the extent it determines in good faith that
such reorganization transactions or transaction structure changes are
advisable and will not (a) have an adverse impact on such party or its equity
holders, (b) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to
be received by any of its or any of its equity holders in connection with the
Transactions, (c) have an adverse effect on the Tax consequences of the
Transactions to it or its equity holders or (d) materially impede or delay
consummation of the Transactions. Any such changes to the structure of the
Transactions that are agreed upon by the parties shall be set forth in writing

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock of Impax and Merger Sub_. At the Impax
Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Impax Merger and without any action
on the part of Impax, Holdco, Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of Impax
Common Stock:

__(a)  _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock of
Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time shall be converted into one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company, par
value $0.01 per share. __

__(b) _Cancellation of Certain Impax Common Stock_. Each share of Impax
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Impax Merger
Effective Time that is owned or held by Impax in treasury, by Amneal or by any
of their respective Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "),
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. __

 

 __(c) _Conversion of All Other Impax Common Stock_. Each share of Impax
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Impax Merger
Effective Time, other than any Cancelled Shares, shall be converted into the
right to receive one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A Common
Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). __

 



6 Section 2.02 _Effect on Holdco Common Stock_. At the Impax Merger Effective
Time, each share of Holdco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

Section 2.03 _Exchange of Impax Certificates and Impax Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Amneal to act as
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the
aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.03_. At or
immediately following the Impax Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect of (i) certificates that immediately prior to the
Impax Merger Effective Time represented shares of Impax Common Stock ("
_Impax Certificates_ ") and (ii) non-certificated outstanding shares of Impax
Common Stock represented by book entry (" _Impax Book-Entry Shares_ "), in
each case other than Cancelled Shares, for exchange in accordance with this
_Section 2.03_ through the Exchange Agent (collectively, the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant
to _Section 2.01(c)_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Impax Merger Effective
Time, Holdco shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of an Impax Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Share, in each case
which shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration in
respect thereof at the Impax Merger Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement:
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Impax Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Impax Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Impax, Amneal and
the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Impax Certificates or Impax Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof, as
applicable. Upon surrender of Impax Certificates and Impax Book-Entry Shares
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all required enclosures and
attachments, with respect to such Impax Certificates or Impax Book-Entry
Shares, the holder of such Impax Certificates or Impax Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Impax
Common Stock formerly represented by such Impax Certificates or such
Impax Book-Entry Shares. Any Impax Certificates and Impax Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of any Merger
Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name
any surrendered Impax Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
precedent to payment that the Impax Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration
in respect thereof, as applicable, to a person other than the registered
holder of the 

 



7  Impax Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of Holdco that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Delivery of the aggregate Merger Consideration, as
applicable, with respect to Impax Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
person in whose name such Impax Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Impax Certificate or Impax Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Impax Merger Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration in
respect thereof.

 

 __(c) _Transfer Books_. At the Impax Merger Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Impax shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Impax Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time on the records of Impax.
From and after the Impax Merger Effective Time, the holders of Impax
Certificates and Impax Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Impax Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Impax Merger
Effective Time, Impax Certificates representing shares of Impax Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof as
provided in this Agreement. __

__(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property_. At any time
following one (1) year after the Closing Date, Holdco shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Holdco Common Stock
remaining in the Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and
not delivered to holders of Impax Certificates or Impax Book-Entry Shares,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Holdco (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration payable upon due
surrender of their Impax Certificates or Impax Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in this _Section 2.03_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Holdco nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of an Impax Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Shares for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. __

 

 __(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Impax
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Impax Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to 
_Section 2.01(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco or the Exchange Agent
may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment
of such aggregate Merger Consideration, require the owners of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Impax Certificates to deliver a customary indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Holdco, the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Impax Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed. __

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the Impax Merger Effective Time with
respect to Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Impax Merger
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Impax
Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Share with respect to the 

 



8  shares of Class A Common Stock issuable in respect thereof unless and until
the holder of such Impax Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Share shall surrender
such Impax Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Share. Subject to the effect of
escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Impax
Certificate or Impax Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid by Holdco to the
holder of whole shares of Class A Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Impax Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Impax Merger Effective Time but prior to surrender and
a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Class A Common Stock.

Section 2.04 _Treatment of Impax Equity Awards; Impax ESPP_.

 

(a) No later than immediately before the Impax Merger Effective Time, Impax
and Holdco shall take such actions as may be required to provide that each
Impax Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Impax Merger
Effective Time shall, at the Impax Merger Effective Time, fully vest (to the
extent unvested) and shall be exchanged for an option to acquire a number of
shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Impax Common
Stock subject to such Impax Option immediately before the Impax Merger
Effective Time at a price per share equal to the exercise price per share of
Impax Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Impax Option (each
Impax Option as so adjusted, an " _Exchanged Impax Option_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such conversion shall be effected in accordance with Section
424(a) of the Code;  _provided_ , _further_ , that, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.04(a)_, each such Exchanged Impax Option
exchanged pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ shall continue to have, and
shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Impax Option immediately prior to the Impax Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _further_ , that such Exchanged Impax Options shall remain
exercisable following the Impax Merger Effective Time until such Exchanged
Impax Option expires in accordance with its terms.

(b) No later than immediately before the Impax Merger Effective Time, Impax
and Holdco shall take such actions as may be required to provide that each
Impax Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Impax
Merger Effective Time shall, at the Impax Merger Effective Time, fully vest
and shall be exchanged, subject to any required Tax withholding with respect
to such vesting (each Impax Restricted Share as so adjusted, an " _Exchanged
Impax Restricted Share_ "), for one share of Class A Common Stock
in accordance with _Section 2.01(c)_.

(c) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Impax Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other necessary actions such that (A) all Purchase Periods (as such term is
defined in the Impax ESPP) shall terminate and each participant shall be
deemed to have elected to purchase the number of shares of Impax Common Stock
calculated in accordance with the terms of the Impax ESPP upon the earliest to
occur of (x) December 31, 2017, (y) the day that is four (4) complete trading
days prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time or (z) the date on which such
Purchase Period(s) would otherwise end, (B) no individual participating in the
Impax ESPP shall be permitted to,

 



9  except to the extent required by applicable Law, make separate non-payroll
contributions to the Impax ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement,
and (C) the Impax ESPP will terminate no later than immediately prior to the
earliest to occur of (i) December 31, 2017 and (ii) the Impax Merger Effective
Time.

(d) At the Impax Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall assume all the
obligations of Impax under the Impax Stock Plans and each Exchanged Impax
Option and the agreements evidencing the grants thereof.

 

Section 2.05 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the Impax Merger
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Impax Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the number of Amneal Units to be received by the Existing Amneal Members in
connection with the Recapitalization (as reflected in the Restated Amneal LLC
Operating Agreement) and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the Existing Amneal Members the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits under any Impax Plan, (iv) result in any obligation to fund any trust

its Subsidiaries under any Impax Leases or, to Impaxs Knowledge, any other

Liabilities and (d) with respect to any real property currently owned or
leased by Impax or its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Impax, formerly
owned or leased by Impax or its Subsidiaries, there have been no Releases by

person, of Hazardous Materials that have resulted or are reasonably likely to
result in a claim against Impax or its Subsidiaries.

 

Section 3.19 _Labor Matters_. No labor strike, work slowdown, work stoppage,
lockout or other concerted labor action or dispute involving the employees of
Impax or any of its Subsidiaries is pending, or to the Knowledge of Impax,
threatened against or affecting Impax or any of its Subsidiaries and, since
January 1, 2014, there has not been any such action. Neither Impax nor any of
its Subsidiaries is party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar

with any labor organization applicable to employees of Impax or any of

expected to have, individually or

 



33  in the aggregate, an Impax Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2014,
each of Impax and its Subsidiaries has been continuously insured with
recognized insurers or has self-insured, in each case in such amounts and
with respect to such risks and losses as are required by Law and any Contract
to which it is a party and as are customary for companies in the United States
conducting the businesses conducted by Impax and its Subsidiaries, except
where such failure has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

Impax Plans, since January 1, 2014, there has been no transaction, or series
of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor are

opinion of Morgan Stanley to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion
and based on and subject to the various assumptions, procedures, matters,
qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan
Stanley as set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders
of Impax Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares) pursuant to this Agreement
is fair from a financial point of view to such holders of Impax Common Stock,
and a complete copy of such written opinion will be made available to Amneal,
solely for informational purposes, as soon as practicable after the date of

Ancillary Agreements, the Transactions or the Ancillary Transactions.

Impax is a party or by which it is otherwise bound.

 

Section 3.27 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The only vote of holders of any
class or series of Impax Common Stock or other equity interest of Impax
necessary to approve the Transactions is the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the Impax Common Stock outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon (the " _Impax Stockholder Approval_ "). No other vote of the
holders of Impax Common Stock or any other equity interests of Impax is
necessary to consummate the Transactions.

engaging in the Transactions and the Ancillary Transactions contemplated
hereby and, prior to the Closing, Holdco will not have engaged in any other
business activities other than incidental to the Transactions and the

Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Amneal and
the Amneal Material Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (except to the extent the "good standing" concept is not

in which it is formed and has all requisite corporate, limited liability
company or other entity power and authority to carry on its business as now

Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is formed and has all requisite
limited liability company or other entity power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except to the extent that any failure to be

Material Adverse Effect. Amneal and each of its Subsidiaries is duly

jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, an Amneal Material Adverse Effect. Amneal has, prior to
the date hereof, made available to Impax a true and complete copy of the
certificate of formation of Amneal, the Amneal LLC Operating Agreement and the
charter and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the
Amneal Material Subsidiaries, in each case as amended to the date of this

such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned directly or indirectly by Amneal free and clear of any Liens

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which Amneal is a party, and the consummation of the
Transactions and the Ancillary Transactions, do not and will not conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without

offers to buy from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect of any

or any applicable state securities Laws.

or authorization of, action by or in respect of, or registration, declaration

agreement with any labor organization or any work rules or practices agreed
to with any labor organization applicable to employees of Amneal or any of its
Subsidiaries (each such agreement, an " _Amneal Labor Agreement_ "), and no
collective bargaining or similar agreement is currently being negotiated by
Amneal or any of its Subsidiaries. The execution and delivery of this

any labor organization or Governmental Authority) to any payments under any
of the Amneal Labor Agreements, and each of Amneal and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respect with their obligations pursuant to all
notification and bargaining obligations arising under any Amneal Labor

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Amneal Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2012, each of Amneal and its Subsidiaries has
been continuously insured with recognized insurers or has self-insured, in
each case in such amounts and with respect to such risks and losses as are
required by Law and any Contract to which it is a party and as are customary
for companies in the United States conducting the businesses conducted by
Amneal and its Subsidiaries, except where such failure has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an

and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any
discussions or negotiations with any persons that are ongoing with respect to
any Competing Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal. Except as permitted by
this  _Section 5.02_, until the earlier of the Impax Merger Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_, not
(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission

Promptly, and in any event no later than one Business Day following the date
of this Agreement, Impax shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished in connection with a
potential Competing Proposal to any person with whom Impax or any of
its Representatives has had discussions or negotiations with respect to a
Competing Proposal in the last twelve (12) months and shall terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such person
or its Representatives.

__(b) _Provision of Information and Notice of a Competing Proposal_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.02_,
if at any time prior to (but not after) Impax obtaining the Impax Stockholder
Approval, (i) Impax has received a bona fide written Competing Proposal that
has not resulted from a material breach of this _Section 5.02_, (ii) the
Impax Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (iii) the Impax Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary _ _

 



69  duties to the stockholders of Impax under applicable Law, then Impax may,
subject to compliance with this _Section 5.02_, (A) furnish information with
respect to Impax and any Subsidiaries of Impax to the person making such
Competing Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the person making such Impax Competing Proposal and its
Representatives regarding such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Impax (1) will not, and will not permit or authorize its Subsidiaries or
any Representative of Impax or its Subsidiaries to, disclose any information
to such person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such person and (2) will as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter) provide or make available to Amneal any
material information concerning Impax or any Subsidiary of Impax provided or
made available to such other person (or its Representatives) that was not
previously provided or made available to Amneal. Subject to the undertakings
of the Confidentiality Agreement, Impax will promptly (and in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Amneal in the event Impax, any Subsidiary of Impax or
any of its Representatives receives (x) notice by any person that such person
intends to make a Competing Proposal, (y) any inquiry or request for
information or for discussions or negotiations from which it is apparent that
such inquiry or request is being made in contemplation of or in preparation
for a Competing Proposal or (z) a Competing Proposal, and shall (I) indicate,
in connection with such notice, the identity of the person making such
inquiry or Competing Proposal, requesting such information or seeking to
initiate such discussions or negotiations, together with a summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal (including, if
applicable, copies of any written inquiry, notice, request or Competing
Proposal) or the nature of the request for information, as applicable, and
(II) thereafter keep Amneal reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and terms of any such discussions or
negotiations. Impax shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into any agreement with any person that prohibits Impax from providing to
Amneal any of the information required to be provided to Amneal under this
_Section 5.02(b)_ within the time periods contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.02_, the Impax
Board may correspond in writing with any person making a Competing Proposal
solely to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, provided that such
written correspondence is delivered concurrently to Amneal. Impax shall not
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, grant permission under,
any "standstill," confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement to which Impax
is a party, and Impax shall enforce the provisions of each such agreement;
_provided_ , that Impax shall be permitted to fail to enforce any provision of
any "standstill," confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement if the Impax
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Impaxs stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Impax promptly advises Amneal that it is taking such action
and the identity of the party or parties with respect to which it is taking
such action.

_Section 5.02(f)_, neither the Impax Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) authorize, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to
authorize, approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Competing Proposal,
(ii) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Impax Board Recommendation
or any other approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Impax Board or any such committee of this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, (iii) fail to

 



70  include the Impax Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
(iv) adopt, approve or recommend or otherwise declare advisable a Competing
Proposal, (v) submit any Competing Proposal or any matter related thereto to
the vote of the stockholders of Impax or (vi) announce its intention,
authorize, commit, resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (each
action set forth in clauses (i) through (v) of this _Section 5.02(c)_, a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ").

__(d) _Entry Into a Competing Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to (but not after)
obtaining the Impax Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with
_Section 8.02(a)(iii)_ and this  _Section 5.02(d)_, the Impax Board may:
(i) make a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal or
(ii) cause Impax to enter into a Competing Proposal Agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)(ii)_, if (A) there has been no material breach of this _Section
5.02_, (B) a bona fide, written Competing Proposal is made to Impax and/or its
stockholders by a third person, (C) the Impax Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and after complying with _Section 5.02(e)_, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (D) the Impax Board determines
in good faith after consultation with Impaxs outside legal counsel that the
failure to take any of the actions referred to in either of clause (i) or (ii)
above would violate the fiduciary duties owed by the Impax Board to the
stockholders of Impax under applicable Law. __

__(e) _Matching Rights With Respect to Superior Proposal_. Neither Impax nor
the Impax Board shall take any of the actions described in _Section
5.02(d)(i)_ or _Section 5.02(d)(ii)_ unless Impax provides Amneal ninety six
(96) hours prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a "
_Notice of Superior Proposal Action_ "), which notice shall include the
identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and, if applicable, shall attach the
proposed Competing Proposal Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that, in each case, neither the delivery of such notice by Impax
nor any public announcement thereof that the Impax Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, is required to be made under
applicable Law shall constitute a Change of Recommendation), (y) to the extent
requested by Amneal, Impax negotiates in good faith with Amneal with respect
to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Amneal for at least
ninety six (96) hours following delivery by Impax of such Notice of Superior
Proposal Action (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
any material term of any Competing Proposal will be deemed a new Competing
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.02(e)_, including with respect to
the notice period referenced in this _Section 5.02(e)_, except that the
ninety six (96)-hour period shall be reduced to seventy two (72) hours for
such purposes) and (z) taking into account any binding changes to the terms of
this Agreement definitively and irrevocably agreed to by Amneal in writing,
the Impax Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes definitively
and irrevocably agreed to by Amneal in writing were to be given effect. For
the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentences of this _Section 5.02(e)_
shall apply to each Competing Proposal that triggers a Notice of Superior
Proposal Action. __

 



71 __(f) _Intervening Event Unrelated to Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to
(but not after) the time the Impax Stockholder Approval is obtained, solely in
respect of an Intervening Event, the Impax Board may make a Change of
Recommendation other than in connection with a Competing Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation proposed to be made in
connection with a Competing Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 5.02(d)_) only if (i) Impax has provided Amneal
ninety six (96) hours prior written notice of the occurrence of an Intervening
Event and its intention to consider making a Change of Recommendation (a "
_Notice of Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall include a
description of such Intervening Event in reasonable detail (it being agreed
that neither the delivery of such Notice of Change of Recommendation by Impax
nor any public announcement thereof that the board of directors of Impax
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, is required
to be made under applicable Law shall constitute a Change of Recommendation),
(ii) Impax has negotiated in good faith with Amneal with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Amneal for at least ninety
six (96) hours following delivery by Impax of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation and (iii) taking into account any binding changes to the terms
of this Agreement definitively and irrevocably agreed to by Amneal in writing,
the Impax Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Impax Board
under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any such Change of Recommendation made
pursuant to this _Section 5.02(f)_, unless this Agreement is otherwise
terminated in accordance with its terms, consistent with Section 146 of the
DGCL, Impax shall submit this Agreement to the stockholders of Impax for their
consideration at the Impax Stockholder Meeting. __

 

(g) _No Effect on Duty to Disclose_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit Impax or the Impax Board from
(i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable United States
federal or state Law with respect to a Competing Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of Impax a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of Impax if the Impax Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Impax under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that this _Section
5.02(g)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Impax Board to make a Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.02(d)_ or
_Section 5.02(f)_ (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the
issuance by Impax or the Impax Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders) shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation).

(h) _Breach_. Impax agrees that any breach or violation of, or non-compliance
with, this _Section 5.02_ by any Representative of Impax or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf of
Impax or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Agreement by Impax.

 



72 ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.01 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Amneal and
Impax shall jointly prepare, and shall cause Holdco to file with the SEC the
Registration Statement, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
constituting a part thereof, and each of Amneal and Impax shall promptly
furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates as may be
reasonably requested by the other party and shall otherwise reasonably assist
and cooperate with the other in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Registration Statement. Each of Amneal and Impax will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when filed, to comply in all
material respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii) respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received
from the SEC or its staff concerning the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (iii) have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and
(iv) keep the Registration Statement effective for so long as necessary to
complete the Transactions.

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or response to SEC comments with respect
thereto, will be made by Amneal or Impax, as applicable, without the others
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon. Impax will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act (but in
no event earlier than the record date set by Impax for the Impax Stockholder
Meeting).

 

(c) Amneal or Impax, as applicable, will promptly notify the other upon the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and will, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other with copies of all material correspondence between
it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
and all written comments with respect to the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus received from the SEC and advise the other on any
oral comments with respect to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus received from the SEC. Impax will advise Amneal, promptly
after Holdco receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement and the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or
the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Class A Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Impax Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, and Amneal and Impax will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated.

(d) Impax and Amneal will also use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take any other action required to be taken under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the Transactions.
If at any time prior to the Impax Merger Effective Time any

 



73  information relating to Amneal or Impax, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Amneal or Impax which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents
would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and
each of Amneal and Impax shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information to be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to Impax Stockholders.

 

Section 6.02 _Impax Stockholder Meeting_. Impax shall take all action
necessary under applicable Law to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the " _Impax Stockholder Meeting_ ") for purposes of
adopting this Agreement and thereby approving the Transactions, including the
Impax Merger, which shall be held as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Impax
shall not, without the consent of Amneal (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), adjourn or postpone, cancel, recess or
reschedule, the Impax Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , that Impax may,
without the consent of (but after consultation with) Amneal, adjourn or
postpone the Impax Stockholder Meeting (i) if, as of the time for which the
Impax Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Impax Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of the Impax Stockholder Meeting, (ii) if the failure to
adjourn or postpone the Impax Stockholder Meeting would reasonably be expected
to be a violation of applicable Law or for the distribution of any required
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or (iii) to solicit
additional proxies if Impax reasonably determines that it is advisable or
necessary to do so in order to obtain the Impax Stockholder Approval. Except
to the extent that the Impax Board shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation, Impax shall include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the
Impax Board Recommendation. Promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Impax shall (i) cause Holdco, in its capacity as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, to approve the Impax Merger and (ii) approve, in
its capacity as the sole stockholder of Holdco, the Contribution, in each case
in accordance with applicable requirements of the DGCL and Impax shall deliver
evidence of such approvals to Amneal promptly following the date of this
Agreement.

Section 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Each of Impax
and Amneal shall afford to the other and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours during the period from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period,
and each of Impax and Amneal shall furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
such party during such period and not publicly available pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (b) consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning the party and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the other party or any of
its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any applicable Law
or any Contract to which it is a party, requires it to restrict access to any
properties or information or in order to maintain attorney-client or other
privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that in any such case, the

 



74  parties shall cooperate to seek to provide for access in a manner that does
not violate any such Law or Contract or attorney-client or other privilege.
Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement, dated April 12, 2017, between APHC and Impax (as it may
be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each of
Impax and Amneal shall hold, and shall cause its Representatives to hold, all
information received from the other party, directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with and otherwise subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.03_ or information
provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this Agreement will affect
or be deemed to modify any of the representations or warranties of Impax or
Amneal contained in this Agreement or the conditions hereunder to the
obligations of the parties hereto.

Section 6.04 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Transactions, subject to the express provisions of
this Agreement (including the provisions of _Section 5.02_), including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all
acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making
of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an adverse action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority (including in connection with
the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Laws), (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the party subject to the applicable requirement
of a Governmental Authority or party to the applicable agreement requiring a
consent or waiver shall be primarily responsible for communications with the
applicable Governmental Authority or other third party and the other party
hereto shall reasonably cooperate in such efforts. In connection with and
without limiting the first sentence of this _Section 6.04(a)_, each of Impax
and the Impax Board, Holdco and the Holdco Board, and Amneal and the Amneal
Board shall (A) take no action to cause any state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation to become applicable to this Agreement or the
Transactions and (B) if any state takeover statute or similar statute is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Transactions, take all action
reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement and the Transactions.

 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each party hereto
shall make or cause to be made any appropriate filings, if necessary or
advisable, pursuant to the HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws with
respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement
with respect to filings under the HSR Act, unless otherwise mutually agreed
between the parties). Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other
such necessary information and

 



75  reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority and to
any requests for additional information at the earliest practicable date,
including promptly informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in
advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental
Authority and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence,
filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement. Such information can be shared on an
outside counsel basis or subject to other restrictions to the extent deemed
necessary or advisable by counsel for the disclosing party. To the extent
practicable and as permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto
shall permit Representatives of the other party to participate in material
substantive meetings (whether by telephone or in person) with such
Governmental Authority. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts and
closely collaborate on the timing, strategy and approach to (x) obtain any
consents, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by
Amneal or Impax or any of their respective Subsidiaries under the HSR Act or
other applicable Competition Laws, (y) avoid the entry of any judgment in any
claim asserted in court by any Governmental Authority under any Competition
Laws that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing or (z) contest or avoid
any action, proceeding or litigation by any Governmental Authority under the
HSR Act or other applicable Competition Laws.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.04(a)_ or 
_Section 6.04(b)_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
require either party to agree to, or take any action if such efforts or
action, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
results of operations of Amneal, Impax or the combined company (immediately
following the Closing) (each of such actions, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").
None of the parties nor any of its respective Subsidiaries shall take any
action that has the effect of, or agree with any Governmental Authority to,
any Burdensome Condition without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto.

 

Section 6.05 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Impax and Amneal shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to,
the current and former directors and officers of Impax, Holdco and their
respective Subsidiaries (the " _Impax Indemnified Parties_ ") and the current
and former members of the Amneal Board and officers of Amneal and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Amneal Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, including to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL or the DLLCA
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which a
corporation or limited liability company may indemnify its officers and
directors or any Impax Indemnified Party or Amneal Indemnified Party, from and
against any and all costs or expenses (including attorneys fees, expenses
and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any circumstances, developments or matters
in existence, or acts or omissions occurring or alleged to occur at or prior
to the Closing (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
the approval of this Agreement, the performance of Impaxs, Holdcos and
Amneals obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions or arising out of or pertaining to the Transactions) whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing.

 



76 (b) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation existing in favor of each present and former
director, officer and employee of Impax, Holdco, Amneal or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as provided in the Impax Charter, Impax Bylaws, the
Amended and Restated Holdco Charter, the Amended and Restated Holdco Bylaws,
Amneal LLC Operating Agreement or the charter or organizational documents of
the Subsidiaries of Impax, Holdco or Amneal, in each case as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, or under any other agreements in effect on the date
of this Agreement (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
delivered, as applicable, by Impax and Amneal to Amneal and Impax,
respectively), will survive the Transactions and Impax, Holdco and Amneal
will (i) continue in full force and effect for a period of at least six (6)
years from the Closing Date (or, if any relevant claim is asserted or made
within such six (6) year period, until final disposition of such claim) such
rights to indemnification and expense advancement and (ii) perform, in a
timely manner, Impaxs, Holdcos or Amneals or their respective Subsidiaries
obligations with respect thereto. Any claims for indemnification and
expense advancement pursuant to such agreements and organizational documents
as to which Impax, Holdco or Amneal has received written notice before the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date will survive, whether or not those
claims will have been finally adjudicated or settled, and no action taken
during such period may be deemed to diminish the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.05(b)_.

 

(c) For at least six (6) years after the Closing, Impax shall maintain (and
Holdco shall cause Impax to maintain) in effect Impaxs current directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Closing (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions) covering the Impax Indemnified Parties currently covered by
Impaxs directors and officers liability insurance policy (a true and
complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to Amneal), on terms
with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Impax may substitute therefor a tail policy or policies of Impax containing
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such Impax
Indemnified Parties. The covenants contained in this _Section 6.05(c)_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Impax Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal
Representatives, and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Impax Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract or otherwise.

 

(d) For at least six (6) years after the Closing, Amneal shall maintain (and
Holdco shall cause Amneal to maintain) in effect Amneals current directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Closing (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions) covering the Amneal Indemnified Parties currently covered by
Amneals directors and officers liability insurance policy (a true and
complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to Impax), on terms
with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



77  that Impax may substitute therefor a tail policy or policies of Amneal
containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such
Amneal Indemnified Parties. The covenants contained in this _Section
6.05(d)_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Amneal Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal
Representatives, and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which an Amneal Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract or otherwise.

Section 6.06 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

Section 6.07 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Closing, Amneal and Impax
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any securities exchange or securities
quotation system. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release to
be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore
agreed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Amneal and Impax may, without the prior
consent of the other party, reasonably disseminate information with respect to
the Transactions to the extent such information was previously included in a
press release or other public statement made pursuant to this _Section 6.07_.

 

Section 6.08 _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement or the Transactions is brought, or, to
the Knowledge of Impax or Amneal, threatened in writing, against Impax or the
members of the Impax Board prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly
notify the other party of any such stockholder litigation brought, or, to
the Knowledge of such party, threatened against Impax and/or members of the
Impax Board and shall keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to
the status thereof. Neither Impax nor any Subsidiary or Representative of
Impax shall settle or agree to settle any such stockholder litigation or
consent to the same unless Amneal shall have consented in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditional or delayed).

 

Section 6.09 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual, level and
entitlement, with respect to any benefit plan, program or arrangement (other
than any defined benefit pension plan, retiree medical program or other
retiree welfare benefit program), Impax and Amneal shall, and, from and after
the Closing, Holdco shall cause Impax and Amneal to, recognize (or with
respect to any insured arrangement, use commercially reasonable efforts to
recognize) the service of individuals who are employed by Impax and its
Subsidiaries, or Amneal and its Subsidiaries, immediately prior to the Closing
and who remain employed thereafter by Impax, Amneal or any of their
Subsidiaries (the " _Affected Employees_ ") to the same extent as such service
was taken into account under the corresponding Impax Plan or Amneal Plan for
those purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such recognition shall not
result in a duplication of benefits.

 



78 (b) With respect to any welfare plan in which Affected Employees are eligible
to participate after the Closing, Holdco shall, and shall cause Impax and
Amneal to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as
to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the
extent such conditions were satisfied (or not applicable) under the applicable
welfare plans prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each such employee with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior
to the Closing and in the applicable plan year in which the Closing occurs in
satisfying any analogous co-payment deductible or out-of-pocket requirements.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the consummation of the Transactions shall,
to the extent applicable, constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes of each Impax Plan set
forth on _Section 6.09(c)_ of the Impax Disclosure Letter. Following the
Closing, Holdco shall assume each Impax Plan set forth on _Section 6.09(c)_
of the Impax Disclosure Letter.

(d) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date, Amneal and Impax shall cooperate in good faith to take any reasonable
actions determined necessary and appropriate with respect to the Amneal Plans
and the Impax Plans that are each intended to constitute a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _401(k) Plan_
") (including, without limitation, termination of any such 401(k) Plan or
merger of such 401(k) Plans on or prior to the Closing Date). To the extent
that Amneal and Impax cannot in good faith agree on any such actions, whether
to take any or all such actions shall be determined by a committee made up of
those certain individuals that are expected to constitute the Compensation
Committee of the Holdco Board on or prior to the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, it is expected that such committee shall be comprised of
two members appointed by Amneal and two members appointed by Impax.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.09_ shall be treated as an establishment of,
amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or shall limit the
right of Holdco and its Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
Impax Plan or Amneal Plan following the Closing Date. The provisions of this
_Section 6.09_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this _Section 6.09_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Affected Employee or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other
person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any
employee or beneficiary of such employee or other person under an Impax Plan
or Amneal Plan that such employee or beneficiary or other person would not
otherwise have under the terms of that Impax Plan or Amneal Plan.

Section 6.10  _Cooperation_. Each party and its Subsidiaries will, and will
cause each of its Representatives to, use its commercially reasonable efforts,
subject to applicable Law, to cooperate with and assist the other party in
connection with planning the post-Closing integration of the parties and

79 Section 6.11 _Financing_.

 

(a) (i) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Amneal shall use
reasonable best efforts (and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary or advisable to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions, described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the
terms of the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing, (B) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive
Agreements_ ") consistent in all material respects with the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any related
"flex" provisions) or on other terms not less favorable, in the aggregate, to
Amneal than the terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions)
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter but only to the extent that any
such other terms would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact or delay
in any material respect the ability of Amneal to consummate the Transactions
and the Ancillary Transactions in accordance with this Agreement or obtain
the Debt Financing (it being agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Amneal may modify, supplement, amend or amend and restate the Debt Commitment
Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities (and make incidental or conforming amendments or
modifications to reflect the addition of any such lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities), (C) satisfy (or obtain
a waiver of) all conditions within its control to obtaining the Debt Financing
and (D) upon satisfaction of all of the conditions in this Agreement to
Amneals and Impaxs obligations to effect the Closing, and satisfaction of
all of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, enforcing its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, if any,
including to require such parties to provide the Debt Financing.

 

(ii) Amneal shall not, without the prior written consent of Impax, (A) permit
any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of, any provision or remedy
under, or replace (except as expressly set forth under _Section
6.11(a)(iii)_), the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification,
waiver or replacement (1) would add any new (or expand any existing)
condition to the Debt Financing Commitments, (2) reduces the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (3) would
reasonably be expected to adversely impair the ability of Amneal to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, or
(4) would reasonably be expected to prevent or in any material respect impede
or delay the consummation of the Debt Financing (the items described in the
preceding clauses (A)(1) through (4) (and subject to exclusions set forth
below), collectively, the " _Restricted Debt Commitment Amendments_ "), or (B)
terminate the Debt Commitment Letter unless such Debt Commitment Letter
is replaced with another commitment letter or comparable financing commitment
that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Restricted Debt
Commitment Amendment; _provided_ , that the existence or exercise of the
"flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter shall not constitute a
Restricted Debt Commitment Amendment; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Amneal
may modify, supplement, amend or amend and restate, or waive any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or
waiver is not a Restricted Debt Commitment

 



80  Amendment, it being understood that any modification, supplement, amendment
or amendment and restatement solely to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities (and make incidental or
conforming amendments or modifications to reflect the addition of any such
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities)
shall not be a Restricted Debt Commitment Amendment. Upon any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Financing Commitments in accordance with this _Section 6.11(a)(ii)_, the
terms "Debt Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing" and "Debt Financing
Commitments" shall mean, other than for purposes of the representations and
warranties made as of the date of this Agreement in _Section 4.25_, the Debt
Commitment Letter and Debt Financing Commitments, respectively, as so
amended, modified, waived or replaced. Any material consent, approval,
agreement or determination required or contemplated to be made by Amneal under
the Debt Commitment Letter shall be made in reasonable consultation with
Impax. Amneal shall promptly furnish Impax with copies of any marketing
materials, rating agency presentations, information memoranda or any other
documents or communications prepared or received by Amneal or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Debt Financing Commitments, including any
material drafts or final versions of definitive documentation with respect
thereto (other than any internal documents prepared by Amneal or any of its
Subsidiaries and not distributed to lenders or their counsel or any other
third party). In addition, (i) Amneal shall provide Impax and its outside
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any material drafts
of any documents related to the Debt Financing Commitments prior to
the dissemination of such documents to any third parties (it being understood
that any such comments will be considered in good faith by Amneal, subject to
its reasonable discretion) and (ii) keep Impax fully informed at all times of
its efforts to arrange, and the status of, the Debt Financing.

(iii) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments (as
such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of, and
within the limits of, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter),
regardless of the reason therefor, Amneal shall (A) promptly notify Impax of
such unavailability and (B) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly
as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative financing
(" _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Debt Financing that is available, to pay the Required Amount
from the same or other sources (1) on terms not less favorable, in
any material respect, when taken as a whole, to Amneal and Impax than those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and with lenders reasonably
satisfactory to Amneal and (2) that does not contain any other terms that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or in any material respect impede or
delay the consummation of the Transactions and the Ancillary Transactions or
otherwise constitute a Restricted Debt Commitment Amendment. For the purposes
of this Agreement, other than for purposes of the representations and
warranties made as of the date hereof in _Section 4.25_, the terms "Debt
Commitment Letter", "Debt Financing" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall be
deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar agreement), debt
financing or commitment with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and the Debt Commitment Letter, Debt Financing and Debt
Financing Commitment remaining in effect at the time in question), and all
references to the Debt Financing Sources shall include the persons providing
or arranging such alternative debt financing.

 



81 (iv) Amneal shall provide Impax with prompt written notice of (A) any
breach or default by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements, if any, of which Amneal has Knowledge or any
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter of which Amneal has Knowledge, (B)
the receipt of any notice or other communication from any Debt Financing
Source with respect to (1) any actual or threatened breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Definitive Agreements, if any, or any provision thereof, and (2) any dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Definitive Agreements that would reasonably be expected to result in the
unavailability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date or reasonably
be likely to delay or impede the Closing, or (C) any change or event that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition precedent of the Debt Financing (or any Alternative Financing
obtained in accordance with this _Section 6.11_) to not be satisfied or
waived on or prior to the Closing Date and result in the unavailability of the
Debt Financing in the amounts contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (it
being understood that in no event will Amneal be obligated to disclose any
information the disclosure of which would result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege).

 

(v) Nothing in this _Section 6.11_ or any other provisions of this Agreement
shall require, and in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of Amneal
be deemed or construed to require, Amneal to (A) except as expressly set forth
in _Section 6.11(a)(iii)_ with respect to alternative financing, seek or
accept Debt Financing on terms less favorable in the aggregate than those set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the "flex" provisions thereof)
provided on the date of this Agreement, (B) waive any term or condition of
this Agreement or (C) pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments (whether to secure waiver of any conditions
contained therein or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt, Amneals
obligations and responsibilities under this  _Section 6.11(a)_ shall only
apply to the Debt Financing and shall not apply to any debt financing
arrangements to be negotiated by Amneal in the event it desires to propose
changes to the terms of this Agreement in connection with the procedures
contemplated by _Sections 5.02(e)_ or _5.02(f)_.

(b) (i) Impax shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, provide (A) the cooperation listed below in clauses (A),
(B), (D) and (E) with respect to any Amneal Equity Secondary and (B)
customary cooperation as reasonably requested by Amneal in connection with the
Debt Financing, including by using reasonable best efforts to:

 

(A) upon reasonable prior notice, and after reasonable consultation, make

Secondary,

 



82 (B) to cause its independent auditors to cooperate with due diligence matters
in connection with the Debt Financing or any Amneal Equity Secondary,

(C) upon reasonable request, identify any material non-public information

of such information) and provide customary authorization letters
in connection with any marketing materials related to the Debt Financing,

information),

(G) furnish Amneal and the Debt Financing Sources no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all documentation and other

prior to the Closing Date that is required in connection with the Debt
Financing by U.S. regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot
Act of 2001, or that are required by Section 6 of Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letter,

(H) facilitate the pledging of collateral in connection with the
Debt Financing, and

(I) obtain and deliver executed Payoff Letters and instruments of termination

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) such requested cooperation shall not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of Impax or any of its
Subsidiaries; (B) neither Impax nor any of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee in connection with the
Debt Financing prior to the Closing; (2) have any liability or obligation
under any agreement or any document related to the Debt Financing until the
Closing occurs; (3) be required to incur any liability that is not expressly
provided for in this  _Section 6.11_ in connection with the Debt Financing

or its Subsidiaries under any document, agreement or any other contract
relating to the Debt Financing shall be operative prior to the Closing; and
(C) notwithstanding the above, all corporate, limited liability or other
organizational actions shall be deemed to become effective only if and when
the Closing occurs and shall be derived exclusively from the authority of, and
shall only be taken by, the board of directors of Impax and its Subsidiaries
or other governing body of Impax and its Subsidiaries as constituted after
giving effect to the Closing.

(iii) Amneal shall indemnify and hold harmless Impax and its Subsidiaries,
and their respective officers, employees and Representatives, from and against
any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith,
except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of or result from (i)
the willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of Impax and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) historical information furnished in writing by or
on behalf of Impax and its Subsidiaries expressly for inclusion in any
marketing materials. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article
VIII_, Amneal shall, promptly upon request by Impax, reimburse Impax and its
Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documents out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Impax and its Subsidiaries (including those of its Affiliates and
Representatives) in connection with taking action required or requested by
Amneal pursuant to this _Section 6.11_. 

(iv) Impax hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos shall be used
solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage Impax and its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of Impax
and its Subsidiaries.

 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the provisions contained in this  _Section 6.11_ represent the sole
obligation of Impax, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing and no other provision of this Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Disclosure Letters hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify
such obligations.

 



84 (c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding Impax or
its Subsidiaries obtained by Amneal or its Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 6.11_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Amneal and its Representatives may provide such
information to their financing sources (including the Debt Financing Sources),
potential sources of capital, and to rating agencies and prospective lenders
and investors during marketing of the Debt Financing, subject to customary
confidentiality arrangements with such persons regarding such information.

Section 6.12  _Stock Exchange Delisting and Deregistration_. Impax and Amneal
will cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the

Market and the deregistration of such shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable following the Closing in compliance with applicable
Law.

 

Section 6.13 _New York Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing, Impax
and Amneal shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Class A
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Holdco Share Issuances to be
approved for listing on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AMRX (or if such

respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (ii) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from
the NYSE or its staff concerning the NYSE Listing Application and (iii) have

Listing Application, or response to NYSE comments with respect thereto, will
be made by Amneal or Impax, as applicable, without the others prior consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Amneal or Impax, as applicable, will promptly notify the other upon
the receipt of any comments from the NYSE or any request from the NYSE for

with the Holdco Share Issuances for listing on the NYSE, subject only to
official notice of issuance.

 

Section 6.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, Impax and Holdco
shall take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
cause any dispositions of Impax Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Impax Common Stock) or acquisitions of Holdco Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Holdco Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Impax or Holdco, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. 

 



85 Section 6.15 _ISRA Compliance_. Amneal and Impax acknowledge that the
Transactions, including additional actions that may be contemplated to occur
after the Closing, may require the parties thereto or their subsidiaries to
comply with ISRA. If it is determined that ISRA compliance is required for the
Transactions contemplated under this Agreement, each of Impax and Amneal
shall provide to the other party documentation reasonably acceptable to the
other that is sufficient to establish that the Closing complies with the
requirements of ISRA, which may include, for any of the subject facilities,
either (i) a Response Action Outcome (as defined by ISRA) letter, (ii) a
NJDEP-approved de minimis quantity exemption under N.J. Admin Code §7.26B-5-9,
(iii) an NJDEP-approved Remediation in Progress Waiver (as defined by ISRA),
or (iv) a remediation certification, with a Remediation Funding Source (as
defined by ISRA). If a remediation certification has been filed for any ISRA
subject facilities, the Subsidiary that is the owner, lessee or operator of
the facility (or appropriate Amneal entity, as mutually agreed to by the
parties) shall be designated as the responsible party for all future actions
necessary to comply with ISRA. Amneal and Impax shall reasonably cooperate
with all actions taken by the other party or its Subsidiaries in furtherance
of their ISRA obligations under this _Section 6.15_, including but not
limited to signing any required certifications or submissions to NJDEP. If it
is determined that ISRA compliance will be required for any post-closing
actions, each of Impax and Amneal shall cooperate and cause its Subsidiaries
to cooperate with the designated responsible party with regard to any actions
required to comply with ISRA, including providing access to its facilities
and record necessary for completion of site investigations, execution of
required certifications, and completion and submission to NJDEP of such
notices and applications as are reasonably necessary for the expeditious
completion of the parties ISRA compliance obligations. It is understood that
each party shall be responsible for its own ISRA compliance costs and expenses
and that liability for site investigation or remediation, if any is required,
shall remain the responsibility of the entity that is the owner, lessee or
operator of the ISRA-subject property.

 

Section 6.16 _Certain Pre-Closing Actions_.

 

 __(a) _Amneal Pre-Closing Actions_. Prior to the Closing, Amneal shall take
all actions set forth on _Section 6.16_ of the Amneal Disclosure Letter
(such actions, the " _Amneal Pre-Closing Actions_ "); _provided_ , that
_Section 6.16_ of the Amneal Disclosure Letter may be amended or modified by
Amneal with the prior written consent of Impax (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Immediately following the
Recapitalization, Amneal shall cause each Existing Amneal Member to contribute
its Amneal Units to Amneal Holdings, LLC in exchange for additional interests
in Amneal Holdings, LLC (and shall cause the schedule of members to the
Restated Amneal LLC Operating Agreement to be updated accordingly). __

 

 __(b) _Impax Pre-Closing Actions_. Prior to the Closing, Impax shall take all
actions set forth on _Section 6.16_ of the Impax Disclosure Letter (such
actions, the " _Impax Pre-Closing Actions_ "); _provided_ , that _Section
6.16_ of the Impax Disclosure Letter may be amended or modified by Impax with
the prior written consent of Amneal (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). __

 



86 Section 6.17 _Impax Director and Officer Resignations_. At the Closing, Impax
shall deliver to Amneal evidence reasonably satisfactory to Amneal of the
resignation, effective at the Contribution Effective Time, of each director
and officer of Impax in office as of immediately prior to the Impax Merger
Effective Time.

 

Section 6.18 _Certain Tax Matters_. None of Impax nor Amneal nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall knowingly take any action or fail to take any
reasonable action if such action or failure to act would be reasonably likely
to prevent or impede (i) the Impax Merger and the LLC Conversion, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) the Contribution from qualifying as an exchange to
which Section 721(a) of the Code applies. The parties will report the
transactions described in the preceding sentence in the manner set forth
therein except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 

Section 6.19 _Treatment of Impax Convertible Notes; Convertible Note Hedge
Transactions_.

 

(a) Upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice from Amneal
made not later than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Impax shall use its reasonable best efforts to if requested by Amneal,
commence a stand-alone consent solicitation with respect to one or more
covenants in the Impax Indenture, the primary purpose of which would be
to facilitate the Transactions and the Ancillary Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and which would include a covenant by Impax to tender for any
and all outstanding Impax Convertible Notes promptly following the Closing
Date (the " _Impax Liability Management Transaction_ "). The Impax Liability
Management Transaction will contain such customary terms and conditions as are
reasonably requested by Amneal ( _provided_ , that the consideration to be
paid in connection therewith shall be determined by Amneal in its reasonable
discretion) and an expiration date not later than one Business Day prior to
the consummation of the offer to purchase the Impax Convertible Notes;
_provided_ , that (i) this Agreement shall have not been terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_ and (ii) Impax shall have received from Amneal
within such period all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection
with the Impax Liability Management Transaction, including the consent
solicitation statement and consent forms and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Liability Management Documents_ "), which shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Impax. Impax shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make any change to the terms and
conditions of the Impax Liability Management Transaction reasonably requested
by Amneal; _provided_ that no extension of the expiration date shall occur
without the prior written consent of Impax (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed to the extent that such extension would not
reasonably be expected to cause a delay in or prevent the
Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the effectiveness of any proposed
amendments to the Impax Indenture contemplated by the Impax Liability
Management Transactions hall be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing
and any proposed amendments to the Impax Indenture contemplated by the Impax
Liability Management Transaction shall revert to the form in effect prior to
the effectiveness of any proposed amendments and be of no further effect if
this Agreement is 

 



87  terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. Amneal shall only request Impax and
its Subsidiaries to conduct the Impax Liability Management Transaction in
compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and the indenture relating to the Impax
Convertible Notes. Amneal shall ensure that the Surviving Company shall have
all funds necessary to pay any consideration required to be paid in
connection with the Impax Liability Management Transaction.

(b) In the event that Impax commences the Impax Liability Management
Transaction, Impax agrees that, promptly following any consent expiration
date, assuming the requisite consents are received and the conditions set
forth in the Impax Indenture have been satisfied, Impax shall execute a
supplemental indenture to the Impax Indenture, which supplemental indenture
shall implement the amendments set forth in the Liability Management Documents
and shall become operative upon the Closing. Amneal shall provide, or cause to
be provided, the requisite amount of funds to Impax for all payments to
holders of Impax Convertible Notes in respect of any consents validly
delivered and not revoked in accordance with the Impax Liability Management
Transaction and, all other fees and expenses relating to the Impax Liability
Management Transaction.

(c) Any Liability Management Documents (including all amendments or
supplements thereto) and all mailings to the holders of the Impax Convertible
Notes in connection with any Impax Liability Management Transaction shall be
subject to the prior review of, and comment (which review and comment shall be
made as promptly as reasonably practical) by, Impax and Amneal and shall be
reasonably acceptable in form and substance to each of them. If, at any time
prior to the completion of the Impax Liability Management Transaction, any
information in the Liability Management Documents should be discovered by
Impax, on the one hand, or Amneal, on the other, which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement thereto, so that they shall not contain any untrue
statements of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party in
writing, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of Impax to the holders of
the Impax Convertible Notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 6.19_, Impax shall comply in all material respects with all Laws in
connection with the Impax Liability Management Transaction. To the extent that
the provisions of the Impax Indenture, the Impax Convertible Notes or of any
Law conflict with this  _Section 6.19_, Impax shall comply with the Impax
Indenture, the Impax Convertible Notes and applicable Law and in all material
respects shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by
such compliance.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (A) neither Impax nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any fees in connection with the
Impax Liability Management Transaction prior to the Closing; (2) have any
liability or obligation under any agreement or any document related to the
Impax Liability Management Transaction until the Closing occurs; (3) be
required to incur any liability that is not expressly provided for herein in
connection with the Impax Liability Management Transaction and not otherwise
indemnified hereunder; (4) otherwise be required to take any action in
violation or conflict with any of Impax or its Subsidiaries respective
organizational documents or applicable Law; (5) be required to deliver
opinions of external or internal counsel; (6) be required to provide access to
or disclose information that 

 



88  would reasonably be expected to jeopardize attorney-client privilege or
contravene Law or violate any Contract; (7) be required to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or any other Contract to which Impax or its
Subsidiaries is a party; (8) be required to provide any cooperation to the
extent it would (x) cause any condition to Closing set forth in _Article VII_
not to be satisfied or cause (y) a breach of this Agreement; (9) no material
obligation of Impax or its Subsidiaries under any document, agreement or any
other contract relating to the Impax Liability Management Transaction shall be
operative prior to the Closing; and (B) notwithstanding the above, all
corporate, limited liability or other organizational actions shall be deemed
to become effective only if and when the Closing occurs, and shall only be
taken by, the board of directors of Impax and its Subsidiaries or other
governing body of Impax and its Subsidiaries as constituted after giving
effect to the Closing.

(e) Amneal shall indemnify and hold harmless Impax and its Subsidiaries, and
their respective officers, employees and Representatives, from and against any
and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the Impax Liability Management Transaction and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except in the event such liabilities or losses arose out
of or result from (i) the willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith of
Impax and its Subsidiaries or (ii) historical information furnished in
writing by or on behalf of Impax and its Subsidiaries expressly for inclusion
in any marketing materials. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Article VIII_, Amneal shall, promptly upon request by Impax, reimburse
Impax and its Subsidiaries for all reasonable and documents out-of-pocket
costs incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries (including those of its
Affiliates and Representatives) in connection with taking action required or
requested by Amneal pursuant to this _Section 6.19_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is expressly agreed
by the parties hereto that the failure to obtain the consent of the holders of
the Impax Convertible Notes in connection with any Impax Liability Management
Transaction or the inability to redeem any of the Impax Convertible Notes on
the Closing Date shall not be deemed to be a breach by Impax under this
Agreement or otherwise delay the Closing; _provided_ , that the foregoing is
not intended to limit any rights or remedies that Amneal may have under this
Agreement in the event of any applicable breach by Impax of any of its
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.19_. Furthermore, Impax shall have
been deemed to perform all of its obligations under this _Section 6.19_
unless it materially breaches this _Section 6.19_ and such breach is a
substantial cause of the Impax Liability Management Transaction not being
consummated.

 

(g) Impax, Amneal and Holdco shall take all necessary action to execute and
deliver to the Trustee (as defined in Impax Indenture) a supplemental
indenture to the Impax Indenture, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee and Amneal, pursuant to the terms of the Impax Indenture, to provide
that on and after the Closing, each holder of the Impax Convertible Notes
shall have the right to convert such Impax Convertible Notes into the
conversion consideration determined by reference to the consideration
receivable upon consummation of the Impax Merger in respect of each share of
Impax Common Stock in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of the
Impax Indenture (including any applicable increase in the "Conversion Rate" or
decrease in the "Conversion Price" (each as defined in the Impax Indenture)
thereunder in connection with the Impax Merger) in each case in accordance
with, and subject to the Impax Indenture (including without limitation the
time periods specified therein), as a result of the

 



89  execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Transactions. Impax shall
provide Amneal and its Representatives reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any material written notice or material communication to or with
holders of the Impax Convertible Notes or with the Trustee under the Impax
Indenture at least two (2) Business Days prior to the dispatch or making
thereof, and Impax shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Amneal or its Representatives.

(h) Impax will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Amneal
to obtain the consent of Royal Bank of Canada (the " _Call Spread Dealer_ ")
to terminate the Convertible Note Hedge Transaction at or as promptly as
practicable following the Closing. Impax will use commercially
reasonable efforts to involve Amneal in connection with any discussions,
negotiations or communications, and Impax will involve Amneal in connection
with any agreements, with the Call Spread Dealer or any of its Affiliates
(including each other counterparty to the Convertible Note Hedge
Transactions) with respect to any determination, adjustment, cancellation,
termination, exercise, settlement or computation in connection with the
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, including with respect to any
cash amounts and/or shares of Impax Common Stock that may be receivable,
issuable, deliverable or payable by Impax pursuant to the Convertible Note
Hedge Transactions or any adjustments of the terms thereof, and Impax will
give prior notice to Amneal of any such discussions, negotiations,
communications or agreements; provided that if such prior notice is not
reasonably practicable, Impax shall give Amneal notice of any such
discussions, negotiations, communications or agreements promptly after such
discussions, negotiations, communications or agreements, with a description in
reasonable detail thereof. Impax (i) prior to the Closing, will not, and will
cause its Representatives not to, without Amneals prior written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned
(x) make any amendments, modifications or other changes to the terms of, or
agree to any adjustment under or amounts due upon termination, cancellation or
early settlement of, the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, or (y) exercise
any right it may have to terminate, or cause the early settlement or
cancellation of, any of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and (ii) will
keep Amneal fully informed of all discussions and negotiations relating to
the foregoing. Impax will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely take
all such other actions as may be required in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, including delivery of
any notices or other documents or instruments required to give effect to the
foregoing or in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, each of
which will be so delivered substantially in the form previously provided to
Amneal for Amneals review other than to address comments provided by Amneal
or its Representatives. In addition, Impax will promptly (and, in any event,
within one Business Day) provide to Amneal a copy of any written notice
received from the Call Spread Dealer in connection with the Convertible Note
Hedge Transactions (including any written notice with respect to any
determination, adjustment, cancellation, termination, exercise, settlement or
computation in connection with the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions). For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein this Agreement shall prohibit
Impax from settling upon conversion of the Impax Convertible Notes in
accordance with the terms of the Impax Indenture and complying with the terms
of the Convertible Note Hedge Transactions in connection therewith and nothing
herein shall require Impax to effect a termination or settlement of the
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions prior to the Closing.

Agreement and prior to the date of such termination (in the case of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(i)_) or the Impax Stockholder
Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_) a
Competing Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise made publicly

(2) Business Days of such consummation, Impax shall pay to Amneal the

specified in writing by Amneal;

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Impax pursuant to _Section

day funds within two (2) Business Days following the date on which Amneal
submits to Impax true and correct copies of reasonable documentation

95 (c) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.02_ are an integral part of the Transactions,
(ii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement, (iii) the payments required pursuant to this _Section 8.02_ are
not penalties, but rather are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Amneal in the circumstances in which such payments are payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iv) the amount of the
Termination Fee, if and as applicable, is fair, after taking into account the
value of the Transactions and all the costs and expenses already incurred by
the parties before entering into this Agreement. In no event shall Impax be
required to pay Amneal more than one Termination Fee, if and as applicable,
pursuant to this _Section 8.02_.

(d) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) upon any
valid termination of this Agreement where the Termination Fee becomes due and
payable, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_
shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages
of Amneal and its Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers and
other Representatives, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions, including as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Transactions,
and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of such breach,
termination or failure; and (ii) in no event shall Amneal or its Affiliates,
or any of their respective directors, officers or other Representatives, be
entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the
Termination Fee (plus, in the case the Termination Fee is not timely paid, the
amounts described in _Section 8.02(e)_) against Impax, its Subsidiaries and
any of its or their respective directors, officers and other Representatives;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
8.02(d)_, payment by Impax of the Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section
8.02(a)_ shall not relieve Impax from any liability or damage resulting from
fraud or any willful and material breach of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Termination Fee shall be credited towards any future
award of damages awarded to Amneal pursuant to any claim based on fraud or any
willful and material breach of this Agreement.

(e) If Impax fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section
8.02_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Amneal commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Impax for any such amount, Impax shall pay to
Amneal its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount from the date such amount was required to be paid
until the date of payment at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such amount was required to be paid.

Section 8.03  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Impax or Amneal as provided in _Section 8.01_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Amneal or Impax, other than the
provisions of the penultimate sentence of _Section 6.03_, _Section 6.06_,
_Section 6.11(b)(ii)_, _Section 6.19(e)_, _Section 6.19(f)_,  _Section
8.02_, this _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_, which provisions shall survive
such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall relieve
any party from any liability for fraud or any willful and material breach of
this Agreement.

 



96 Section 8.04 _Procedure for Termination_. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 8.01_ shall, in order to be effective, require, in the
case of Amneal or Impax, action by the Amneal Board or the Impax Board, as
applicable.

Section 9.09 _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that they
would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement without proof of actual damages, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties hereto hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in
the event, that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such
action or proceeding, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex

proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware)
(such courts, the " _Chosen Courts_ ")). In addition, each of the parties
irrevocably (a) submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts for the purpose of any litigation directly or indirectly based upon,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from the Chosen Courts and (c) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any litigation with respect to this Agreement,
(x) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the
Chosen Courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance
with this _Section 9.09_, (y) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in Chosen Courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the

 



113  suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced
in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.02_
and agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
personal delivery to the respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.02_
shall be effective service of process for any litigation in connection with
this Agreement or the Transactions. Nothing in this  _Section 9.09_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in the preceding clause (a) to the contrary, and
without limiting anything set forth in _Section 9.17_, each of the parties
hereto (on behalf of itself and its controlled Affiliates) agrees that it will
not bring or support any suit, action or other proceeding (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source
or Debt Financing Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transactions and
any related financing), including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than any New York State court or federal court sitting in the county of New
York and the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof), except to
the extent such courts do not have jurisdiction over any Debt Financing Source
or Debt Financing Party. The parties hereto further agree that all of the
provisions of _Section 9.10_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any suit, action or other proceeding referenced in this _Section 9.09_.

 

Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL ACTION AGAINST ANY DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES OR DEBT FINANCING PARTIES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE DEBT FINANCING). EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED AND
UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section
9.10_.

 

Section 9.11 _Severability_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
if any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



114 Section 9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Impax Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Impax Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further stockholder approval
without such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, _Sections 9.06_, _9.07_ ,
_9.09(b)_ ,  _9.10_ , _9.17_ and this _Section 9.12_ (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing provisions) may
not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse
in any respect to a Debt Financing Source or Debt Financing Party without the
prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source or Debt Financing Party.

 

Section 9.13 _Further Assurances_. The parties agree to execute and deliver to
each other such other documents and to do such other acts and things, all as
the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of this Agreement and the documents referred to in this Agreement.

 

Section 9.14 _Extension; Waiver_.

 

(a) At any time prior to the Closing, each party hereto may (i) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein by any other party or in
any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other
applicable party or (iii) subject to the provision to the first sentence of
_Section 9.12_ and to the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

(b) The failure of any party to this Agreement to exercise any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver by such party
of such right.

Section 9.15 _Disclosure Letters_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Impax Disclosure Letter or the Amneal Disclosure Letter, as applicable
(together, the " _Disclosure Letters_ ") shall have the meanings ascribed to
them in this Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Impax and Amneal, as applicable, set forth in this Agreement
are made and given subject to, and are qualified by, the Impax Disclosure
Letter or Amneal Disclosure Letter, as applicable. Unless the context shall
otherwise require, any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of
the Disclosure Letters shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the section or
subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other
section or subsection of _Article III_ or  _Article IV_, as applicable, of
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that
such information is relevant to such other section or subsection of _Article
III_ or _Article IV_, as applicable. The Disclosure Letters may include
brief descriptions or summaries of certain agreements and instruments. The
descriptions or summaries do not purport to be comprehensive and are qualified
in their entirety

 



115  by reference to the text of the documents described. No disclosure set forth
in the Disclosure Letters relating to any possible breach or violation of any
Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. The inclusion of any
information in the Disclosure Letters shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment that such information (a) is required by the terms of this
Agreement to be disclosed, (b) is material to Impax or Amneal, as applicable,
their respective Subsidiaries or any other party, (c) has resulted in or would
result in an Impax Material Adverse Effect or Amneal Material Adverse Effect,
as applicable, or (d) is outside the ordinary course of business. Matters
reflected in the Disclosure Letters are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Letters. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

 

Section 9.16 _Limitation on Claims_. Except with respect to claims of, or
causes of action arising from, fraud, any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against
persons that are expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein. Except with respect to

in respect of, or by reason of, the Transactions (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such Transactions), in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law or otherwise and whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a party hereto or another person or otherwise.

Section 9.17 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or
causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,

to be made in connection herewith. In no event shall Impax or any of its

Section 2.  _Ranking_. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the

holders of any series of Preferred Stock as may be designated by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation upon any issuance of any series of Preferred
Stock.

other rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the
Board of Directors of the Corporation at any time and from time to time may

out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. When, as and if
such dividends are declared by the Corporations Board of Directors of the
Corporation, whether payable in cash, property, or securities of the

equally therein, in accordance with the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock held by each such holder. Dividends shall not be declared or paid on the

all remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution among the
stockholders of the Corporation, whether such assets are capital, surplus or

entitled to receive any assets of the Corporation in the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the affairs of the Corporation.

 

For the purposes of this Section 4, neither the consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations, nor the sale,
lease, exchange or transfer by the Corporation of all or any part of its
assets, nor the reduction of the capital stock of the Corporation, shall be
deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-
up of the Corporation.

Section 5\. _Restrictions on Transfer and Issuances_.

 



     | a) | No shares of Class B Common Stock may be issued except to a
holder of Common Units or its Affiliates (other than the Corporation or any

its Affiliates) holds an identical number of Common Units and shares of Class
B Common Stock unless otherwise provided in the LLC Agreement (as defined
below).

which transfer of such shares shall, to the full extent permitted by
law, automatically be retired or (ii) in accordance with the terms of the
Stockholders Agreement (as defined herein) and the Third Amended and Restated

of the Corporation upon written request therefor. Any stock certificates

the transfer restrictions set forth herein. As used in this Certificate of
Incorporation, " _Common Units_ " has the meaning assigned to such term in
the LLC Agreement.

forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does
not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, or, if
such other court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding

breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporations stockholders, (c) any

Certificate of Incorporation (as may be amended, altered, changed or repealed)
or the Bylaws or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal
affairs doctrine. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of
capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and
consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE TENTH.

 

ELEVENTH: CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

 

Section 1\. _General_. In recognition and anticipation (a) that the
Corporation will not be a wholly owned subsidiary of Amneal and that Amneal
will be a significant stockholder of the Corporation, (b) that directors,
officers and/or employees of Amneal may serve as directors and/or officers of
the Corporation, (c) that, subject to any contractual arrangements that may
otherwise from time to time be agreed to between Amneal and the Corporation
(including the Stockholders Agreement), Amneal engages or may engage in the
same, similar or related lines of business as those in which the Corporation,
directly or indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that
overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage, (d) that Amneal may have an interest in the same areas
of corporate opportunity as the Corporation and Affiliated Companies thereof,
and (e) that, as a consequence  of the foregoing, it is in the best interests of the Corporation that the
respective rights and duties of the Corporation and of Amneal, and the duties
of any directors and/or officers of the Corporation who are also directors,
officers and/or employees of Amneal, be determined and delineated in respect
of any transactions between, or opportunities that may be suitable for both,
the Corporation and Affiliated Companies thereof, on the one hand, and
Amneal, on the other hand. The sections of this ARTICLE ELEVENTH shall to the
fullest extent permitted by law regulate and define the conduct of certain of
the business and affairs of the Corporation in relation to Amneal and
the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation as they may involve Amneal
and its directors, officers and/or employees, and the power, rights, duties
and liabilities of the Corporation and its officers, directors and
stockholders in connection therewith. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any shares of capital
stock of the Corporation, or any interest therein, shall be deemed to have
notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE ELEVENTH.

Section 2\. _Certain Agreements and Transactions Permitted_. The Corporation
has entered into the Stockholders Agreement with Amneal, and, subject to the
Stockholders Agreement, may from time to time enter into and perform, and
cause or permit any Affiliated Company of the Corporation to enter into and
perform, one or more agreements (or modifications or supplements to pre-
existing agreements) with Amneal pursuant to which the Corporation or an
Affiliated Company thereof, on the one hand, and Amneal, on the other hand,
agree to engage in transactions of any kind or nature with each other and/or
agree to compete, or to refrain from competing or to limit or restrict their
competition, with each other, including to allocate and to cause their
respective directors, officers and/or employees (including any who are
directors, officers and/or employees of both) to allocate opportunities
between or to refer opportunities to each other.

 

Section 3\. _Corporate Opportunities_. Except as otherwise agreed in writing
between the Corporation and Amneal, including in the Stockholders Agreement,
Amneal shall to the fullest extent permitted by law have no duty to refrain
from (a) engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as
the Corporation or (b) doing business with any client, customer or vendor of
the Corporation. Except as otherwise agreed in writing between the Corporation
and Amneal, the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law renounces
any interest or expectancy of the Corporation or any of its Affiliated
Companies in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any
corporate opportunity presented to Amneal or any Dual Role Person pursuant to
Section 122(17) of the DGCL and waives any claim that such business
opportunity constituted a corporate opportunity that should have been
presented to the Corporation or any Affiliated Company thereof, if, in the
case of a corporate opportunity presented to Amneal, Amneal acts in a manner
consistent with the following policy: if Amneal is presented with or acquires
knowledge of a corporate opportunity, such corporate opportunity shall belong
to Amneal unless such opportunity was expressly offered to Amneal in its
capacity as a stockholder of the Corporation. In the case of any
corporate opportunity in which the Corporation has renounced its interest and
expectancy in the previous sentence, Amneal shall to the fullest extent
permitted by law not be liable to the Corporation by reason of the fact that
Amneal acquires or seeks such corporate opportunity for itself, directs such
corporate opportunity to another person, or otherwise does not communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation. Section 4\. _Dual Role Persons_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no
Dual Role Person who is presented with or acquires knowledge of a corporate
opportunity in any capacity (i) shall have any duty to communicate or offer to
the Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies any corporate opportunity,
(ii) shall be prohibited from communicating or offering any corporate
opportunity to Amneal or any other person or participating in such corporate
opportunity and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall have any
liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary
duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation, as the case may
be, related to such corporate opportunity.

 

Section 5\. _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this ARTICLE ELEVENTH, (a)
" _Affiliated Company_ " in respect of the Corporation shall mean any entity
controlled by the Corporation, (b) " _corporate opportunities_ " shall
include, but not be limited to, business opportunities that the Corporation is
financially able to undertake, which are, from their nature, in the line of
the Corporations business, are of practical advantage to it and are
opportunities in which the Corporation, but for Section 3 of this ARTICLE
ELEVENTH would have an interest or a reasonable expectancy, and in which, by
embracing the opportunities, the self-interest of Amneal or its directors,
officers and/or employees will be brought into conflict with that of the
Corporation, (c) " _Amneal_ " shall mean Amneal Holdings LLC and its
Affiliates (other than the Corporation and any entity that is controlled by
the Corporation), and (d) " _Dual Role Person_ " shall mean any individual who
is a director, officer or employee of the Corporation and is also a director,
officer or employee of Amneal.

TWELFTH: STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT

 

For so long as that certain Stockholders Agreement, dated as of October 17,
2017, by and among the Corporation and each of the Amneal Group Members (as
defined therein), as amended from time to time, a copy of which will be
provided to any stockholder of the Corporation upon written request therefor
(the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "), is in effect, the provisions of
the Stockholders Agreement shall be incorporated by reference into the
relevant provisions hereof, and such provisions shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner consistent with the terms of the Stockholders Agreement.

 

THIRTEENTH: INDEMNIFICATION, ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES AND EXCULPATION

 

Section 1\. _Right to Indemnification_. The Corporation shall indemnify and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it
presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or
is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he, or a person for whom he is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect
to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and
expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such person;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any
director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person or any proceeding by such person against the
Corporation or its directors, officers, employees or other agents unless (i)
such indemnification is expressly required to be made by applicable law, (ii)
the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
(iii) such indemnification is provided by the Corporation, in its sole
discretion, or (iv) such indemnification is required to be made under Section
3 of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH, pursuant to the powers vested in the
Corporation under the DGCL or any other applicable law. Section 2\. _Advancement of Expenses_.

 



     | a) | The Corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
officer, of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of
the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by
any director or officer in defending any such proceeding, provided, however,
that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director
or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter, an
"undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication")
that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this Section 2 of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH or otherwise.  
---|---|--- 



     | b) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined
pursuant to Section 2 of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH, no advance shall be made by
the Corporation to an executive officer of the Corporation (except by
reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the
Corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a
determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of
directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or
(ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority vote of such
directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such
directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a
written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time
such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such
person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3\. _Enforcement_. Without the necessity of entering into an express
contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
officers under this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall be deemed to be contractual
rights and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a
contract between the Corporation and the director or officer. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH to a director
or officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such
right in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for
indemnification or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no
disposition of such claim is made within sixty (60) days of request therefor.
The claimant in such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part,
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In
connection with any claim for indemnification, the Corporation shall be
entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or
any other applicable law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for
the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of
the Corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such
executive officer is or was a director of the Corporation) for advances, the
Corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear
and convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner
that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that
such person acted without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an
actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of
proving that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH or
otherwise shall be on the Corporation. Section 4\. _Good Faith_.

 



     | a) | For purposes of any determination under this ARTICLE
THIRTEENTH, a director or executive officer shall be deemed to have acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe that his
conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on information, opinions, reports
and statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in
each case prepared or presented by: 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | one or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the
director or executive officer believed to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | ii. | counsel, independent accountants or other persons as to
matters which the director or executive officer believed to be within such
persons professional competence; and 
---|---|--- Directors of the Corporation upon which such director does not serve, as to
matters within such Committees designated authority, which committee the
director believes to merit confidence; so long as, in each case, the director
or executive officer acts without knowledge that would cause such reliance to
be unwarranted. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b) | The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, that he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | c) | The provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall not be deemed
to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may
be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth by
the DGCL. 
---|---|--- 

Section 5\. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person
by this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall not be exclusive of any other rights which
such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The
Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with
any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting
indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the
DGCL, or by any other applicable law.

 

Section 6\. _Other Indemnification_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any amount such
person may collect as indemnification from such other
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
enterprise.

Section 7\. _Insurance_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may
authorize the Corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, member, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such
capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under
the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH or of the DGCL; and the Corporation
may create a trust fund, grant a security interest and/or use other means
(including, without limitation, letters of credit, surety bonds and/or other
similar arrangements) to the full extent authorized or permitted by the DGCL
and other applicable law to ensure the payment of such amounts as may
become necessary to effect the indemnification as provided in this ARTICLE
THIRTEENTH or elsewhere. Section 8\. _Definitions_. For the purposes of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH, the
following definition shall apply:



     | a) | The term "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent
of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if
its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to
indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, member, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH
with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b) | The term "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit
plans; 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | The term "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a
person with respect to any employee benefit plan; 
---|---|--- 



     | d) | References to "serving at the request of the Corporation"
shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such
director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and 
---|---|--- 



     | e) | A person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a
manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to
in this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH. 
---|---|--- 

Section 9\. _Liability of Directors_. No director of the Corporation shall be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director; provided, however, that this,
limitation of liability shall not eliminate or limit the liabilities of the
directors for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation
or its stockholders, for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, under Section 174 of
the DGCL, or for any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit; provided, further, that this limitation of liability shall
not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any act or omission
occurring prior to the filing of this Certificate of Incorporation.

Section 10\. _Survival of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this
ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

Section 11\. _Savings Clause_. If this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH or any portion
hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director
and officer to the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of
this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH that shall not have been invalidated, or by any other
applicable law. If this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall be invalid due to the
application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then
the Corporation shall indemnify each director and officer to the full extent
under any other applicable law. Section 12\. _Amendment or Repeal_. Any repeal or modification of the
provisions of this ARTICLE THIRTEENTH shall only be prospective and shall not
adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of
any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or
modification.

MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

SECTION 2\. ANNUAL MEETINGS. Annual meetings of stockholders for the election
of directors and for such other business as may properly come before such
meeting in accordance with all applicable requirements of these Bylaws and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time
(the " _DGCL_ "), shall be held at such place, either within or without the
State of Delaware, and at such time and date as shall from time to time be
determined by the Board. Any previously scheduled annual meeting of the
stockholders may be postponed by action of the Board taken prior to the time
previously scheduled for such annual meeting of stockholders. The Board may,
in its sole discretion, determine that the meeting shall not be held at any
place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication
as provided under the DGCL.

SECTION 3\. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of stockholders, unless
otherwise prescribed by the DGCL or the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of the Corporation (as amended from time to time, the " _Certificate_ "), may
be called by a Co-Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or
by resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized
directors (whether or not there exists any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for
adoption). Only such business as is specified in the Corporations notice of
any such special meeting of stockholders shall come before, and be conducted
at, such meeting. A special meeting shall be held at such place, on such date
and at such time as shall be fixed by the Board. Any previously scheduled
special meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by action of the Board
taken prior to the time previously scheduled for such special meeting of
stockholders.

 

SECTION 4\. NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall, unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate or these Bylaws, be
given not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the
date of any such meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at   such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date and hour and,
in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and
the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at any such meeting. If
mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage
prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address as it
appears on the records of the corporation. Such notice may be waived in
writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof or by electronic
transmission by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be
waived by any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends
a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting
shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if
due notice thereof had been given.

 

SECTION 5\. QUORUM. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by statute, by the Certificate, or by these Bylaws, the presence, in
person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly
authorized, of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of stock entitled to vote thereat shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. Where a separate vote by a class, classes or
series is required, except where otherwise provided by statute, the
Certificate or these Bylaws, a majority in voting power of the outstanding
shares of such class, classes or series, present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall
constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that
matter. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be
adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of the meeting or by vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no other
business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a
duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum.

 

SECTION 6\. VOTING. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate, each
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock
held by such stockholder. The Board, in its discretion, or the chairperson of
the meeting of stockholders, in his or her discretion, may require that any
votes cast at a meeting of stockholders shall be cast by written ballot. In
all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the
majority in voting power of shares of stock present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders
unless a different or minimum vote is required by the Certificate, these
Bylaws or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the
Corporation or its securities, in which case such different or minimum vote
shall be the applicable vote on the matter. Each director shall be elected by
the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such
directors election (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must
exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee) at any meeting for
the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided that each
director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast (instead of by
votes cast for or against a nominee) at any meeting at which a quorum in
present for which the Board determines that the number of nominees exceeds the
number of directors to be elected at such election and such determination
has not been rescinded by the Board on or prior to the tenth

 



\- 2 -  day preceding the date the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for
such meeting to the stockholders (a " _Contested Election_ "). In an election
other than a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to
cast votes "for" or "against" the election of directors or to "abstain" from
such vote (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast
"for" or "against" the election of such candidate), and stockholders shall not
have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of
directors. In a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to
cast "for" or "withhold" votes for the election of directors (with abstentions
and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast) and shall not have the
ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors.

SECTION 7\. INSPECTORS. The Board may, in advance of any meeting
of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting or any
adjournment thereof. If any of the inspectors so appointed shall fail to
appear or act, the chairman of the meeting may, or if inspectors shall not
have been appointed, the chairman of the meeting shall, appoint one or more
inspectors. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at
such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his
ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each, (b)
ascertain the number of shares represented at the meeting, (c) ascertain the
existence of a quorum, (d) ascertain the validity and effect of proxies, (e)
count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, (f) determine and retain
for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of all challenges made to
any determination made by the inspectors, (g) certify the determination of the
number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and
ballots, and (h) do such other acts as are proper to conduct the election or
vote in accordance with applicable law. On request of the chairman of the
meeting, the inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge,
request or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any
fact found by them. No director or candidate for the office of director shall
act as an inspector of an election of directors. The inspectors may appoint or
retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance
of the duties of the inspectors. In determining the validity and counting of
all proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall act in accordance with
applicable law.

 

SECTION 8\. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS. A Co-Chairman of the Board shall preside at
all stockholders meetings. In the absence of a Co-Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer shall preside or, in his or her absence, any officer
designated by the Board shall preside. The Secretary, or, in the Secretarys
absence, an Assistant Secretary, or in the absence of both the Secretary and
Assistant Secretaries, a person appointed by the chairman of the meeting shall
serve as secretary of the meeting. In the event that the Secretary presides
at a meeting of the stockholders, an Assistant Secretary shall record the
minutes of the meeting. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Board
shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for the conduct of
meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary, appropriate or
convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the Board, if any, the
chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and (for
any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting and to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion
of such chairman, are deemed necessary, appropriate or convenient for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations and procedures,
whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may
include, without limitation, the following: (a) establishing an agenda for the
meeting and the order for the consideration of the 

 



\- 3 -  items of business on such agenda; (b) restricting admission to the time set

their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the
meeting may determine; (d) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter
to stockholders of record of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter,
their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairman of the
meeting may determine to recognize and, as a condition to recognizing any such
participant, requiring such participant to provide the chairman of the
meeting with evidence of his or her name and affiliation, whether he or she is
a stockholder or a proxy for a stockholder, and the class and series and

stockholder; (e) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants; (f) determining when the polls should be opened and closed for

otherwise determined by the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders
shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules
of parliamentary procedure.

SECTION 9\. LISTS OF STOCKHOLDERS. The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten
(10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order,
showing the address of each stockholder and the number and class of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section
9 shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other
electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during
ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a physical location, then the
list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during
the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is
present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communications, then the list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall
be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the
stock ledger, the list required by this Section 9 or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

SECTION 10. ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. Unless otherwise provided by the
Certificate, any action required by applicable law to be taken at any annual
or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken at such
meetings, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote were present and voted. Prompt
notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

are present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented
by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place of the adjourned
meeting, whether or not a quorum is present. At any such adjourned meeting at

satisfactory in the discretion of the Board, any committee thereof or any
authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the accuracy of any

at any meeting of stockholders unless nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 17\.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, if a

qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or

stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder
or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such
stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must

Certificate or these Bylaws, a Co-Chairman of the Board or other person
presiding at the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to determine
whether any nomination proposed to be brought before the meeting was
properly made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 17,
including whether the stockholder or any Stockholder Associated Person on
whose behalf the nomination is made, solicited (or is part of a group which
solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of
the election of such stockholders nominee(s) in compliance with such
stockholders representation as required by this Section 17, and (B) if any
proposed nomination was not made in compliance with this Section 17, to
declare that such nomination is defective and shall be disregarded.

(5) In addition to the provisions of this Section 17, a stockholder shall
also comply with all applicable requirements of the DGCL, other applicable law
and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect
to the matters set forth herein,  _provided_ , _however_ , that any
references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated
thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the applicable requirements
for nominations by stockholders to be considered pursuant to Section 17(a) or
Section 17(b) of these Bylaws.

under applicable law, the Certificate or these Bylaws.

purposes of this Section 19, "cause" shall mean (a) a final conviction of a
felony involving moral turpitude, or (b) willful misconduct that is
materially and demonstrably injurious economically to the Corporation. For
purposes of this definition of "cause," no act, or failure to act, by a
director shall be considered "willful" unless committed in bad faith and
without a reasonable belief that the act or failure to act was in the best
interest of the Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation. "Cause" shall
not exist unless and until the Corporation has delivered to the director
a written notice of the directors failure to act that constitutes "cause"
and, if cure is possible, such director shall not have cured such act or
omission within ninety (90) days after the delivery of such notice.

directors or any committee thereof, but not less than one (1), shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Subject to the provisions

of the Board, unless a different vote is required by applicable law, the

SECTION 44\. STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD. The Corporation shall be entitled to
treat the holder of record of any share or shares of its capital stock as the
holder thereof, in fact, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
other claim to or interest in such shares on the part of any other person,
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as
otherwise expressly provided by the DGCL or other applicable law.

SECTION 45\. RECORD DATE.

 

(a) _Record Date for Meetings of Stockholders_. For the purpose of determining
the stockholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the directors may fix, in advance, a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days
before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A
determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
any meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

 

(b) _Record Date for Payments of Dividends and Distributions_. In order that
the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of
any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the
stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion, or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and
which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action.
If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for
any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



\- 20 - (c) _Record Date for Corporate Actions by Written Consent_.

 

(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be as fixed by the
Board or as otherwise established under this Section 46(c). Any person seeking
to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent
without a meeting shall, by written notice addressed to the Secretary
and delivered to the Corporation, request that a record date be fixed for
such purpose. The Board may fix a record date for such purpose which shall be
no more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board and shall not precede the date on which
such resolution is adopted. If the Board fails within ten (10) days after the
Corporation receives such notice to fix a record date for such purpose, the
record date shall be the day on which the first written consent is delivered
to the Corporation in the manner described in Section 46(c)(ii) below unless
prior action by the Board is required under the DGCL, in which event the
record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

(ii) (A) Each written consent purporting to take or authorizing the taking of
corporate action is referred to in this Section 46(c)(ii) of these Bylaws as a
" _Consent_ ". No Consent shall be effective to take the corporate action
referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the first date on which
a consent is so delivered to the Corporation in the manner required by this
Section 46(c)(ii), Consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to
take such action, and not revoked, are so delivered to the Corporation.

(B) A Consent shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery to the
Corporations registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested.

(C) In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a Consent,
the Secretary shall provide for the safe-keeping of such Consent and shall
promptly conduct such ministerial review of the sufficiency of the Consents
and of the validity of the action to be taken by stockholder consent as he
deems necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the
holders of a number of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize
or take the action specified in the Consent have given consent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the corporate action to which the Consent relates is the
removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board, the Secretary
shall promptly designate two persons, who shall not be members of the Board,
to serve as inspectors with respect to such Consent and such inspectors shall
discharge the functions of the Secretary under this Section 45(c)(ii). If
after such investigation the Secretary or the inspectors (as the case may be)
shall determine that the Consent is valid and that the action therein
specified has been validly authorized, that fact shall forthwith be certified
on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the
proceedings of meetings of stockholders, and the Consent shall be filed in
such records, at which time the Consent shall become effective as stockholder
action. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 45(c)(ii),
the Secretary or the inspectors (as the case may be) may, at the expense of
the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or
appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem
necessary or appropriate to assist them, and to the fullest extent permitted
by law shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of
such counsel or advisors.

 



\- 21 - SECTION 46\. DIVIDENDS. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate, the
Board may at any regular or special meeting, out of funds legally available
therefor, declare and pay dividends upon the stock of the Corporation. Before
the declaration of any dividend, the Board may set apart, out of any funds of
the Corporation available for dividends, such sum or sums as from time to
time in their discretion may be deemed proper for working capital or as a
reserve fund to meet contingencies or for such other purposes as shall be
deemed conducive to the interests of the Corporation. 

SECTION 47\. FRACTIONAL SHARES. The Company shall have the complete discretion
to issue fractional shares.

at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the

transmission unless so required by the Certificate or these Bylaws.

company (" _Amneal_ ").

 

 _RECITALS_

 

WHEREAS, Holdco and Amneal have entered into a Business Combination Agreement,
dated as of [], 2017 (the " _Business Combination Agreement_ ") with K2
Merger Sub Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Holdco (" _Merger Sub_ ") and Impax Laboratories, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and the sole stockholder of Holdco (" _Impax_ "), pursuant to
which, among other things, as of the date hereof (i) Merger Sub has been
merged with and into Impax, with Impax surviving the merger and continuing as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (the " _Impax Merger_ ") and (ii)
following the Impax Merger, Impax has been converted to a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Conversion_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement of Amneal (the " _Restated Amneal LLC
Operating Agreement_ ") and in exchange for Common Units (as defined in the
Related Amneal LLC Operating Agreement), Holdco wishes to contribute to
Amneal, and Amneal wishes to accept, all of the outstanding equity interests
of Impax (the " _Contributed Equity_ ") and, in connection therewith, to be
admitted as the managing member of Amneal.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements
herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be
legally bound by the terms hereof applicable to each of them, hereby agree as

at any time before or after receipt of the Impax Stockholder Approval;
provided, however, that after the Impax Stockholder Approval has been

Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or in the event, but only in the
event, that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such

proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware) (such
courts, the " _Chosen Courts_ ")). In addition, each of the parties

Courts for the purpose of any litigation directly or indirectly based upon,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transactions or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from the Chosen Courts and (iii) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any
court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any litigation with respect to this Agreement, (x) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts
for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.07(b)_, (y) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in Chosen Courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (z) to the fullest extent permitted by
the applicable Law, any claim that (1) the suit, action or proceeding in such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (2) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding is improper or (3) this Agreement, or the subject matter of this
Agreement, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, hereby irrevocably consents to service
being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.02 of the
Business Combination Agreement and agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by personal delivery to the respective addresses
set forth in Section 9.02 of the Business Combination Agreement shall be
effective service of process for any litigation in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

Section 2.08 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND

such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting. The Board
of Directors may postpone, cancel or reschedule any previously scheduled
annual meeting of stockholders.

 

SECTION 2\. SPECIAL MEETING. A special meeting of the stockholders for any
purpose or purposes may be called at any time only by the President, the
Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or
any other person designated by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors

of stockholders. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders
shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes stated in the
notice of meeting.

 

SECTION 3\. PLACE OF STOCKHOLDER MEETINGS. The Board of Directors, the

as herein provided, whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take
any action at a meeting, whether annual or special, written notice of the

When a meeting is adjourned to reconvene at the same or another place, if any,
or by means of remote communications, if any, in accordance with _Section 6_

voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person, present by

of Directors in its sole discretion, or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that where a separate vote by a class or classes or series of capital stock is
required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series of
the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote on such matter, present in person, present by means of remote
communication in a manner, if any, authorized by the Board of Directors in its
sole discretion, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled
to take action with respect to the vote on such matter. If a quorum is
present in person or represented by proxy at such meeting, such stockholders
may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of such number of stockholders as may leave less than a quorum.

 

SECTION 6\. ADJOURNED MEETINGS. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned
from time to time to any other time and date and to any other place (or by
means of remote communications, if any) at which a meeting of stockholders may
be held under these Bylaws by the chairman of the meeting or by a majority of
the stockholders present or represented at the meeting and entitled to
vote, although less than a quorum. It shall not be necessary to notify any
stockholder of any adjournment of less than 30 days if the time and place, if
any, of the adjourned meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any,

2 SECTION 7\. FIXING OF RECORD DATE.

 

(a) The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as a record date for the
determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any
meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof. Such record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60
days nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date
is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

 

(b) For the purpose of determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is established by the Board of Directors,
and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date on which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no
record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting
forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
office, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book
in which the proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery to
the Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by
the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, the record date for determining stockholders consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be the close of business
on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such
prior action.

 

(c) For the purpose of determining the stockholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or
the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix the record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such
action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining the
stockholders for any such purpose shall be the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



3 SECTION 8\. VOTING LIST. Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address
of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, for a period of at least 10 days prior
to the meeting, (i) by a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with
the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to the stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means
of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Except as otherwise
provided by law, such list shall be the only evidence as to the identity of
stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this
_Section 8_ or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders. The Corporation shall not be required to include electronic
mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.

SECTION 9\. VOTING. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate
of Incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each
share of capital stock held by each stockholder. When a quorum is present at
any meeting, in all matters other than the election of directors, the
affirmative vote of the majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of
stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders, except when a
different vote is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws. When a quorum is present at any meeting, directors shall be elected by
plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by a
proxy at the meeting entitled to vote on the election of directors.

SECTION 10\. PROXIES. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting (including by means of remote communications, if any, by
which stockholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting) may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy
(executed or transmitted in a manner permitted by the Delaware General
Corporation Law), but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly
executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A proxy may remain irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock
itself or an interest in the Corporation generally.

SECTION 11\. RATIFICATION OF ACTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Except as
otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation, any transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the
directors or the officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the
affirmative vote of the holders of the number of shares which would have been
necessary to approve such transaction, contract or act at a meeting of
stockholders, or by the written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting.

 



4 SECTION 12\. CONDUCT OF MEETINGS.

 

(a) _Chairman of Meeting_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the Chairmans absence by the Vice
Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the Vice Chairmans absence by the Chief
Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officers absence, by the
President, or in the Presidents absence by a Vice President, or in the
absence of all of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board
of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen by
vote of the stockholders at the meeting. The Secretary shall act as secretary
of the meeting, but in the Secretarys absence the chairman of the meeting
may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

(b)  _Rules, Regulations and Procedures_. The Board of Directors may adopt by
resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation as it shall deem appropriate
including, without limitation, such guidelines and procedures as it may deem
appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to
the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as
adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders
shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to
recess and/or adjorn the meeting and to prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or
procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i)
the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii)
rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of
those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the

SECTION 13\. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.

meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be delivered to the Corporation
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

 

(b) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would
have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such
meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number
of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation.

 



5 (c) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an
action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxy holder, or by a
person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxy holder, shall
be deemed to be written and signed for the purposes of this section, provided
that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth
or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i)
that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted
by the stockholder or proxy holder or by a person or persons authorized to
act for the stockholder or proxy holder and (ii) the date on which such
stockholder or proxy holder or authorized person or persons transmitted such
telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. No consent given by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been
delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper
form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered
office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or to an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which the
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Any copy, facsimile or
other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or
used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the
original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other
reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the
Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or

have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors
in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may
authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may

recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter (other than the
election or removal of directors) expressly required by law to be submitted to
stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending or repealing any bylaw
of the Corporation. Each such committee shall keep minutes and make such
reports as the Board of Directors may from time to time request. Except as the
Board of Directors may otherwise determine, any committee may make rules for
the conduct of its business, but unless otherwise provided by the directors or

receiving compensation therefore. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom
such person is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such
Indemnified Person in such Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 3 of this Article VI, the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection
with a Proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person
only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the
Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 

SECTION 2\. PREPAYMENT OF EXPENSES OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The Corporation
shall pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnified
Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition,
_provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required by law, such payment of
expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made
only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all
amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise.

 

SECTION 3\. CLAIMS BY DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. If a claim for indemnification
or advancement of expenses under this Article VII is not paid in full within
30 days after a written claim therefor by the Indemnified Person has been
received by the Corporation, the Indemnified Person may file suit to recover
the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall
be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such
action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnified
Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of
expenses under applicable law.

 



14 SECTION 4\. INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. The Corporation may
indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of
the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while
an employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses
(including attorneys fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with such Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to
indemnification of persons who are non-director or officer employees or agents
shall be made in such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in
its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation
shall not be required to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding
initiated by such person if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by
the Board of Directors.

SECTION 5\. ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS. The Corporation
may pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an employee or
agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final disposition on such
terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board of Directors.

 

SECTION 6\. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. The rights conferred on any person by
this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation, these bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

SECTION 7\. OTHER INDEMNIFICATION. The Corporations obligation, if any, to
indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director,
officer or employee of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, trust, organization or other enterprise shall be
reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such
other corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
trust, organization or other enterprise.

SECTION 8\. INSURANCE. The Board of Directors may, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be
amended from time to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to
purchase and maintain at the Corporations expense insurance: (a) to
indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of
the indemnification of directors, officers and employees under the provisions
of this Article VII; and (b) to indemnify or insure directors, officers and
employees against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be
indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article VII.

 

SECTION 9\. AMENDMENT OR REPEAL. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing
provisions of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification. The rights provided
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of any Indemnified Person and such
persons heirs, executors and administrators.

two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such
consent; and

(b) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary
of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for

(c) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; 

(d) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at
which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;

 

(e) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to
the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting

(f) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the
stockholder.

facie_ evidence of the facts stated therein.

warrants, options or other rights or property or (ii) the issuance of Common
Stock pursuant to any Equity Plan that is restricted, subject to forfeiture

(c) The Company shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by equity
split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise)
or combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the outstanding Common Units unless accompanied by an identical

with corresponding changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or
convertible securities. The Corporation shall not in any manner effect any
subdivision (by stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,

Stock unless accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as
applicable, of the outstanding Common Units, with corresponding changes made

distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination

unless accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable,
of the corresponding Equity Securities of the Corporation, with corresponding
changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or convertible securities.
The Corporation shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by stock
split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of any outstanding Equity Securities of the Corporation (other than

Section 3.05 _Repurchases or Redemptions_. The Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (i) any shares
of Class A Common Stock unless substantially simultaneously the Company
redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Corporation an equal
number of Common Units for the same price per security or (ii) any other
Equity Securities of the Corporation unless substantially simultaneously the
Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Corporation an

same price per security from holders thereof, or (B) any other Equity
Securities of the Company from the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries

of such Equity Securities of the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
to the extent that any consideration payable by the Corporation in connection
with the redemption or repurchase of any shares of Class A Common Stock or
other Equity Securities of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries consists
(in whole or in part) of shares of Class A Common Stock or such other Equity
Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with the

shall be effectuated in an equivalent manner.

Section 3.06 _Certificates Representing Units; Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates; Registration and Transfer of Units_.

(a) Units shall not be certificated unless otherwise determined by the
Manager. If the Manager determines that one or more Units shall be
certificated, each such certificate shall be signed by or in the name of the
Company, by the Chief Executive Officer and any other officer designated by
the Manager, representing the number of Units held by such holder. Such
certificate shall be in such form (and shall contain such legends) as the
Manager may determine. Any or all of such signatures on any certificate
representing one or more Units may be a facsimile, engraved or printed, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law. The Manager agrees that it shall not

representing one or more Units be issued in place of any certificate
theretofore issued by the Company alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon delivery to the Manager of an affidavit of the owner or owners

the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal
representative, to give the Company a bond sufficient to indemnify it against
any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of any such new
certificate.

(c) Upon surrender to the Company or the transfer agent of the Company, if
any, of a certificate for one or more Units, duly endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, in
compliance with the provisions hereof, the Company shall issue a new
certificate representing one or more Units to the Person entitled thereto,

such additional rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate relating to
the issue, Transfer and registration of Units.

of such Persons Capital Contribution or Capital Account or to receive any

duly exercised, notwithstanding the amount of the Capital Contribution
actually made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)_, solely for U.S. federal
(and applicable state and local) income tax purposes, the Corporation shall be
deemed to have contributed to the Company as a Capital Contribution, in lieu
of the Capital Contribution actually made and in consideration of additional

as of the date of such exercise multiplied by the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock then being issued by the Corporation in connection with the

transactions shall be deemed to have occurred:

(i) The Corporation shall sell to the Optionee, and the Optionee shall
purchase from the Corporation, for a cash price per share equal to the Value
of a share of Class A Common Stock at the time of the exercise, the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the exercise
price payable by the Optionee in connection with the exercise of such stock
option divided by (y) the Value of a share of Class A Common Stock at the time
of such exercise.

 

(ii) The Corporation shall sell to the Company (or if the Optionee is an
employee of, or other service provider to, a Subsidiary, the Corporation
shall sell to such Subsidiary), and the Company (or such Subsidiary, as
applicable) shall purchase from the Corporation, a number of shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to the excess of (x) the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock as to which such stock option is being exercised over (y) the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock sold pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.10(b)(i)_ hereof. The purchase price per share of Class A Common Stock for

such shares is includible in taxable income of such LLC Employee, the
following events will be deemed to have occurred solely for U.S. federal (and
applicable state and local) income tax purposes: (a) the Corporation shall be

such LLC Employee is an employee of, or other service provider to, a

such shares of Class A Common Stock, (b) the Company (or such Subsidiary)

_Article III_ , all amounts received or deemed received by the Corporation in
respect of any dividend reinvestment plan, cash option

ARTICLE IV

DISTRIBUTIONS

 

Section 4.01 _Distributions_.

 

(a) _Distributable Cash; Other Distributions_. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law and hereunder, Distributions to Members may be declared by the
Manager out of Distributable Cash or other funds or property legally available
therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of
such Distributions) as the Manager shall determine using such record date
as the Manager may designate; such Distributions shall be made to the Members
as of the close of business on such record date on a pro rata basis in
accordance with each Members Percentage Interest as of the close of business
on such record date;  _provided, however_ , that the Manager shall have the
obligation to make Distributions as set forth in _Sections 4.01(b)_ and
_14.02_ ; and _provided further_ that, notwithstanding any other provision
herein to the contrary, no Distributions shall be made to any Member to the
extent such Distribution would violate Section 18-607 or Section 18-804 of the
Delaware Act. Promptly following the designation of a record date and the
declaration of a Distribution pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.01(a)_, the
Manager shall give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and
the terms of the Distribution and the payment date thereof. In furtherance of
the foregoing, it is intended that the Manager shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law and hereunder, have the right in its reasonable discretion
to make Distributions to the Members pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.01(a)_ in such amounts as shall enable the Corporation to pay dividends or
to meet its obligations (to the extent such obligations are not otherwise able
to be satisfied as a result of Tax Distributions required to be made pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 4.01(b)_ or reimbursements required to be made pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 6.06_).

 

(b) _Tax Distributions_. With respect to any tax period (or the portion
thereof) ending after the date hereof:

 

(i) The Company shall make distributions to all Members pro rata, in
accordance with each Members Percentage Interest, on a quarterly basis and
in such amounts as necessary to enable the Corporation to timely (x) satisfy
all of its U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax liabilities, and (y)
meet its obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement.

(ii) If a Member (other than the Corporation) has an Assumed Tax Liability at
a Tax Advance Date in excess of the sum of the amount of distributions under
_Section_ __ _ 4.01(a),_ _Section_ __ _ 4.01(b)(i)_ and any Tax Advances
made to such Member during such taxable year, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, and subject

 



21  to the availability of funds and any restrictions contained in any agreement
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, make advances to
such Member in an amount equal to such excess (a " _Tax Advance_ "). Any such
Tax Advance shall be treated as an advance against and, thus, shall reduce
(without duplication), any future distributions that would otherwise be made
to such Member pursuant to _Sections 4.01(a)_ and _14.02(c)_. If there is a
Tax Advance outstanding with respect to a Member who (x) elects to participate
in a Redemption (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Direct Exchange at
the option of the Corporation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.03_), or (y)
Transfers Units pursuant to the provisions of _Article X_ , then in each case
such Member shall repay to the Company within fifteen (15) days after the
Redemption Date or Date of such Transfer, as the case may be, an amount of
cash equal to the proportionate share of such Tax Advance relating to its
Units subject to the Redemption or Transfer (determined at the time of the
Redemption or Transfer based on the number of Units subject to the Redemption
or Transfer as compared to the total number of Units held by such Member),
provided that, in the case of a Transfer described in _clause (y)_ , such
Member shall not be required to pay such amount of cash equal to
the proportionate share of such Tax Advance relating to its Units subject to
the Transfer, if the transferee agrees to assume the Members obligation to
repay to the Company such amount equal to the proportionate share of the
Members existing Tax Advance relating to such Units subject to the Transfer,
and such Member shall be relieved from any liabilities associated with and the
obligation to repay its existing Tax Advance relating to such Units subject to
the Transfer. The obligations of each Member pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall survive the withdrawal of any Member or the Transfer of any
Members Units and shall apply to any current or former Member. For the
avoidance of doubt, any repayment of a Tax Advance pursuant to the previous
sentence shall not be treated as a Capital Contribution.

(c) _Tax Refunds of the Corporation_. All refunds for taxes received by the
Corporation after the Effective Time that are attributable to taxable periods
(or portions thereof) ending on or before the Effective Time shall be promptly
transferred to the Company for no consideration and no additional Units shall
be issued to the Corporation in respect of any such transfer. Such transfers
shall not constitute Capital Contributions and shall have no effect on the
Capital Accounts of any Member.

 

Section 4.02 _Restricted Distributions_. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not make any
Distribution to any Member on account of any Company Interest if such
Distribution would violate any applicable Law or the terms of the Credit
Agreement or result in a default (or an event that, with notice or the lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) thereunder.

upon the occurrence of the events specified in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), increase or decrease the Capital Accounts in accordance
with the rules of such Treasury Regulations and Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g) to reflect a revaluation of Company property. The Capital
Account balance of each of the Members as of the date hereof, as adjusted in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), is its
respective "Contribution Closing Capital Account Balance" set forth on the
Schedule of Members.

 

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of Company income, gain,
loss or deduction to be allocated pursuant to this _Article V_ and to be
reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Members, the determination,
recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same as its
determination, recognition and classification for U.S. federal income tax
purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
used for this purpose); _provided, however_ , that:

 

(i) The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall
include those items described in 
Code Section 705(a)(l)(B) or Code Section 705(a)(2)(B) and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i), without regard to the fact that such
items are not includable in gross income or are not deductible for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

(ii) If the Book Value of any Company property is adjusted pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e) or (f), the amount of
such adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the
disposition of such property.

 

(iii) Items of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to the disposition
of Company property having a Book Value that differs from its adjusted basis
for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Book Value of such
property.

(iv) In lieu of the depreciation, amortization and other cost recovery
deductions taken into account in computing Profits or Losses, there shall be
taken into account Depreciation for such Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period.

 

(v) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset
pursuant to Code Sections 732(d), 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis).

 

(vi) Items specifically allocated under _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall be
excluded from the computation of Profits and Losses.

Section 5.02 _Allocations_. After giving effect to the allocations under 
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04_, Profits, Losses
and, to the extent necessary, individual items of income, gain, loss, credit
and deduction, for any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period shall be allocated
among the Capital Accounts of the Members on a pro rata basis in accordance
with each Members Percentage Interest.

 



23 Section 5.03 _Regulatory and Special Allocations_.

 

(a) Partner nonrecourse deductions (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(2)) attributable to partner nonrecourse debt (as defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(4)) shall be allocated in the manner
required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If there is a net
decrease during a Taxable Year in Member Minimum Gain, items of Company income
and gain for such Taxable Year (and, if necessary, for subsequent Taxable
Years) shall be allocated to the Members in the amounts and of such character
as determined according to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4).

 

(b) Nonrecourse deductions (as determined according to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-2(b)(1)) for any Taxable Year shall be allocated pro rata among
the Members in accordance with their Percentage Interests. Except as otherwise
provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, if there is a net decrease in the
Company Minimum Gain during any Taxable Year, each Member shall be allocated
items of Company income and gain for such Taxable Year (and, if necessary, for
subsequent Taxable Years) in the amounts and of such character as determined
according to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f). This _Section_ __ _
5.03(b)_ is intended to be a minimum gain chargeback provision that complies
with the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), and shall be
interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

(c) If any Member that unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or
Distribution described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6) has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
as of the end of any Taxable Year, computed after the application of
_Sections 5.03(a)_ and _5.03(b)_ but before the application of any other
provision of this _Article V_ , then items of Company income and gain for such
Taxable Year shall be allocated to such Member in proportion to, and to the
extent of, such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. This _Section_ __ _
5.03(c)_ is intended to be a qualified income offset provision as described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted in
a manner consistent therewith.

(d) If the allocation of Losses to a Member as provided in _Section_ __ _
5.02_ would create or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, there
shall be allocated to such Member only that amount of Losses as will not
create or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. The Losses that
would, absent the application of the preceding sentence, otherwise be
allocated to such Member shall be allocated to the other Members in accordance
with their relative Percentage Interests, subject to this _Section_ __ _
5.03(d)_.

(e) Profits and Losses described in _Section_ __ _ 5.01(b)(v)_ shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with the manner that the adjustments to the
Capital Accounts are required to be made pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(j) and (m).

 

(f) The allocations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ through and
including _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are
intended to comply with certain requirements of Sections 1.704-1(b) and
1.704-2 of the Treasury Regulations. The Regulatory Allocations may not be
consistent with the manner in which the Members intend to allocate Profit and
Loss of the Company or make Distributions. Accordingly, notwithstanding the
other provisions of this _Article V_ , but subject to the Regulatory
Allocations, income, gain, deduction and loss shall be

 



24  reallocated among the Members so as to eliminate the effect of the
Regulatory Allocations and thereby cause the respective Capital Accounts of
the Members to be in the amounts (or as close thereto as possible) they would
have been if Profit and Loss (and such other items of income, gain, deduction
and loss) had been allocated without reference to the Regulatory Allocations.
In general, the Members anticipate that this will be accomplished by
specially allocating other Profit and Loss (and such other items of income,
gain, deduction and loss) among the Members so that the net amount of the
Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each such Member is
zero. In addition, if in any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period there is a
decrease in Company Minimum Gain, or in Member Minimum Gain, and application
of the minimum gain chargeback requirements set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.03(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_ would cause a distortion in the
economic arrangement among the Members, the Members may, if they do not expect
that the Company will have sufficient other income to correct such distortion,
request the Internal Revenue Service to waive either or both of such minimum
gain chargeback requirements. If such request is granted, this Agreement shall
be applied in such instance as if it did not contain such minimum gain
chargeback requirement.

 

Section 5.04 _Tax Allocations_.

 

(a) The income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of the Company will be
allocated, for U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income tax
purposes, among the Members in accordance with the allocation of such income,
gains, losses, deductions and credits among the Members for computing their
Capital Accounts; _provided_ that if any such allocation is not permitted
by the Code or other applicable Law, the Companys subsequent income, gains,
losses, deductions and credits will be allocated among the Members so as to
reflect as nearly as possible the allocation set forth herein in computing
their Capital Accounts.

(b) Items of Company taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to
any property contributed to the capital of the Company shall be allocated
among the Members in accordance with Code Section 704(c) so as to take account
of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company
for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its Book Value in a manner
consistent with Code Section 704(c) and the applicable Regulations using any
method approved under Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder as mutually agreed to by the Manager and APHC (or
its successor). If the Manager and APHC (or its successor) are unable to
agree on such a method, the variation shall be taken into account using the
"traditional method," as described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-3(b).

(c) If the Book Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 5.01(b)_, subsequent allocations of items of taxable income, gain, loss
and deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation
between the adjusted basis of such asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and its Book Value in a manner consistent with Code Section 704(c) and the
applicable Regulations using any method approved under Section 704(c) of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder as mutually agreed
to by the Manager and APHC (or its successor). If the Manager and APHC (or its
successor) are unable to agree on such a method, the variation shall be taken
into account using the "traditional method," as described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b).

 



25 (d) In the event of a Transfer of Units, Profits and Losses and other items of
income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company attributable to such
transferred Units for the Fiscal Period in which such Transfer occurs shall be
determined using either the interim closing of the books method or the
proration method, as mutually agreed to by the Corporation and APHC (or its
successor) for so long as APHC (or its successor) remains a Member and at the
election of the Corporation thereafter.

 

(e) If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory option to acquire an
interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation is required under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ )(3), the Company shall
make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

(f) Allocations of tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items related
thereto shall be allocated to the Members pro rata as determined by the
Manager taking into account the principles of Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).

 

(g) Each Members share of the Companys "excess nonrecourse liabilities"
shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.752-3(a)(3) using a method mutually agreed to by the Manager and APHC (or
its successor). If the Manager and APHC (or its successor) are unable to agree
on such a method, the Companys excess nonrecourse liabilities shall be
allocated to the Members using the "additional method," as described in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3).

 

(h) Allocations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ are solely for purposes
of U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income taxes and shall not
affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Members Capital
Account or share of Profits, Losses, Distributions or other Company items
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.05 _Withholding; Reimbursement for Payments on Behalf of a Member_.
The Company and its Subsidiaries may withhold from distributions, allocations
or portions thereof if it is required to do so by any applicable Law, and each
Member hereby authorizes the Company and its Subsidiaries to withhold or pay
on behalf of or with respect to such Member any amount of U.S. federal,
state, or local or non-U.S. taxes that the Manager determines, in good faith,
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to withhold or pay
with respect to any amount distributable or allocable to such Member pursuant
to this Agreement. In addition, if the Company is obligated to pay any other
amount to a Governmental Entity (or otherwise makes a payment to a
Governmental Entity) that is specifically attributable to a Member (including
U.S. federal income taxes as a result of Company obligations pursuant to the
Revised Partnership Audit Provisions with respect to items of income, gain,
loss deduction or credit allocable or attributable to such Member, state
personal property taxes and state unincorporated business taxes, but
excluding payments such as professional association fees and the like made
voluntarily by the Company on behalf of any Member based upon such Members
status as an employee of the Company), then such tax shall be treated as an
amount of taxes withheld or paid with respect to such Member pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_. For all purposes under this Agreement, any amounts
withheld or paid with respect to a Member pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.05_ shall be treated as having been distributed to such Member at the time
such withholding or payment is made. Further, to the extent that the
cumulative amount of such withholding or payment for any period

 



26  exceeds the distributions to which such Member is entitled for such period,
such Member shall reimburse the Company in full for the amount of such excess.
The Manager may offset Distributions to which a Person is otherwise entitled
under this Agreement against such Persons obligation to reimburse the Company
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_. A Members obligation to reimburse the
Company under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_ shall survive the termination,
dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company, and for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, the Company shall be treated as continuing in
existence. The Company may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may
have against each Member under this _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, including
instituting a lawsuit to collect amounts owed under such reimbursement
obligation with interest accruing from the date such withholding or payment
is made by the Company at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (but not in
excess of the highest rate per annum permitted by Law). Any income from such
reimbursement (and interest) shall not be allocated to or distributed to the
Member reimbursing such amount (and interest). Each Member hereby agrees to
furnish to the Company such information and forms as required or reasonably
requested in order to comply with any laws and regulations governing
withholding of tax or in order to claim any reduced rate of, or exemption
from, withholding to which the Member is legally entitled.

 

ARTICLE VI

MANAGEMENT

 

Section 6.01 _Authority of Manager_.

 

(a) Except for situations in which the approval of any Member(s) is
specifically required by this Agreement and for situations in which
the approval of the Conflicts Committee is required pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) all
management powers over the business and affairs of the Company shall be
exclusively vested in the Corporation, as the sole managing member of the
Company (the Corporation, in such capacity, or any other Person appointed in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.04_, the " _Manager_ ") and (ii) the
Manager shall conduct, direct and exercise full control over all activities
of the Company. The Manager shall be the "manager" of the Company for the
purposes of the Delaware Act. Except as otherwise expressly provided for
herein and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Members
hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of all such powers and rights
conferred on the Members by the Delaware Act with respect to the management
and control of the Company. Any vacancies in the position of Manager shall be
filled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

(b) The day-to-day business and operations of the Company shall be overseen
and implemented by officers of the Company (each, an " _Officer_ "
and collectively, the " _Officers_ "), subject to the limitations imposed by
the Manager. An Officer may, but need not, be a Member. Each Officer shall be
appointed by the Manager and shall hold office until his or her
successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her
death or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner
hereinafter provided. Any one Person may hold more than one office. Subject to
the other provisions in this Agreement (including in _Section_ __ _ 6.07_
below), the salaries or other compensation, if any, of the Officers of the
Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Manager. The authority and
responsibility of the Officers shall include, but not be limited to, such
duties as the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to them and the
carrying out of the Companys business and affairs on a day-to-day basis. An
Officer may

 



27  also perform one or more roles as an officer of the Manager. The Manager may
remove any Officer from office at any time, with or without cause. If any
vacancy shall occur in any office, for any reason whatsoever, then the
Manager shall have the right to appoint a new Officer to fill the vacancy.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at the Effective Time, the
Manager shall appoint the chief executive officer of the Corporation to serve
as the chief executive officer of the Company until his death or until he
shall resign or shall have been removed by the Manager in the manner provided
herein.

 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Manager shall have
the power and authority to effectuate the sale, lease, transfer, exchange or
other disposition of any, all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company (including the exercise or grant of any conversion, option, privilege
or subscription right or any other right available in connection with any
assets at any time held by the Company) or the merger, consolidation,
reorganization or other combination of the Company with or into another
entity.

 

Section 6.02 _Actions of the Manager_. The Manager may act through any Officer
or through any other Person or Persons to whom authority and duties have been
delegated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.07_.

Section 6.03 _Resignation; No Removal_. The Corporation shall not, by any
means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as the Manager except in
compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.03_. No termination or replacement of
the Corporation as the Manager shall be effective unless proper provision is
made, in compliance with this Agreement, so that the obligations of the
Corporation (or its successor, if applicable) and any new Manager and the
rights of all Members under this Agreement and applicable Law remain in full
force and effect. No appointment of a Person other than the Corporation (or
its successor, as applicable) as the Manager shall be effective unless the
Corporation (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Manager (as
applicable) provide all of the other Members with contractual rights,
directly enforceable by such other Members against the Corporation (or its
successor, as applicable) and the new Manager (as applicable), to cause (a)
the Corporation to comply with all of the Corporations obligations under
this Agreement (including its obligations under _Article XI_ ) other than
those that must necessarily be taken in its capacity as the Manager and (b)
the new Manager to comply with all of the Managers obligations under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members have no right under this
Agreement to remove or replace the Manager.

 

Section 6.04 _Vacancies_. Vacancies in the position of Manager occurring for
any reason shall be filled by the Corporation (or, if the Corporation has
ceased to exist without any successor or assign, then by the holders of a
majority in interest of the voting capital stock of the Corporation
immediately prior to such cessation). For the avoidance of doubt, the Members
(other than the Corporation) have no right under this Agreement to fill any
vacancy in the position of Manager.

Section 6.05  _Transactions Between Company and Manager_. The Manager may
cause the Company to contract and deal with the Manager, or any Affiliate of
the Manager; _provided_ that such contracts and dealings are on terms
comparable to and competitive with those available to the Company from others
dealing at arms length or are approved by the Members (other than the Manager
and its controlled Affiliates) holding a majority of the Units (excluding
Units held 

 



28  by the Manager and its controlled Affiliates) then outstanding and, in any
case, would not violate any provisions of or result in a default (or an event
that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under the Credit Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such
contracts and dealings that are deemed Related Party Transactions (as defined
in the Stockholders Agreement) shall be subject to Conflicts Committee
approval.

Section 6.06 _Reimbursement for Expenses_. The Manager shall not be
compensated for its services as Manager of the Company except as expressly
provided in this Agreement. The Members acknowledge and agree that the
Managers Class A Common Stock is and will continue to be publicly traded and
therefore the Manager will have access to the public capital markets and that
such status and the services performed by the Manager will inure to the
benefit of the Company and all Members; therefore, the Manager shall be
reimbursed by the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
on behalf of the Company, including all fees, expenses and costs of being a
public company (including public reporting obligations, proxy statements,
stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees, SEC and FINRA
filing fees and offering expenses) and maintaining its existence as a separate
legal entity, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any payment
obligations of the Corporation under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In the
event that (i) shares of Class A Common Stock were sold to underwriters in the
initial public offering of the Corporation or are sold to underwriters in any
public offering after the Effective Time, in each case, at a price per share
that is lower than the price per share for which such shares of Class A Common
Stock are sold to the public in such public offering after taking into account
underwriters discounts or commissions and brokers fees or commissions (such
difference, the " _Discount_ ") and (ii) the proceeds from such public
offering are used to fund the Cash Settlement for any Redeemed Units or
otherwise contributed to the Company, the Company shall reimburse the Manager
for such Discount by treating such Discount as an additional Capital
Contribution made by the Manager to the Company, issuing Common Units in
respect of such deemed Capital Contribution in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.02_, and increasing the Managers Capital Account by the amount of such
Discount. To the extent practicable, expenses incurred by the Manager on
behalf of or for the benefit of the Company shall be billed directly to and
paid by the Company and, if and to the extent any reimbursements to the
Manager or any of its Affiliates by the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.06_ constitute gross income to such Person (as opposed to the repayment
of advances made by such Person on behalf of the Company), such amounts shall
be treated as "guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Code Section 707(c)
and shall not be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the
Members Capital Accounts.

Section 6.07 _Delegation of Authority_. The Manager (a) may, from time to
time, delegate to one or more Persons such authority and duties as the Manager
may deem advisable, and (b) may assign titles (including chief executive
officer, president, chief executive officer, chief financial officers, chief
operating officer, vice president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer
or assistant treasurer) and delegate certain authority and duties to such
Persons as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time. Any number of titles may be held by the same
individual. The salaries or other compensation, if any, of such agents of the
Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Manager, subject to the other
provisions in this Agreement. 

 



29 Section 6.08 _Limitation of Liability of Manager_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein or in an agreement entered into by
such Person and the Company, neither the Manager nor any of the Managers
Affiliates shall be liable to the Company or to any Member that is not the
Manager for any act or omission performed or omitted by the Manager in its
capacity as the sole managing member of the Company pursuant to authority
granted to the Manager by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that, except
as otherwise provided herein, such limitation of liability shall not apply to
the extent the act or omission was attributable to the Managers or its
Affiliates or their respective agents bad faith, willful misconduct or
violation of Law in which the Manager or such Affiliate or their respective
agents acted with knowledge that its conduct was unlawful, or for any present
or future breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations by the Manager or its Affiliates contained herein or in the other
agreements with the Company. The Manager may exercise any of the powers
granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it
hereunder either directly or by or through its agents, and, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, shall not be responsible for any
misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent (so long as such agent
was selected in good faith and with reasonable care). The Manager shall be
entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts, including financial advisors, and any act of or
failure to act by the Manager in good faith reliance on such advice shall in
no event subject the Manager to liability to the Company or any Member that is
not the Manager.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, whenever in this Agreement the Manager
is permitted or required to take any action or to make a decision in its
"good faith" or under another express standard, the Manager shall act under
such express standard and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein, and, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, so long as the Manager acts in good
faith, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by
the Manager shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated herein or impose liability upon the Manager or any of
the Managers Affiliates.

 

Section 6.09 _Investment Company Act_. The Manager shall use its best efforts
to ensure that the Company shall not be subject to registration as an
investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act.

Section 6.10 _Outside Activities of the Manager_. The Manager shall not,
directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any business or operations,
other than in connection with (a) the ownership, acquisition and disposition
of Common Units, (b) the management of the business and affairs of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (c) the operation of the Manager as a reporting
company with a class (or classes) of securities registered under Section 12 of
the Exchange Act and listed on a securities exchange, (d) the offering, sale,
syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities
or other interests, (e) financing or refinancing of any type related to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their assets or activities, and (f)
such activities as are incidental to the foregoing; _provided, however_ ,
that, except as otherwise provided herein, the net proceeds of any sale of
Equity Securities of the Corporation pursuant to the preceding clauses (d) and
(e) shall be made available to the Company as Capital Contributions and the
proceeds of any other financing raised by the Manager pursuant to the
preceding clauses (d) and (e) shall be made available to the Company as loans
or otherwise as appropriate and,  _provided further_ , that

 



30  the Manager may, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time hold
or acquire assets in its own name or otherwise other than through the Company
and its Subsidiaries so long as the Manager takes all necessary measures to
ensure that the economic benefits and burdens of such assets are otherwise
vested in the Company or its Subsidiaries, through assignment, mortgage loan
or otherwise. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the
Manager from executing any guarantee of indebtedness of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

Section 6.11 _Standard of Care_. Subject to the second sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11_, the Manager shall, in connection with the performance
of its duties in its capacity as the Manager, have the same fiduciary duties
to the Company and the Members as would be owed to a Delaware corporation and
its stockholders by its directors, and shall be entitled to the benefit of the
same presumptions in carrying out such duties as would be afforded to a
director of a Delaware corporation (as such duties and presumptions are
defined, described and explained under the Laws of the State of Delaware as in
effect from time to time). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, the Manager shall not be liable to the Company or its
Members for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty that would be
owed to a Delaware corporation and its stockholders by its directors;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this, limitation of liability shall not
eliminate or limit the liabilities of the Manager for any breach of the duty
of loyalty to the Company or its Members or for acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.
The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or
eliminate the duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities of the
Manager otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Members to
replace, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, such other duties
and liabilities of the Manager.

ARTICLE VII

 

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

 

Section 7.01 _Limitation of Liability and Duties of Members; Investment
Opportunities_.

 

(a) Except as provided in this Agreement or in the Delaware Act, no Member
(including the Manager) shall be obligated personally for any
debt, obligation or liability solely by reason of being a Member or acting as
the Manager of the Company; _provided_ that, in the case of the Manager, and
subject to the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, this sentence
shall not in any manner limit the liability of the Manager to the Company or
any Member (other than the Manager) attributable to a breach by the Manager of
any obligations of the Manager under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the failure of the Company to observe any
formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or
management of its business and affairs under this Agreement or the Delaware
Act shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability on the Members for
liabilities of the Company.

(b) In accordance with the Delaware Act and the laws of the State of Delaware,
a Member may, under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts
previously distributed to such Member. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, it is the intent of the Members that no Distribution to any
Member pursuant to  _Article IV_ shall be deemed a return of money or other
property paid or distributed in violation of the Delaware Act. The payment of
any such money or Distribution of any such property to a Member shall be
deemed to be a 

 



31  compromise within the meaning of Section 18-502(b) of the Delaware Act, and,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Member receiving any such money
or property shall not be required to return any such money or property to the
Company or any other Person. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction
holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Member is
obligated to make any such payment, such obligation shall be the obligation
of such Member and not of any other Member.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (subject to
_Section_ __ _ 6.08_ and except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, in
each case, with respect to the Manager), to the extent that, at law or in
equity, any Member (or such Members Affiliate or any manager, managing
member, general partner, director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary or
trustee of such Member or of any Affiliate of such Member (each Person
described in this parenthetical, a " _Related_ _Person_ ")) has duties
(including fiduciary duties (other than any fiduciary duty owed by such Member
or Related Person to the Corporation)) to the Company, to the Manager, to
another Member, to any Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest
or to any other Person bound by this Agreement, all such duties are hereby
eliminated, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and replaced with the
duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if any. The elimination of
duties to the Company, the Manager, each of the Members, each other Person who
acquires an interest in a Company Interest and each other Person bound by this
Agreement and replacement thereof with the duties or standards expressly set
forth herein, if any, are approved by the Company, the Manager, each of the
Members, each other Person who acquires an interest in a Company Interest and
each other Person bound by this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary duty) otherwise
applicable at law or in equity, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
analogous doctrine, will not apply to any Member (including the Corporation in
its capacity as a Member or as Manager) or to any Related Person of such
Member, and no Member (or any Related Person of such Member) that acquires
knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter
that may be an opportunity for the Company or the Members will have any duty
to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Company or the Members, or to
develop any particular investment, and such Person will not be liable to the
Company or the Members for breach of any fiduciary or other duty (other than
any fiduciary duty owed by such Person to the Corporation) by reason of the
fact that such Person pursues or acquires for, or directs such opportunity
to, another Person or does not communicate such investment opportunity to the
Members. Notwithstanding any duty (including any fiduciary duty (other than
any fiduciary duty owed to the Corporation)) otherwise applicable at law or
in equity, neither the Company nor any Member has any rights or obligations by
virtue of this Agreement or the relationships created hereby in or to such
independent ventures or the income or profits or losses derived
therefrom, and the pursuit of any such ventures outside the Company, even if
competitive with the activities of the Company or the Members, will not be
deemed wrongful or improper.

 

Section 7.02 _Lack of Authority_. No Member, other than the Manager or a duly
appointed Officer, in each case in its capacity as such, has the authority or
power to act for or on behalf of the Company, to do any act that would be
binding on the Company or to make any expenditure on behalf of the Company.
The Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of the
powers conferred on the Manager by Law and this Agreement.

 



32 Section 7.03 _No Right of Partition_. No Member shall have the right to seek
or obtain partition by court decree or operation of Law of any Company
property, or the right to own or use particular or individual assets of the
Company.

 

Section 7.04 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless any Person (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to the
fullest extent permitted under the Delaware Act, as the same now exists or may
hereafter be amended, substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such
amendment, substitution or replacement only to the extent that such
amendment, substitution or replacement permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than the Company is providing immediately prior to such
amendment), against all expenses, liabilities, damages and losses (including
attorneys fees, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines, excise taxes,
interest or penalties) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or one
or more of such Persons Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such Person
is or was serving as the Manager or Officer of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a manager, officer, director,
principal or member of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
limited liability company, trust or other enterprise; _provided, however_ ,
that no Indemnified Person shall be indemnified for any expenses, liabilities
and losses suffered that are attributable to such Indemnified Persons or its
Affiliates bad faith, willful misconduct or violation of Law in which such
Indemnified Person or such Affiliate acted with knowledge that its conduct was
unlawful, or for any present or future breaches of any representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations by such Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.
Expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person
in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the
final disposition of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

(b) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, bylaw,
action by the Manager or otherwise.

(c) The Company shall maintain directors and officers liability insurance,
or substantially equivalent insurance, at its expense, to protect any
Indemnified Person (and the investment funds, if any, they represent) against
any expense, liability or loss described in _Section_ __ _ 7.04(a)_ whether
or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such Indemnified Person
against such expense, liability or loss under the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 7.04_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
purchase and maintain property, casualty and liability insurance in types and
at levels customary for companies of similar size engaged in similar lines of
business, as determined in good faith by the Manager, and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase directors and officers
liability insurance (including employment practices coverage) with a carrier
and in an amount that is necessary or desirable as determined in good faith by
the Manager.

 



33 (d) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by the Company
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall be provided out of and to the
extent of Company assets only and no Member (unless such Member otherwise
agrees in writing or is found in a final decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have personal liability on account thereof) shall have
personal liability on account thereof or shall be required to make additional
Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company.

(e) If this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated
on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall
nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable
portion of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ that shall not have been invalidated
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 7.05 _Members Right to Act_. For matters that require the approval of
the Members, the Members shall act through meetings and written consents as
described in paragraphs (a) and (b) below:

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, acts by the
Members holding a majority of the outstanding Units, voting together as a
single class, shall be the acts of the Members. Any Member entitled to vote at
a meeting of Members may authorize another person or persons to act for it by
proxy. An electronic mail, telegram, telex, cablegram or similar transmission
by the Member, or a photographic, photostatic, facsimile or similar
reproduction of a writing executed by the Member shall (if stated thereon) be
treated as a proxy executed in writing for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
7.05(a)_. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven (11) months from
the date thereof, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall
be revocable unless the proxy form conspicuously states that the proxy is
irrevocable and that the proxy is coupled with an interest. Should a proxy
designate two or more Persons to act as proxies, unless that instrument shall
provide to the contrary, a majority of such Persons present at any meeting at
which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise
all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or, if only one
be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even
number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, the Company
shall not be required to recognize such proxy with respect to such issue if
such proxy does not specify how the votes that are the subject of such
proxy are to be voted with respect to such issue.

(b) The actions by the Members permitted hereunder may be taken at a meeting
called by the Manager or by the Members holding a majority of the Units
entitled to vote on such matter on at least forty eight (48) hours prior
written notice to the other Members entitled to vote, which notice shall state
the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is being called. The actions
taken by the Members entitled to vote or consent at any meeting (as opposed to
by written consent), however called and noticed, shall be as valid as though
taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if (but not
until), either before, at or after the meeting, the Members entitled to vote
or consent as to whom it was improperly held signs a written waiver of notice
or a consent to the holding of such meeting or an approval of the minutes
thereof. The actions by the Members entitled to vote or consent may be taken
by vote of the Members entitled to vote or consent at a meeting or by written
consent, so long as such consent is signed by Members having not less than the
minimum number of Units that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all Members entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted. Prompt notice of the action so taken, which shall state the purpose
or purposes for which such consent is required and may be delivered via
email, without a meeting shall be given to those Members entitled to vote or
consent who have not consented in writing; _provided, however_ , that the
failure to give any such notice shall not affect the validity of the action
taken by such written consent. Any action taken pursuant to such written
consent of the Members shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
Members at a meeting thereof.

 



34 Section 7.06 _Inspection Rights_. The Company shall permit each Member and
each of its designated representatives to (i) visit and inspect any of the
properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all at reasonable times and
upon reasonable notice, (ii) examine the corporate and financial records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and make copies thereof or extracts
therefrom, (iii) consult with the managers, officers, employees and
independent accountants of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries concerning
the affairs, finances and accounts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The presentation of an executed copy of this Agreement by any Member to the
Companys independent accountants shall constitute the Companys permission to
its independent accountants to participate in discussions with such Persons
and their respective designated representatives.

determination of the relative amount of allocations and Distributions among
the Members pursuant to _Articles III_ and _IV_ and (b) accounting procedures

(a) With respect to Tax Years beginning on or before December 31, 2017, the

authorized and required to represent the Company (at the Companys expense)
in connection with all examinations of the Companys affairs by tax
authorities, including resulting administrative and judicial proceedings, and

with respect to the conduct of such proceedings. The Tax Matters Partners
shall keep all Members fully advised on a current basis of any contacts by or
discussions with the tax authorities, and the Members shall have the right to
observe and participate through representatives of their own choosing (at
their sole expense) in any tax proceedings. Nothing herein shall diminish,

Regulations Section 1.752-1(a)(2).

 

ARTICLE X

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF UNITS

Section 10.01 _Transfers by Members_. No holder of Units may Transfer any
interest in any Units, except Transfers (a) pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 10.02_ or (b) approved in writing by the Manager (other
than any Transfer by the Manager). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
"Transfer" shall not include an event that terminates the existence of a
Member for income tax purposes (including, without limitation, a change in
entity classification of a Member under Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3, termination of a partnership pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of
the Code, a sale of assets by, or liquidation of, a Member pursuant to an
election under Section 338 of the Code, or merger, severance, or allocation
within a trust or among sub-trusts of a trust that is a Member), but that does
not terminate the existence of such Member under applicable state law (or, in
the case of a trust that is a Member, does not terminate the trusteeship of
the fiduciaries under such trust with respect to all the Company Interests of
such trust that is a Member) and (ii) this _Article X_ shall not restrict any
Redemption pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ or exchange pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.03_.

 



37 Section 10.02 _Permitted Transfers_. The restrictions contained in  _Section_
__ _ 10.01_ shall not apply to any Transfer (each, a " _Permitted Transfer_
") (i) by a Member to an Affiliate of such Member, (ii) by any Original Member
or any direct or (through a subsequent transfer) indirect transferee of such
Original Member (A) with the prior written consent of the Conflicts Committee,
(B) in response to a tender or exchange offer that has been approved or
recommended by the Corporate Board, (C) in connection with any Company Sale
(as defined in the Stockholders Agreement), (D) that is an individual, (1) to
such Original Members (or such transferees) spouse, (2) to such Original
Members (or such transferees) lineal ancestors, lineal descendants,
siblings, cousins or the spouses thereof, (3) to trusts for the benefit of
such Original Member (or such transferee) or such persons, (4) to foundations
established by such Original Member (or such transferee) or such persons or
Affiliates thereof or (5) by way of bequest or inheritance upon death, (E)
that is an entity, to such Original Members (or such transferees) members,
partners or other equity holders or (F) of up to a total of 60,000,000 Common
Units (as adjusted for any equity split, equity distribution,
recapitalization, combination, reclassification or similar change in the
capital structure of the Company following the date hereof) in the aggregate
for all Members collectively pursuant to one or more PIPE Transactions (as
defined in the Stockholders Agreement) (without duplication of the foregoing
clauses (A) through (E)) or (iii) pursuant to a Redemption or Direct
Exchange in accordance with _Article XI_ hereof; _provided, however_ , that
the restrictions contained in this Agreement shall continue to apply to Units
after any Permitted Transfer of such Units. In the case of any Permitted
Transfer in accordance with clauses (i) or (ii) of the definition of
"Permitted Transfer", (A) the transferor shall deliver a written notice to the
Company and the Members, which notice will disclose in reasonable detail the
identity of the proposed transferee, and (B) any such transferees of Units
Transferred in such Permitted Transfer shall agree in writing to be bound by
the provisions of this Agreement. In the case of a Permitted Transfer (other
than a Redemption or Direct Exchange) by any Original Member of Common Units
to a transferee in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 10.02_, such Member
(or any subsequent transferee of such Member) shall be required to also
Transfer a number of shares of Class B Common Stock corresponding to the
number of such Members (or subsequent transferees) Common Units that were
Transferred in the transaction to such transferee; and, in the case of a
Redemption or Direct Exchange, a number of shares of Class B Common Stock
corresponding to the number of such Members Common Units that were
Transferred in such Redemption or Direct Exchange shall be cancelled. All
Permitted Transfers are subject to the additional limitations set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 10.07(b)_ hereof (other than _Section_ __ _ 10.07(b)(iii)_)
and Section 4.1 of the Stockholders Agreement.

 

Section 10.03 _Restricted Units Legend_. The Units have not been registered
under the Securities Act and, therefore, in addition to the other
restrictions on Transfer contained in this Agreement, cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is then available. To the extent such Units have been
certificated, each certificate evidencing Units and each certificate issued
in exchange for or upon the Transfer of any Units (if such securities remain
Units as defined herein after such Transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise
imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:

 



38 "THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED ON [
], 2017, AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE " _ACT_ "), AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE ACT OR AN EXEMPTION FROM
REGISTRATION THEREUNDER. THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE
ALSO SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER SPECIFIED IN THE THIRD
AMENDED AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF AMNEAL
PHARMACEUTICALS LLC, AS MAY BE AMENDED AND MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND
AMNEAL PHARMACEUTICALS LLC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE THE TRANSFER OF SUCH
SECURITIES UNTIL SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED WITH RESPECT TO
ANY TRANSFER. A COPY OF SUCH CONDITIONS SHALL BE FURNISHED BY AMNEAL
PHARMACEUTICALS LLC TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON WRITTEN REQUEST AND WITHOUT
CHARGE."

 

The Company shall imprint such legend on certificates (if any) evidencing
Units. The legend set forth above shall be removed from the certificates (if
any) evidencing any units which cease to be Units in accordance with the
definition thereof.

Section 10.04 _Transfer_. Prior to Transferring any Units (other than (i) in
connection with a Redemption or Direct Exchange in accordance with _Article
XI_ or (ii) pursuant to a Change of Control Transaction), the Transferring
holder of Units shall cause the prospective transferee to be bound by this
Agreement and any other agreements executed by the holders of Units and
relating to such Units in the aggregate (collectively, the " _Other
Agreements_ "), and shall cause the prospective transferee to execute and
deliver to the Company and the other holders of Units a Joinder (or other
counterpart to this Agreement reasonably acceptable to the Manager) and
counterparts of any applicable Other Agreements. Any Transfer or attempted
Transfer of any Units in violation of any provision of this Agreement
(including any prohibited indirect Transfers) (a) shall be void, and (b) the
Company shall not record such Transfer on its books or treat any
purported transferee of such Units as the owner of such securities for any
purpose.

Section 10.05 _Assignee_ __ _s Rights_. 

(a) The Transfer of a Company Interest in accordance with this Agreement shall
be effective as of the date of its assignment (assuming compliance with all
of the conditions to such Transfer set forth herein), and such Transfer shall
be shown on the Schedule of Members. Profits, Losses and other Company items
shall be allocated between the transferor and the Assignee according to Code
Section 706, using any permissible method as determined in the reasonable
discretion of the Manager. Distributions made before the effective date of
such Transfer shall be paid to the transferor, and Distributions made after
such date shall be paid to the Assignee.

 



39 (b) Unless and until an Assignee becomes a Member pursuant to _Article XII_ ,
the Assignee shall not be entitled to any of the rights granted to a Member
hereunder or under applicable Law, other than the rights granted specifically
to Assignees pursuant to this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that, without
relieving the transferring Member from any such limitations or obligations as
more fully described in _Section_ __ _ 10.06_, such Assignee shall be bound
by any limitations and obligations of a Member contained herein that a Member
would be bound on account of the Assignees Company Interest (including the
obligation to make Capital Contributions on account of such Company Interest).

 

Section 10.06 _Assignor_ __ _s Rights and Obligations_. Any Member who shall
Transfer any Company Interest in a manner in accordance with this Agreement
shall cease to be a Member with respect to such Units or other interest and
shall no longer have any rights or privileges, or, except as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.06_, duties, liabilities or obligations, of a Member with
respect to such Units or other interest (it being understood, however, that
the applicable provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, _Section_ __ _ 7.01_
and  _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ shall continue to inure to such Persons benefit),
except that unless and until the Assignee (if not already a Member) is
admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with the provisions of
_Article XII_ (the " _Admission Date_ "), (i) such assigning Member shall
retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member with respect
to such Units or other interest, and (ii) the Manager may, in its
sole discretion, reinstate all or any portion of the rights and privileges of
such Member with respect to such Units or other interest for any period of
time prior to the Admission Date. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any
Member who Transfers any Units or other interest in the Company from any
liability of such Member to the Company with respect to such Company Interest
that may exist on the Admission Date or that is otherwise specified in the
Delaware Act and incorporated into this Agreement or for any liability to the
Company or any other Person for any materially false statement made by such
Member (in its capacity as such) or for any present or future breaches of any
representations, warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity as
such) contained herein or in the other agreements with the Company.

Section 10.07 _Overriding Provisions_. 

(a) Any Transfer in violation of this _Article X_ shall be null and void ab
initio, and the provisions of _Sections 10.05_ and  _10.06_ shall not apply
to any such Transfers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person to whom a
Transfer is made or attempted in violation of this _Article X_ shall not
become a Member, shall not be entitled to vote on any matters coming before
the Members and shall not have any other rights in or with respect to any
rights of a Member of the Company. The approval of any Transfer in any one or
more instances shall not limit or waive the requirement for such approval in
any other or future instance. The Manager shall promptly amend the Schedule
of Members to reflect any Permitted Transfer pursuant to this _Article X_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.01_ and
_Article XI_ and _Article XII_ ), in no event shall any Member Transfer any
Units to the extent such Transfer would:

 

(i) result in the violation of the Securities Act, or any other applicable
U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. Laws;

(ii) subject the Company to registration as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act;

 



40 (iii) in the reasonable determination of the Manager, be a violation of or
a default (or an event that, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under, or result in an acceleration of any indebtedness
under, any promissory note, mortgage, loan agreement, indenture or similar
instrument or agreement to which the Company or the Manager is a party;
_provided_ that the payee or creditor to whom the Company or the Manager owes
such obligation is not an Affiliate of the Company or the Manager; _provided_
, _further_ , this  _Section_ __ _ 10.07(b)(iii)_ shall not apply to any
Permitted Transfer;

(iv) fail to meet one or more of the "secondary market safe harbors"
described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.7704-1(e) (regarding transfers
not involving trading, such as, for example certain gift transfers certain
carryover basis transfers and certain transfers involving blocks of interests
representing more than two percent (2%) of the total interests in the
Companys capital or profits), 1.7704-1(f) (regarding transfers pursuant to
certain redemption and repurchase agreements), 1.7704-1(g) (regarding
transfers through qualified matching services), or 1.7704-1(j) (regarding
transfers where there is a lack of actual trading (that is, trading in the
aggregate representing two percent (2%) or less of the total interests in the
Companys capital or profits in a taxable year)), and, accordingly, in no
event shall the Company recognize any Transfer of any Units in a taxable
year, other than those Transfers that are described in Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.7704-1(e)(1)(i)-(vii), 1.7704-1(e)(1)(ix), 1.7704-1(f), or
1.7704-1(g), to the extent such Transfers in the aggregate for such taxable
year would exceed two percent (2%) of the total interests in the Companys
capital or profits as determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.7704-1(j) and 1.7704-1(k); _provided_ that the prohibitions
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.07(b)(iv)_ shall not apply to any
Transfer occurring in any taxable year in which the Company did not have more
than one hundred (100) partners within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(1) (determined by treating each Person that owns an
interest in a Member that is a partnership, S corporation, or grantor trust
for federal income tax purposes as a partner pursuant to Treasury Regulations

Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, or any successor provision of the
Code; _provided_ , _further_ , this _Section_ __ _ 10.07(b)(v)_ shall apply
to any transaction that would be a transfer for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, even if such transfer is not a Transfer as defined herein, or

(vi) be a Transfer to a Person who is not legally competent or who has not
achieved his or her majority under applicable Law (excluding trusts for the

REDEMPTION AND EXCHANGE RIGHTS

 

Section 11.01 _Redemption Right of a Member_.

 

(a) Each Member (other than the Corporation) shall be entitled to cause the
Company to redeem (a " _Redemption_ ") all or any portion of its Common Units
(the " _Redemption Right_ ") at any time. A Member desiring to exercise its
Redemption Right (the " _Redeemed Member_ ") shall exercise such right by
giving written notice (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") to the Company with a
copy to the Corporation (the date of the delivery of such Redemption Notice,
the " _Redemption Notice Date_ "). The Redemption Notice shall specify the
number of Common Units (the " _Redeemed Units_ ") that the Redeemed Member
intends to have the Company redeem. The Redemption shall be completed on the
date that is three (3) Business Days following delivery of the
applicable Redemption Notice, unless the Company elects to make the
redemption payment by means of a Cash Settlement, in which case the Redemption
shall be completed as promptly as practicable following delivery of the
applicable Redemption Notice, but in any event, no more than ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such Redemption Notice (unless and to the
extent that the Manager in its reasonable discretion agrees in writing to
waive such time periods) (the date of such completion, the " _Redemption
Date_ "); _provided_ that the Company, the Corporation and the Redeemed Member
may change the number of Redeemed Units and/or the Redemption Date specified
in such Redemption Notice to another number and/or date by mutual agreement
in writing signed by each of them; _provided further_ that a Redemption Notice
may be conditioned on the closing of an underwritten distribution of the
shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued in connection with such
proposed Redemption. Unless the Redeemed Member timely has delivered a
Retraction Notice as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ or has delayed a
Redemption as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_ or the Corporation has
elected to effect a Direct Exchange as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, on
the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of
business on the Redemption Date) (i) the Redeemed Member shall transfer and
surrender the Redeemed Units to the Company and a corresponding number of
shares of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation, in each case free and clear
of all liens and encumbrances, (ii) the Company shall (x) cancel the Redeemed
Units, (y) transfer to the Redeemed Member the consideration to which the
Redeemed Member is entitled under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_, and (z) if
the Units are certificated, issue to the Redeemed Member a certificate for a
number of Common Units equal to the difference (if any) between the number of
Common Units evidenced by the certificate surrendered by the Redeemed Member
pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_ and the Redeemed
Units and (iii) the Corporation shall cancel such shares of Class B Common
Stock.

 

(b) In exchange for its Redeemed Units, a Redeemed Member shall be entitled to
receive the Share Settlement or, at the Companys election, the Cash
Settlement from the Company. Within one (1) Business Day of delivery of the
Redemption Notice, the Company shall give written notice (the " _Settlement
Method Notice_ ") to the Redeemed Member (with a copy to the Corporation) of
its intended settlement method; _provided_ that if the Company does not timely
deliver a Settlement Method Notice, the Company shall be deemed to have
elected the Share Settlement method. The Redeemed Member may retract
its Redemption Notice by giving written notice (the " _Retraction Notice_ ")
to the Company (with a copy to the Corporation) at any time prior to 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day after delivery of the
Settlement Method Notice. The timely delivery of a Retraction Notice shall
terminate all of the Redeemed Members, the Companys and the Corporation
rights and obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 11.01_ arising from
the retracted Redemption Notice.

 



42 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_,
in the event the Company elects a Share Settlement in connection with a
Redemption, a Redeemed Member shall be entitled, at any time prior to the
consummation of a Redemption, to revoke its Redemption Notice or delay the
consummation of a Redemption if any of the following conditions exists: (i)
any registration statement pursuant to which the resale of the Class A Common
Stock to be registered for such Redeemed Member at or immediately following
the consummation of the Redemption shall have ceased to be effective pursuant
to any action or inaction by the SEC or no such resale registration statement
has yet become effective; (ii) the Corporation shall have failed to cause any
related prospectus to be supplemented by any required prospectus supplement
necessary to effect such Redemption; (iii) the Corporation shall have
exercised a contractual right to defer, delay or suspend the filing or
effectiveness of a registration statement and such deferral, delay
or suspension shall affect the ability of such Redeemed Member to have the
resale of its Class A Common Stock registered at or immediately following the
consummation of the Redemption; (iv) the Corporation shall have disclosed to
such Redeemed Member any material non-public information concerning the
Corporation, the receipt of which results in such Redeemed Member being
prohibited or restricted from selling Class A Common Stock at or immediately
following the Redemption without disclosure of such information (and the
Corporation does not permit disclosure); (v) any stop order relating to the
registration statement pursuant to which the Class A Common Stock was to
be registered by such Redeemed Member at or immediately following the
Redemption shall have been issued by the SEC; (vi) there shall have occurred a
material disruption in the securities markets generally or in the market or
markets in which the Class A Common Stock is then traded; (vii) there shall
be in effect an injunction, a restraining order or a decree of any nature of
any Governmental Entity that restrains or prohibits the Redemption; (viii) the
Corporation shall have failed to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Stockholders Agreement, and such failure shall have
affected the ability of such Redeemed Member to consummate the resale of Class
A Common Stock to be received upon such redemption pursuant to an effective
registration statement; or (ix) the Redemption Date would occur three (3)
Business Days or less prior to, or during, a Black-Out Period; _provided
further_ , that in no event shall the Redeemed Member seeking to delay the
consummation of such Redemption and relying on any of the matters contemplated
in clauses (i) through (ix) above have controlled or intentionally materially
influenced any facts, circumstances, or Persons in connection therewith
(except in the good faith performance of his or her duties as an officer or
director of the Corporation) in order to provide such Redeemed Member with a
basis for such delay or revocation. If a Redeemed Member delays the
consummation of a Redemption pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, (A)
the Redemption Date shall occur on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
date on which the conditions giving rise to such delay cease to exist (or
such earlier day as the Corporation, the Company and such Redeemed Member may
agree in writing) and (B) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_, the Redeemed Member may retract its Redemption
Notice by giving a Retraction Notice to the Company (with a copy to the
Corporation) at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second
Business Day following the date on which the conditions giving rise to
such delay cease to exist.

 



43 (d) The amount of the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement that a Redeemed
Member is entitled to receive under _ 
Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ shall not be adjusted on account of any Distributions
previously made with respect to the Redeemed Units or dividends previously
paid with respect to Class A Common Stock;  _provided, however_ , that if a
Redeemed Member causes the Company to redeem Redeemed Units and the Redemption
Date occurs subsequent to the record date for any Distribution with respect to
the Redeemed Units but prior to payment of such Distribution, the Redeemed
Member shall be entitled to receive such Distribution with respect to the
Redeemed Units on the date that it is made notwithstanding that the Redeemed
Member transferred and surrendered the Redeemed Units to the Company prior to
such date.

(e) In the event of a distribution (by dividend or otherwise) by the
Corporation to all holders of Class A Common Stock of evidences of its
indebtedness, securities, or other assets (including Equity Securities of the
Corporation), but excluding any cash dividend or distribution of any such
assets received by the Corporation in respect of its Units, then, in exchange
for its Redeemed Units, a Redeemed Member shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to the consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_, the
amount of such security, securities or other property that the
Redeemed Member would have received if such Redemption Right had been
exercised and the Redemption Date had occurred immediately prior to the record
date or effective time of any such transaction, taking into account any
adjustment as a result of any subdivision (by any split, distribution or
dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after
such record date or effective time. For the avoidance of doubt, subsequent to
any such transaction, this _Article XI_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ with
respect to any such security, securities or other property received by
holders of Class A Common Stock in such transaction.

(f) If a Reclassification Event occurs, the Manager or its successor, as
the case may be, shall, as and to the extent necessary, amend this Agreement
in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 16.03_, and enter into any necessary
supplementary or additional agreements, to ensure that, following the
effective date of the Reclassification Event: (i) the rights of holders of
Common Units (other than the Corporation) set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.01_ provide that each Common Unit is redeemable for the same amount and
same type of property, securities or cash (or combination thereof) that one
share of Class A Common Stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a
result of the Reclassification Event (taking into account any adjustment as a
result of any subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after
the record date or effective time for such Reclassification Event) and (ii)
the Corporation or the successor to the Corporation, as applicable, is
obligated to deliver such property, securities or cash upon such redemption.
The Corporation shall not consummate or agree to consummate any
Reclassification Event unless the successor Person, if any, becomes obligated
to comply with the obligations of the Corporation (in whatever capacity) under
this Agreement.

 

Section 11.02 _Contribution of the Corporation_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
11.03_, in connection with the exercise of a Redeemed Members Redemption
Rights under _Section_ __ _ 11.01(a)_, the Corporation shall contribute to
the Company the consideration the Redeemed Member is entitled to receive
under  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_. Unless the Redeemed Member has timely
delivered a Retraction Notice as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.01(b)_ or has
delayed a Redemption as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 11.01(c)_, or the
Corporation has elected to effect a Direct Exchange as provided in _Section_
__ _ 11.03_, on the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the
close of business on the Redemption Date) (i) the Corporation shall make its
Capital Contribution to the Company (in the form of the Share Settlement or
the Cash Settlement) required under this _Section_ __ _ 11.02_, and (ii) the
Company shall issue to the Corporation a number of Common Units equal to the
number of Redeemed Units surrendered by the Redeemed Member. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the
Company elects a Cash Settlement, the Corporation shall only be obligated to
contribute to the Company an amount in respect of such Cash Settlement equal
to the net proceeds (after deduction of any underwriters discounts or
commissions and brokers fees or commissions) from the sale by the
Corporation of a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the number
of Redeemed Units to be redeemed with such Cash Settlement; _provided_ that
(x) the Corporations Capital Account shall be increased by an amount equal
to any such discounts, commissions and fees relating to such sale of shares of
Class A Common Stock in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ and (y) for the
avoidance of doubt, if the Cash Settlement to which the Redeemed Member is
entitled exceeds the amount that is contributed to the Company by the
Corporation, the Company shall still be required to pay the Redeemed Member
the full amount of the Cash Settlement.

 



44 Section 11.03 _Exchange Right of the Corporation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XI_ , the
Corporation may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to effect on the
Redemption Date the exchange of Redeemed Units for the Share Settlement or
Cash Settlement, at the Corporations option, through a direct exchange of
such Redeemed Units and such consideration between the Redeemed Member and
the Corporation (a " _Direct Exchange_ "). Upon such Direct Exchange pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, the Corporation shall acquire the Redeemed
Units and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of
such Units.

(b) The Corporation may, at any time prior to a Redemption Date, deliver
written notice (an " _Exchange Election Notice_ ") to the Company and the
Redeemed Member setting forth its election to exercise its right to consummate
a Direct Exchange; _provided_ that such election does not prejudice the
ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption or Direct Exchange on the
Redemption Date. An Exchange Election Notice may be revoked by the Corporation
at any time; _provided_ that any such revocation does not prejudice the
ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption on the Redemption Date. The
right to consummate a Direct Exchange in all events shall be exercisable for
all the Redeemed Units that would have otherwise been subject to a Redemption.
Except as otherwise provided by this  _Section_ __ _ 11.03_, a Direct
Exchange shall be consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same
manner as the relevant Redemption would have been consummated if the
Corporation had not delivered an Exchange Election Notice.

Section 11.04 _Reservation of Shares of Class_ __ _ A Common Stock; Listing;
Certificate of the Corporation_. At all times the Corporation shall reserve
and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock,
solely for the purpose of issuance upon a Redemption or Direct Exchange, such
number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall be issuable upon any such
Redemption or Direct Exchange pursuant to Share Settlements; _provided_ that
nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the Corporation from
satisfying its obligations in respect of any such Redemption or Direct
Exchange by delivery of purchased Class A Common Stock (which may or may not
be held in the treasury of the Corporation) or the delivery of cash pursuant
to a Cash Settlement. The Corporation shall deliver Class A Common Stock that
has been registered under the Securities Act with respect to any Redemption or
Direct Exchange to the extent a registration statement is effective and
available for such shares. The Corporation shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to list the Class A Common Stock required to be delivered
upon any such Redemption or Direct Exchange prior to such delivery upon each
national securities exchange upon which the outstanding shares of Class A
Common Stock are listed at the time of such Redemption or Direct Exchange (it
being understood that any such shares may be subject to transfer restrictions
under applicable securities Laws). The Corporation covenants that all Class A
Common Stock issued upon a Redemption or Direct Exchange will, upon issuance,
be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The provisions of this
_Article XI_ shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with the
corresponding provisions of the Corporations certificate of incorporation.

 



45 Section 11.05 _Effect of Exercise of Redemption or Exchange Right_. This
Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the consummation of a Redemption or
Direct Exchange and all governance or other rights set forth herein shall be
exercised by the remaining Members and the Redeemed Member (to the extent of
such Redeemed Members remaining interest in the Company). No Redemption or
Direct Exchange shall relieve such Redeemed Member of any prior breach of this
Agreement.

 

Section 11.06 _Tax Treatment_. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a Redemption or a Direct
Exchange, as the case may be, shall be treated as a direct exchange between
the Corporation and the Redeemed Member for U.S. federal (and applicable state
and local) income tax purposes. The issuance of shares of Class A Common
Stock or other securities upon a Redemption or Direct Exchange shall be made
without charge to the Redeemed Member for any stamp or other similar tax in
respect of such issuance.

 

ARTICLE XII

ADMISSION OF MEMBERS 

Section 12.01 _Substituted Members_. Subject to the provisions of _Article X_
, in connection with the Permitted Transfer of a Company Interest hereunder
or a Transfer consented to by the Conflicts Committee, the transferee shall
become a substituted Member (" _Substituted Member_ ") on the effective date
of such Transfer, which effective date shall not be earlier than the date of
compliance with the conditions to such Transfer, and such admission shall be
shown on the Schedule of Members.

 

Section 12.02 _Additional Members_. Subject to the provisions of _Article III_
and _Article X_ , any Person that is not an Original Member or the
Corporation may be admitted to the Company as an additional Member (any such
Person, an " _Additional Member_ ") only upon furnishing to the Manager (a) a
Joinder (or other counterpart to this Agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Manager) and counterparts of any applicable Other Agreements and (b) such
other documents or instruments as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to effect such Persons admission as a Member (including entering into such
documents as the Manager may deem appropriate in its reasonable discretion).
Such admission shall become effective on the date on which the Manager
determines in its reasonable discretion that such conditions have
been satisfied and when any such admission is shown on the books and records
of the Company.

 



46 ARTICLE XIII

 

WITHDRAWAL AND RESIGNATION; TERMINATION OF RIGHTS

 

Section 13.01 _Withdrawal and Resignation of Members_. No Member shall have
the power or right to withdraw or otherwise resign as a Member from the
Company prior to the termination of the Company pursuant to _Article XIV_.
Upon a Transfer of all of a Members Units in a Transfer permitted by this
Agreement, subject to the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 10.06_, such Member
shall cease to be a Member.

ARTICLE XIV

 

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

 

Section 14.01 _Dissolution_. The Company shall not be dissolved by the
admission of Additional Members or Substituted Members or the attempted
withdrawal or resignation of a Member. The Company shall dissolve, and its
affairs shall be wound up, upon:

(a) the decision of the Manager (pursuant to a unanimous decision of the
Corporate Board) together with the Requisite Members to dissolve the Company;

(b) a dissolution of the Company under Section 18-801(a)(4) of the Delaware
Act; or

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under
Section 18-802 of the Delaware Act.

The bankruptcy (within the meaning of Section 18-304 of the Delaware Act) of
a Member shall not cause the Member to cease to be a member of the Company. An
Event of Withdrawal shall not, in and of itself, cause a dissolution of the
Company and the Company shall continue without dissolution subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 14.02 _Liquidation and Termination_. On dissolution of the Company,
the Manager shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more Persons as
liquidator. The liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of
the Company and make final distributions as provided herein and in the
Delaware Act. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Company
expense. Until final distribution, the liquidators shall continue to operate
the Company properties with all of the power and authority of the Manager. The
steps to be accomplished by the liquidators are as follows:

 

(a) as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final
liquidation, the liquidators shall cause a proper accounting to be made by a
recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Companys assets,
liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which
the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;

 



47 (b) the liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from Company funds, or
otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof
(including the establishment of a cash fund for contingent, conditional or
unmatured liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidators may
reasonably determine) all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the
Company (including all expenses incurred in liquidation); and

(c) all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members
in accordance with _Article IV_ by the end of the Taxable Year during which
the liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, by ninety (90) days after
the date of the liquidation). The distribution of cash and/or property to the
Members in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 14.02_ and
_Section_ __ _ 14.03_ below constitutes a complete return to the Members of
their Capital Contributions, a complete distribution to the Members of their
interest in the Company and all the Companys property and constitutes a
compromise to which all Members have consented within the meaning of the
Delaware Act. To the extent that a Member returns funds to the Company, it
has no claim against any other Member for those funds.

Section 14.03 _Deferment; Distribution in Kind_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 14.02_, but subject to the order of priorities
set forth therein, if upon dissolution of the Company the liquidators
determine that an immediate sale of part or all of the Companys assets would
be impractical or would cause undue loss (or would otherwise not be
beneficial) to the Members, the liquidators may, in their sole discretion,
defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except
those necessary to satisfy Company liabilities (other than loans to the
Company by Members) and reserves. Subject to the order of priorities set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 14.02_, the liquidators may, in their sole discretion,
distribute to the Members, in lieu of cash, either (a) all or any portion of
such remaining Company assets in-kind in accordance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 14.02(c)_, (b) as tenants in common and in accordance with
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 14.02(c)_, undivided interests in all or any
portion of such Company assets or (c) a combination of the foregoing. Any such
Distributions in kind shall be subject to (x) such conditions relating to the
disposition and management of such assets as the liquidators deem reasonable
and equitable and (y) the terms and conditions of any agreements governing
such assets (or the operation thereof or the holders thereof) at such time.
Any Company assets distributed in kind will first be written up or down to
their Fair Market Value, thus creating Profit or Loss (if any), which shall be
allocated in accordance with _Article V_. The liquidators shall determine the
Fair Market Value of any property distributed in accordance with the valuation
procedures set forth in _Article XV_.

 

Section 14.04 _Cancellation of Certificate_. On completion of the winding up
of Company assets as provided herein and the Delaware Act, the Company is
terminated (and the Company shall not be terminated prior to such time), and
the Manager (or such other Person or Persons as the Delaware Act may require
or permit) shall file a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary
of State of Delaware, cancel any other filings made pursuant to this
Agreement that are or should be canceled and take such other actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Company. The Company shall be deemed to continue in
existence for all purposes of this Agreement until it is terminated pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 14.04_.

 



48 Section 14.05 _Reasonable Time for Winding Up_. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company
and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to _Sections 14.02_ and _14.03_ in
order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

 

Section 14.06 _Return of Capital_. The liquidators shall not be personally
liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any portion thereof to the
Members (it being understood that any such return shall be made solely from
Company assets).

ARTICLE XV

 

VALUATION

Section 15.01  _Determination_. " _Fair Market Value_ " of a specific Company
asset will mean the amount which the Company would receive in an all-cash sale
of such asset in an arms-length transaction with a willing unaffiliated third
party, with neither party having any compulsion to buy or sell, consummated on
the day immediately preceding the date on which the event occurred which
necessitated the determination of the Fair Market Value (and after giving
effect to any transfer taxes payable in connection with such sale), as such
amount is determined by the Manager (or, if pursuant to _Section_ __ _
14.02_, the liquidators) in its good faith judgment using all factors,
information and data it deems to be pertinent.

Section 15.02 _Dispute Resolution_. If any Member or Members dispute the
accuracy of any determination of Fair Market Value in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 15.01_, and the Manager and such Member(s) are unable to agree
on the determination of the Fair Market Value of any asset of the Company,
the Manager and such Member(s) shall each select a nationally recognized
investment banking firm experienced in valuing securities of closely-held
companies such as the Company in the Companys industry (the " _Appraisers_
"), who shall each determine the Fair Market Value of the asset or the Company
(as applicable) in accordance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 15.01_.
The Appraisers shall be instructed to give written notice of their
determination of the Fair Market Value of the asset or the Company (as
applicable) within thirty (30) days of their appointment as Appraisers. If
Fair Market Value as determined by an Appraiser is higher than the Fair
Market Value as determined by the other Appraiser by 10% or more, and the
Manager and such Member(s) do not otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value, the
original Appraisers shall designate a third Appraiser meeting the same
criteria used to select the original two, and the Fair Market Value shall be
the average of the Fair Market Values determined by all three Appraisers,
unless the Manager and such Member(s) otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value.
If Fair Market Value as determined by an Appraiser is within 10% of the Fair
Market Value as determined by the other Appraiser (but not identical), and the
Manager and such Member(s) do not otherwise agree on a Fair Market Value, the
Manager shall select the Fair Market Value of one of the Appraisers. The fees
and expenses of the Appraisers shall be borne by the Company.

ARTICLE XVI

representatives.

Section 16.02  _Confidentiality_. Except as required by applicable Law, the

include information or material that: (a) is rightfully in the possession of
the Manager or such Member at the time of disclosure by the Company; (b)
before or after it has been disclosed to the Manager or each Member by the
Company, becomes part of public knowledge, not as a result of any action or

or such Member or their respective representatives without use or reference to
the Confidential Information.

 



50 Section 16.03 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or modified in

prejudicial manner, (d) that materially alters or changes any rights,

Section 16.06 _Binding Effect; Intended Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and, to the
extent permitted by this Agreement, their heirs, executors, administrators,
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.

 

Section 16.07 _Creditors_. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be
for the benefit of or enforceable by any creditors of the Company or any of
its Affiliates, and no creditor who makes a loan to the Company or any of its
Affiliates may have or acquire (except pursuant to the terms of a separate
agreement executed by the Company in favor of such creditor) at any time as a
result of making the loan any direct or indirect interest in Company Profits,
Losses, Distributions, capital or property other than as a secured creditor.

 

Section 16.08 _Waiver_. No failure by any party to insist upon the strict
performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement
or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof shall
constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement
or condition, regardless of how long such failure continues.

 

Section 16.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each of which will be an original and all of which together
shall constitute one and the same agreement binding on all the parties hereto.

Section 16.10 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Any dispute relating hereto shall be heard in the state or federal
courts of the State of Delaware, and the parties agree to jurisdiction and
venue therein.

Section 16.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or
rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
will not affect any other provision or the effectiveness or validity of any
provision in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed,
construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

Section 16.12 _Further Action_. The parties shall execute and deliver all
documents, provide all information and take or refrain from taking such
actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes
of this Agreement.

 



53 Section 16.13 _Conflict_. In the event of a direct conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and (i) any provision of the Certificate or (ii)
any mandatory, non-waivable provision of the Delaware Act, such provision of
the Certificate or the Delaware Act shall control. If any provision of the
Delaware Act provides that it may be varied or superseded in the agreement of
a limited liability company (or otherwise by agreement of the members or
managers of a limited liability company), such provision shall be
deemed superseded and waived in its entirety if this Agreement contains a
provision addressing the same issue or subject matter.

 

Section 16.14 _Delivery by Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement and any
signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement
or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of an electronic transmission, including by a
facsimile machine or via email, shall be treated in all manner and respects
as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the
same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of electronic
transmission by a facsimile machine or via email to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through such electronic transmission as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

Section 16.15 _Right of Offset_. Whenever the Company is to pay any sum
(other than pursuant to _Article IV_ ) to any Member, any amounts that such
Member owes to the Company which are not the subject of a good faith dispute
may be deducted from that sum before payment. For the avoidance of doubt,
the distribution of Units to the Corporation shall not be subject to this
_Section_ __ _ 16.15_.

Section 16.16  _Effectiveness_. This Agreement shall be effective immediately
upon the Business Combination Closing (the " _Effective Time_ "). The Second
AandR LLC Agreement shall govern the rights and obligations of the Company and
the other parties to this Agreement in their capacity as Members prior to the
Effective Time.

Section 16.17 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and those documents
expressly referred to herein (including the Stockholders Agreement and the
Business Combination Agreement) embody the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties and supersede and preempt any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the parties, written or oral, which
may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Second AandR LLC Agreement is superseded in its entirety by this
Agreement as of the Effective Time and shall be of no further force and effect
thereafter.

Section 16.18 _Remedies_. Each Member shall have all rights and remedies set
forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies which such Person has been
granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the
rights which such Person has under any Law. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any Person having any rights under any provision of this
Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby shall be entitled to
enforce such rights specifically (without posting a bond or other security),
to recover damages by reason of any breach of any provision of this Agreement
and to exercise all other rights granted by Law.

 



54 Section 16.19 _Descriptive Headings; Interpretation_. The descriptive headings
of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a
substantive part of this Agreement. Whenever required by the context, any
pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns and verbs
shall include the plural and vice versa. The use of the word "including" in
this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than by limitation. Reference
to any agreement, document or instrument means such agreement, document or
instrument as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no amendment or other
modification to any agreement, document or instrument that requires the
consent of any Person pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other
agreement will be given effect hereunder unless such Person has consented in
writing to such amendment or modification. Wherever required by the context,
references to a Fiscal Year shall refer to a portion thereof. The use of the
words "or," "either" and "any" shall not be exclusive. The parties hereto
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
Wherever a conflict exists between this Agreement and any other agreement,
this Agreement shall control but solely to the extent of such conflict.

ARTICLE III

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS

3.1 _Board Composition_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 3.1(c)_, until the Trigger Date, the Company Board
shall consist of no more than eleven (11) directors. Immediately following
the Closing, the Company Board shall be comprised of (i) six (6) directors
designated by the Amneal Group Representative prior to the Closing
(collectively, with any of their successors designated in accordance with 
_Section 3.2(a)_ and _Section 3.2(b)_ hereof and any additional director
designated by the Amneal Group Representative pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_,
the " _Amneal Directors_ ") and (ii) five (5) directors designated by Impax

7  of Impax immediately prior to the Closing (the " _CEO Director_ ") and (B)

of directors as of the date of the Transaction Agreement and including the
chairman thereof) (collectively with the CEO Director, the " _Initial Company
Directors_ " and together with their successors and any additional directors
appointed or designated in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ and _Section
3.2(e)_ hereof, the " _Non-Amneal Directors_ ").

 

(b) Immediately following the Closing, and for so long as Amneal Group has
beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock, (i) the Non-Amneal Directors shall have
the right to designate the lead Independent Director of the Company Board, and
(ii) the Amneal Directors shall have the right to designate the Co-Chairmen
of the Company Board. Immediately following the Closing, the Co-Chairmen of

the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to a Person or a group of
Persons pursuant to a PIPE Transaction (such a Person or group of Persons, a "
_Qualifying Investor_ ") and, following such Transfer, Amneal Group continues
to beneficially own more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares
of the Company Common Stock, Amneal Group shall have a one-time right
exercisable within one year following such transaction (the " _Board Expansion
Right_ ") to cause the Company to increase the size of the Company Board by
two (2) directors and to fill the resulting vacancies with one new director
designated by the Amneal Group Representative and one new director designated

with the right to appoint a director to the Company Board for so long as such
Qualifying Investor continues to beneficially own more than four percent (4%)
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Ownership
Threshold_ "). In addition to the foregoing, any Qualifying Investor may, for
so long as it satisfies the Ownership Threshold and has not appointed a

the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to a Qualifying Investor, and,
immediately prior to or following such Transfer, Amneal Group beneficially
owns less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock (whether or not the Board Expansion Right pursuant to  _Section
3.1(c)_ has been exercised prior to such time), the Amneal Group
Representative shall have a one-time right in connection with such transaction
to cause the Company to replace any Exiting Amneal Director with a director
designated by such Qualifying Investor. For purposes of this _Section
3.1(d)_, an " _Exiting Amneal Director_ " shall mean an Amneal Director that
the Amneal Group Representative is no longer entitled to designate pursuant
to  _Section 3.1(a)_ as a result of such Transfer. To the extent requested
by such Qualifying Investor, this Agreement shall be amended to provide such
Qualifying Investor with the right to appoint a director to the Company Board
for so long as such Qualifying Investor continues to beneficially own more
than five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

 



8 3.2 _Director Nomination Rights_.

 

(a) Until the Trigger Date and subject to _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_, in connection

consents having the same effect, the Nominating Committee shall nominate for
election to the Company Board person(s) designated for nomination by
the Amneal Group Representative (each person so designated, an " _Amneal
Designee_ ") in accordance with the following:

 

(i) if Amneal Group has beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%)
of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock, the Amneal Group
Representative shall have the right to designate the lowest number of Amneal
Designees that constitutes a majority of the total number of directors
comprising the Company Board; and

 

(ii) if Amneal Group has beneficial ownership of ten percent (10%) or more,
but fifty percent (50%) or less, of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, the Amneal Group Representative shall have the right to
designate a number of directors equal to the product of (x) the percentage of
the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Amneal Group and (y)
the total number of directors comprising the Company Board, rounded up to the
nearest whole number (e.g., one and one quarter (1 1/4) directors shall be
rounded up to two (2) directors); _provided_ , that such rounding shall not
result in the Amneal Group Representative having the right to designate a
majority of the total number of directors comprising the Company Board when
Amneal Group beneficially owns 50% or less of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock.

 

(b) Until the Trigger Date, the Amneal Group Representative shall have full
authority and ability to designate any Amneal Designees, and the Company
Board shall approve the nomination of any Amneal Designee. Subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, the Amneal Group Representative shall have the
exclusive right to remove any Amneal Directors from the Company Board. In the
event any Amneal Designee is intended to qualify as an Independent Director
on the Company Board, the Amneal Group Representative shall consult in good
faith with the Company Board and solicit its input prior to making such
designation. The Amneal Group Representative shall not designate any person
to be an Amneal Designee (nor shall any Qualifying Investor be entitled to
designate any person to be a director) who is unqualified under any applicable
Law to serve as a director on the Company Board. For the avoidance of doubt,
current or former employment of any Amneal Designee with an Amneal Group
Member or any of its Subsidiaries or service by any such Amneal Designee on
the board of directors of an Amneal Group Member or any of its Subsidiaries
shall not, by itself, disqualify such individual from serving on the Company
Board as an Amneal Designee.

 



9 (c) Subject to _Section 3.1(d)_ and _Section 4.1(d)(ii) and (iii)_, if at
any time the number of Amneal Directors then serving on the Company Board is

has the right to designate pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section
3.2(a)_, upon receipt of the written request of the Conflicts Committee, the
Amneal Group Representative shall, and the Amneal Group shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause a number of Amneal Directors equal to the excess
to promptly tender his, her or their resignations from the Company Board (and
from any committees or subcommittees thereof to which any such Amneal Director
is then appointed or on which he or she is then serving) within sixty (60)
days of such request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, if within such sixty
(60) day period Amneal Group has regained its right to designate any such
Amneal Director pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, then such Amneal Director shall
continue serving on the Company Board. Subject to _Section 3.1(d)_, in the
event that an Amneal Director shall cease to serve as a director pursuant to
this _Section 3.2(c)_, the Nominating Committee shall have the sole right to
fill such vacancy or designate a person for nomination for election to the
Company Board to fill such vacancy with a person who shall satisfy all the
qualifications of a Company Independent Director, in each case. If at any time
the number of Amneal Directors then serving on the Company Board is less than
the number of Amneal Designees Amneal Group has the right to designate
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ or _Section 3.2(a)_, the Company Board and the
Nominating Committee shall, at the request of the Amneal Group
Representative, take all actions reasonably necessary to cause a number of
Amneal Designees equal to such deficit to be appointed to the Company Board
within sixty (60) days of such request.

 

(d) Until the Trigger Date, in the event that any Amneal Director shall cease
to serve as a director for any reason other than pursuant to  _Section
3.2(c)_, the vacancy resulting therefrom shall be filled by the Company Board
as promptly as reasonably practicable with a substitute Amneal Director
selected by Amneal Group in accordance with the requirements for the
designation of Amneal Designees pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)_.

(e) From and after the Closing, in the event of a vacancy on the Company
Board upon the death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from
office or other cause of any Non-Amneal Director (other than the CEO
Director), the Nominating Committee shall have the sole right to fill such
vacancy or designate a person for nomination for election to the Company
Board to fill such vacancy, subject to the prior written consent of the
Conflicts Committee, and such person shall satisfy all the qualifications of a
Company Independent Director. The Nominating Committee shall take all actions
necessary to cause the vacancy upon the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal from office or other cause of the CEO Director to be
filled by the successor Chief Executive Officer of the Company or
to designate such person for nomination for election to the Company Board to
fill such vacancy.

(f) The Nominating Committee shall nominate such number of Amneal Designees
and such number of nominees to serve as Non-Amneal Directors as required to
comply with the requirements of _Section 3.1_ hereof and this _Section 3.2_.

held by Other Stockholders approve the transaction (or equivalent tender offer
condition).

 



17 4.2 _Related Party Transactions_.

 

(a) All proposed Related Party Transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents between the Company and any Amneal Group Member have been approved
by the Company Board in connection with its approval of this Agreement. Any
material amendments to or material modifications or terminations of or
material waivers, consents or elections under any Related Party Transactions

4.3 _Participation Rights_.

 

(a) To the extent permitted under NYSE rules, the Company hereby grants to
Amneal Group the right to purchase the Pro Rata Portion of any Company
Securities (other than any Excluded Securities) that the Company may from time
to time propose to issue or sell to any Person, which right shall be
exercisable by the Amneal Group Representative on behalf of Amneal Group. For
purposes of this _Section 4.3_, " _Excluded Securities_ " means Company
Securities issued in connection with: (i) a grant to any existing or
prospective consultants, employees, officers or directors pursuant to any
stock option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, performance

or (v) any issuance of warrants or other similar rights to purchase Company

transaction providing debt financing to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent stockholder

 



18  approval is required under the NYSE rules for the issuance or sale of
Company Securities as provided in this _Section 4.3_, (x) the Company may
issue or sell Company Securities to such other Persons prior to obtaining
such stockholder approval in accordance with _Section 4.3(d)_ (to the extent
no stockholder approval is required for the issuance or sale of Company
Securities to such other Persons), and (y) the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain such approval, and after receipt of such
approval the Company shall issue or sell the Company Securities (if any) that
any Amneal Group Member has irrevocably elected to purchase to such
Amneal Group Member, on the terms set forth in the relevant Issuance Notice.

(b) The Company shall give written notice (an " _Issuance Notice_ ") of any
proposed issuance or sale described in _Section 4.3(a)_ to Amneal Group
within five (5) Business Days following any meeting of the Company Board at
which any such issuance or sale is approved or, if the approval of the
Company Board is not required in connection with such issuance or sale, no
less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the proposed issuance or
sale. The Issuance Notice shall, if applicable, be accompanied by a written
offer from any prospective purchaser seeking to purchase Company Securities
and shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the proposed
issuance, including:

 

(i) the number and class of the Company Securities to be issued and the
percentage of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company such
issuance would represent;

(ii) the proposed issuance date, which shall be at least ten (10) Business
Days from the date of the Issuance Notice; and

receipt of an Issuance Notice have the right to elect irrevocably to purchase
the Pro Rata Portion of the Company Securities at the purchase price set forth
in the Issuance Notice by delivering a written notice to the Company, which
right shall be exercisable on behalf of Amneal Group by the Amneal Group
Representative. If, at the termination of such ten (10) Business Day period,
the Amneal Group Representative shall have failed to deliver such notice to
the Company, Amneal Group shall be deemed to have waived all of its rights
under this  _Section 4.3_ with respect to the purchase of such Company
Securities. The closing of any purchase by the Amneal Group Representative
shall be consummated concurrently with the consummation of the issuance or
sale described in the Issuance Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
closing of any purchase by the Amneal Group Representative may be extended
beyond the closing of the transaction in the Issuance Notice to the extent
necessary to obtain any required approval or consent of a Governmental Entity
or any other third party (and the Company and Amneal Group shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals).

 

(d) Upon the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period described in
_Section 4.3(c)_, the Company shall be free to sell such Company Securities
that the Amneal Group Representative has not elected irrevocably to purchase
on terms and conditions no more favorable to the purchasers thereof than those
offered to Amneal Group in the Issuance Notice delivered in accordance with
_Section 4.3(b)_.

 



19 ARTICLE V

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

5.1  _Shelf Registration Statement_. Prior to the Closing, the Amneal Group
Representative and Impax shall jointly prepare, and Impax shall cause the
Company to file with the SEC (no later than five (5) Business Days following
the later of (i) the date on which the Registration Statement on Form S-4, to
be jointly prepared by Amneal and Impax and filed by the Company in accordance
with Section 6.01 of the Transaction Agreement (the " _Form S-4
Registration Statement_ "), is declared effective by the SEC and (ii) the
date that Impax has received all information reasonably required from Amneal
Group for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement, to the extent such
information was not previously included in the Form S-4 Registration
Statement) a "shelf" registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC with
respect to resales of all Registrable Shares to be held by Amneal
Group following the Closing in accordance with Rule 415 (together with any
additional registration statements filed to register any Registrable Shares,
the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "). Prior to the Closing, Impax shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company to, and following the
Closing the Company shall, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed pursuant to this _Section 5.1_
to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
possible after filing with the SEC and (ii) maintain the effectiveness of (and
availability for use of) such Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-1
(including by, without limitation, filing any post-effective amendments
thereto or prospectus supplements in respect thereof) until a Shelf
Registration Statement on Form S-3 has been declared effective pursuant to the
below. Upon becoming eligible to use Form S-3, the Company shall promptly file
a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3, which may be in the form of a
post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-1,
covering all of the then Registrable Shares and will maintain the
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or such
comparable or successor form) then in effect until such time as there are no
Registrable Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
5.1_, if the SEC prevents the Company from including on a registration
statement any or all of the Registrable Shares to be registered pursuant to
this _Section 5.1_ due to limitations on the use of Rule 415 of the
Securities Act for the resale of Registrable Shares by Amneal Group (a "
_Rule 415 Limitation_"), such registration statement shall register the
resale of a number of Registrable Shares which is equal to the maximum number
of shares as is permitted by the SEC, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to register all such remaining Registrable Shares for
resale as promptly as reasonably practicable in accordance with the applicable
rules, regulations and guidance of the SEC. In such event, the number of
Registrable Shares to be registered for each Amneal Group Member in such
registration statement shall be reduced pro rata (i) first, among all Amneal
Group Members and (ii) second, among purchasers of Company Common Stock in
any Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction, in each case based on the proportion
that the number of Registrable Shares held by such Amneal Group Member or
shares held by such purchasers pursuant to such registration statement bears
to the total number of Registrable Shares or shares held by such purchasers,
as applicable, to be registered pursuant to such registration statement.

 



20 5.2 _Blackout Periods_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.1_ to the
contrary, the Company shall be entitled to postpone and delay the filing or
effectiveness (but not the preparation) of any registration statement or the
offer or sale of any Registrable Shares thereunder (i) for reasonable periods
of time in advance of the release of the Companys quarterly and annual
financial results and (ii) for reasonable periods of time, not in excess of an
aggregate of sixty (60) calendar days in any twelve (12)-month period and in
no event more than two times in any twelve (12)-month period (any such
postponement and delay permitted by this _Section 5.2_ being, a " _Blackout
Period_ "), if (A) the Conflicts Committee determines in its good faith
judgment that any such filing or effectiveness of a registration statement or
the offering or sale of any Registrable Shares thereunder would (1) materially
impede, materially delay or otherwise materially interfere with any pending or
proposed material acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other
similar material transaction involving the Company as to which the Company has
taken substantial steps and is proceeding with reasonable diligence to effect,
(2) materially adversely affect any registered underwritten public offering
of the Companys securities for the Companys account as to which the Company
has taken substantial steps (including, but not limited to, selecting a
managing underwriter for such offering) and is proceeding with reasonable
diligence to effect such offering, or (3) require disclosure of material non-
public information which, in the reasonable discretion of the Board, acting in
good faith, would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations
or management of the Company or any of its Affiliates if disclosed at such
time or (B) the Conflicts Committee determines in its good faith judgment that
it is necessary to amend or supplement the affected registration statement or
the related prospectus so that such registration statement or prospectus shall
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall give
written notice to each Amneal Group Member that holds Registrable Shares of
its determination to postpone or delay the filing of such registration
statement or other imposition of a Blackout Period and a general statement of
the reason for such deferral and an approximation of the anticipated delay;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the event that the Company proposes to
register shares of Class A Common Stock (other than in connection with a
registered underwritten public offering of the Companys securities for the
Companys account) during a Blackout Period, the Company shall not pursuant to
this _Section 5.2_ be entitled to postpone or delay the filing or
effectiveness of any registration statement or the offer or sale of any
Registrable Shares during such Blackout Period. Upon notice by the Company to
Amneal Group of any such determination, each Amneal Group Member shall,
except as required by applicable Law, keep the fact of any such notice
strictly confidential, and during any Blackout Period, promptly halt any
offer, sale, trading or transfer by it of any shares of Class A Common
Stock pursuant to the registration statement for the duration of the Blackout
Period set forth in such notice (or until such Blackout Period shall be
earlier terminated in writing by the Company) and promptly halt any use,
publication, dissemination or distribution of any prospectus or prospectus
supplement covering such Registrable Shares for the duration of the Blackout
Period set forth in such notice (or until such Blackout Period shall be
earlier terminated in writing by the Company) and, if so directed by the
Company, shall deliver to the Company any copies then in its possession of any
such prospectus or prospectus supplement. A deferral of the filing or
effectiveness of a registration statement or other imposition of a
Blackout Period pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be lifted as soon as
practicable (and in no event later than the 46th calendar day in any 12-month
period), and the Company shall promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) notify each Amneal Group Member, upon the circumstances giving
rise to such Blackout Period no longer being present.

 



21 5.3 _Demand Underwritten Offerings_.

 

(a) In the period following the expiration of the Lockup Period during which a
Shelf Registration Statement covering the Registrable Shares is effective, if
any Amneal Group Member (the " _Participating Amneal Members_ ") delivers
notice to the Company (such notice to be delivered no less than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date the underwriting agreement for
any underwriting pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ is expected to be executed)
stating that it intends to effect an underwritten public offering of all or
part of its Registrable Shares included on the Shelf Registration Statement
(a " _Demand Underwritten Offering_ "), the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement or
related prospectus as may be necessary in order to enable such Registrable
Shares to be distributed pursuant to the underwritten offering. Amneal Group
shall only be entitled to offer and sell its Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Demand Underwritten Offering if the aggregate amount of Registrable Shares to
be offered and sold in such offering by the Participating Amneal Members are
reasonably expected to result in aggregate gross proceeds (based on the
current market price of the number of Registrable Shares to be sold) of not
less than $75 million.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, following the
Closing, (i) no Demand Underwritten Offering may be requested prior to the
expiration of the Lockup Period, (ii) the Company may delay the commencement
of any Demand Underwritten Offering for the same reasons as the Company may
institute a Blackout Period prior to the commencement of any marketing
efforts or "road shows" by the Company or the underwriters in connection with
such Demand Underwritten Offering, and (iii) Amneal Group, collectively, shall
have the right to request no more than an aggregate of two (2)
Demand Underwritten Offerings or Company-Assisted PIPE Transactions in any
twelve (12)-month period (other than the first Company-Assisted PIPE
Transaction in any such twelve (12)-month period). Any request for a Demand
Underwritten Offering under this  _Section 5.3_ may be revoked or withdrawn
upon written notice by the Participating Amneal Members to the Company;
_provided_ , that any such Demand Underwritten Offering withdrawn or not
consummated for any reason shall be counted toward the total of two (2)
Demand Underwritten Offerings or Company-Assisted PIPE Transactions permitted
to be requested in any twelve (12)-month period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no revoked or withdrawn Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-Assisted PIPE
Transaction shall be counted for determining the number of Demand Underwritten
Offerings or Company-Assisted PIPE Transactions requested in any twelve
(12)-month period if (1) Amneal Group reimburses the Company for all of its
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with any such revoked
or withdrawn Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction
incurred through the date of such revocation or withdrawal and (2) such
revocation or withdrawal shall have been made prior to the commencement of any
marketing efforts or "road shows" by the Company or the underwriters in
connection with such Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-Assisted
PIPE Transaction; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Participating Amneal
Members shall be entitled, at any time after receiving notice of the
imposition of any Blackout Period by the Company, to withdraw a request for a
Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction and, if
such request is withdrawn, such Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-
Assisted PIPE Transaction shall not count toward the total of two (2) Demand
Underwritten Offerings or Company-Assisted PIPE Transactions permitted to be
requested in any twelve (12)-month period.

 



22 (c) In connection with any Demand Underwritten Offering or Company-Assisted
PIPE Transaction, the managing underwriter or placement agent (if any) for
such offering shall be selected by the Participating Amneal Members, subject
to the prior approval of the Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

 __(d) The Company may include Company Common Stock other than Registrable
Shares in a Demand Underwritten Offering for any accounts on the terms
provided below. If the managing underwriter of any proposed Demand
Underwritten Offering informs the Company and the Participating Amneal Members
that, in its or their opinion, the number of Registrable Shares which such
Participating Amneal Members and any other Persons intend to include in such
offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without being
likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered or the market for the Registrable
Shares offered, then the Registrable Shares to be included in such
underwritten offering shall be (i) first, if requested by the Company on
behalf of TPG, the number of shares of Company Common Stock TPG proposes
to sell equal to at least the lesser of (A) 50% of the dollar value of the
shares of Company Common Stock to be sold in the Demand Underwritten Offering
or (B) $150,000,000 of shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) second, and only
if all the shares referred to in clause (i) have been included, the number of
shares of Registrable Shares that the Participating Amneal Members propose to
sell, with such number to be allocated _pro rata_ ( _provided_ , that any
securities thereby allocated to a Participating Amneal Member that exceed
such a Participating Amneal Members request shall be reallocated among the
remaining requesting a Participating Amneal Members in like manner) and (iii)
third, and only if all the shares referred to in clause (ii) have been
included, the number of shares of Company Common Stock proposed to be included
therein by any other Persons (including Company Common Stock to be sold for
the account of the Company) allocated among such Persons in such manner as
the Company may determine. __

(e) Amneal Group may request in writing that the Company provide assistance
in connection with any PIPE Transaction proposed by Amneal Group (a "
_Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction_ "). Subject to the limitations on the
number of Company-Assisted PIPE Transactions in _Section 5.3(b)_,
the Company shall cause its management to support the marketing of the
Company Securities included in the Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction and make
themselves reasonably available for assistance in the selling effort for such
Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction, including, but not limited to, the
participation of such members of the Companys management in road show
presentations and the execution of customary stock purchase agreements,
engagement letters or ancillary documentation in connection therewith and
making customary representations and warranties and covenants and delivering
or causing the delivery thereunder of customary deliveries for the subject
company in such transaction.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Article V_ shall affect, supersede or otherwise modify
any of the restrictions on Transfer set forth in _Article IV_ or any other
provision of this Agreement.

 



23 5.4 _Piggyback Registration_.

 

(a) Whenever the Company proposes to publicly sell or register for sale any of
its securities in an underwritten offering pursuant to a registration
statement (a " _Piggyback Registration Statement_ ") under the Securities Act
(other than a registration statement on Form S-8 or on Form S-4 or any similar
successor forms thereto) (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), the Company shall
give prompt written notice to Amneal Group of its intention to effect such
sale or registration (the " _Piggyback Registration Notice_ ") and, subject to
_Section 5.4(b)_, shall include in such transaction all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received a written request
from any Amneal Group Member for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days
after the receipt of the Companys notice. The Company may postpone or
withdraw the filing or the effectiveness of a Piggyback Registration at any
time in its sole discretion, without prejudice to any Amneal Group Members
right to immediately request a Demand Underwritten Offering hereunder.

__(b) If the managing underwriter or underwriters of any proposed underwritten
offering of Registrable Shares included in a Piggyback Registration informs
the Company and the Amneal Group Members that have requested to participate in
such offering that, in its or their opinion, the number of Registrable Shares
which such Amneal Group Members and any other Persons intend to include in
such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing or
distribution of the securities offered or the market for the
Registrable Shares offered, then the Registrable Shares to be included in
such underwritten offering shall be (i) first, if requested by the Company on
behalf of TPG, the number of shares of Company Common Stock TPG proposes to
sell equal to at least the lesser of (A) 50% of the dollar value of the
shares of Company Common Stock to be sold in the Demand Underwritten Offering
or $150,000,000 of shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) second, and only if
all the shares referred to in clause (i) have been included, the shares of
Class A Common Stock that the Company proposes to sell, (iii) third, and only
if all the shares referred to in clause (ii) have been included, the number of
Registrable Shares that, in the opinion of such managing underwriter or
underwriters, can be sold without having such adverse effect, with such number
to be allocated _pro rata_ (A) first, among purchasers of Company Common Stock
in any Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction and (B) second, among the Amneal
Group Members, in each of (A) and (B), that have requested to participate in
such offering based on the relative number of Registrable Shares then held by
each such holder ( _provided_ , that any securities thereby allocated to an
Amneal Group Member that exceed such Amneal Group Members request shall be
reallocated among the remaining requesting Amneal Group Members in like
manner) and (iv) fourth, and only if all of the Registrable Shares referred
to in clause (iii) have been included in such Registration, any other
securities eligible for inclusion in such offering. __

 

(c) No registration of Registrable Shares effected pursuant to a request under
this _Section 5.4_ shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to
_Section 5.3_ or shall relieve the Company of its obligations under _Sections
5.1_ through _5.3_.

 

5.5 _Registration Procedures_.

 

(a) In connection with each registration statement prepared pursuant to this
_Article V_ pursuant to which Registrable Shares will be offered and sold,
and in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution of the
Registrable Shares as described in such registration statement, the Company
shall as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

 



24 (i) prepare and file with the SEC such registration statement on an
appropriate registration form of the SEC and use reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof, which
registration statement shall comply as to form in all materials respects with
the requirements of the applicable form and include all financial statements
required by such form to be filed therewith; _provided_ that before filing a
registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto, the Company shall furnish to one counsel selected by Amneal Group
(which such counsel shall be confirmed to the Company in writing (the "
_Counsel_ ")) draft copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (other
than any portion of any thereof which contains information for which the
Company has sought confidential treatment) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable prior to filing (and in any event at least five (5) Business Days
prior to such filing or such shorter time period as may be agreed by the
Amneal Group and the Company), which documents will be subject to the
reasonable review and (except for exhibits) comment of the Amneal Group and
the Counsel and the underwriters in connection with any underwritten
offering, and the Company shall not file any amendment or supplement to the
Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Shelf Registration Statement to which
the Amneal Group or any such underwriters shall reasonably object;

(ii) furnish without charge to each Amneal Group Member and the underwriters,
if any, at least one conformed copy of the registration statement and each
post-effective amendment or supplement thereto (including all schedules and
exhibits but excluding all documents incorporated or deemed incorporated
therein by reference, unless requested in writing by any Amneal Group Member
or an underwriter, except to the extent such exhibits and schedules are
currently available via EDGAR and other than any portion of any thereof which
contains information for which the Company has sought confidential
treatment) and such number of copies of the registration statement and each
amendment or supplement thereto (excluding exhibits and schedules) and the
summary, preliminary, final, amended or supplemented prospectuses included in
such registration statement as each Amneal Group Member or such underwriter
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Shares being sold by such Amneal Group Member
(the Company hereby consents to the use in accordance with the U.S.
securities laws of such registration statement (or post-effective amendment
thereto) and each such prospectus (or preliminary prospectus or supplement
thereto) by such Amneal Group Member and the underwriters, if any, in
connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Shares covered by
such registration statement or prospectus);

(iii) keep such registration statement effective and updated (including the
filing of a new registration statement upon the expiration of a prior one)
with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities subject thereto
until the date on which there are no Registrable Shares (the " _Effective
Period_ "), and prepare and file with the SEC such amendments, post-effective
amendments and supplements to the registration statement and the prospectus as
may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness of the registration for the
Effective Period) and cause the prospectus (and any amendments or supplements
thereto) to be filed with the SEC;

 



25 (iv) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement under such other
securities or "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as
are reasonably necessary, keep such registrations or qualifications in effect
for so long as the registration statement remains in effect, and do any and
all other acts and things which may be reasonably necessary to enable an
Amneal Group Member or any underwriter to consummate the disposition of the
Registrable Shares in such jurisdictions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Company be required to (A) qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not, but for the
requirements of this clause (iv), be required to be so qualified, (B) execute
or file any general consent to service of process under the laws of any
jurisdiction, (C) take any action that would subject it to service of process
in suits other than those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities
covered by the registration statement, or (D) subject itself to taxation in
any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be obligated to do so, but for
this clause (iv);

 

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable Shares covered by
such registration statement to be listed (after notice of issuance) on the
NYSE or on the principal securities exchange or interdealer quotation system
on which Class A Common Stock is then listed or quoted;

 

(vi) promptly notify Amneal Group and the managing underwriter or underwriters
in connection with any underwritten offering after becoming aware thereof,
(A) when the registration statement or any related prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto has been filed, and, with respect to the registration
statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (B) of any request by the SEC or any U.S. state securities
authority for amendments or supplements to the registration statement or the
related prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance by the
SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (D) of the
receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification of the Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or
the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose, or (E) within the Effective
Period of the happening of any event or the existence of any fact which makes
any statement in the registration statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto, prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document
incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or which
requires the making of any changes in the registration statement or post-
effective amendment thereto or any prospectus or amendment or supplement
thereto so that they will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading;

(vii) during the Effective Period, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the withdrawal of any order enjoining or suspending the use or effectiveness
of the registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or the
lifting of any suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable
Shares for sale in any jurisdiction;

 



26 (viii) deliver to Amneal Group and the managing underwriters in connection
with any underwritten offering copies of all correspondence between the SEC
and the Company, its counsel or auditors and all memoranda relating to
discussions with the SEC or its staff with respect to the registration
statement (except to the extent such correspondence is currently available
via EDGAR or relates to information subject to a confidential treatment
request); _provided_ that any such investigation shall not interfere
unreasonably with the Companys business;

 

(ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and registrar for all
Registrable Shares covered by such registration statement not later than the
effective date of such registration statement;

(x) cooperate with Amneal Group and the managing underwriter or underwriters
in connection with any underwritten offering to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Registrable Shares
to be sold under the registration statement in a form eligible for deposit
with the Depository Trust Corporation not bearing any restrictive legends
(other than as required by the Depository Trust Corporation) and not subject
to any stop transfer order with any transfer agent, and cause such Registrable
Shares to be issued in such denominations and registered in such names as the
managing underwriters in connection with any underwritten offering may request
in writing or, if not an underwritten offering, in accordance with the
instructions of the relevant Amneal Group Members, in each case at least two
(2) Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Shares;

(xi) in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, enter into,
concurrently with the relevant Amneal Group Members, an underwriting agreement
customary in form and substance (taking into account the Companys prior
underwriting agreements) for a firm commitment underwritten secondary
offerings of the nature contemplated by the applicable registration statement;

 

(xii) obtain an opinion from the Companys counsel and a "cold comfort" letter
from the Companys independent public accountants (and, if necessary, any
other independent certified public accountants of any Subsidiary of the
Company or of any business acquired by the Company for which financial
statements and financial data is, or is required to be, included in the
registration statement) in customary form and covering such matters as are
customarily covered by such opinions and "cold comfort" letters in connection
with an offering of the nature contemplated by the applicable registration
statement;

(xiii) provide to the Counsel and to the managing underwriters in connection
with any underwritten offering and no later than the time of filing of any
document which is to be incorporated by reference into the registration
statement or prospectus (after the initial filing of such registration
statement), copies of any such document;

 

(xiv) cause its management to use commercially reasonable efforts to support
the marketing of the Registrable Shares covered by a Demand Underwritten
Offering or Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction and make themselves reasonably
available for assistance in the selling effort covered by such transactions,
including, but not limited to, the participation of such members of
the Companys management in road show presentations; and

 



27 (xv) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
and any applicable national securities exchange.

(b) In the event that the Company would be required, pursuant to  _Section
5.5(a)(vi)(E)_ to notify Amneal Group or the managing underwriter or
underwriters in connection with any underwritten offering of the occurrence of
any event specified therein, the Company shall, subject to  _Section
5.5(c)_, as promptly as practicable, prepare and furnish to Amneal Group and
to each such underwriter a reasonable number of copies of a prospectus
supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers
of Registrable Shares that have been registered pursuant to this Agreement,
such prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Each Amneal Group Member agrees that, upon
receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to _Section 5.5(a)(vi)(C)_,
_Section 5.5(a)(vi)(D)_ or _Section 5.5(a)(vi)(E)_ hereof, it shall, and
shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause any sales or placement agent or
agents for the Registrable Shares and the underwriters, if any, to, forthwith
discontinue disposition of the Registrable Shares until such Person shall
have received notice from the Company that such offers and sales of the
Registrable Shares may be resumed and, if applicable, such Person shall have
received copies of such amended or supplemented prospectus and, if so
directed by the Company, to destroy all copies, other than permanent file
copies, then in its possession of the prospectus (prior to such amendment or
supplement) covering such Registrable Shares as soon as practicable after the
Amneal Groups Members receipt of such notice.

(c) In the case of any Demand Underwritten Offering or Piggyback Registration,
all Registrable Shares to be included in such offering or registration, as
the case may be, shall be subject to the applicable underwriting agreement and
no Amneal Group Member may participate in such offering or registration unless
such Amneal Group Member agrees to sell such Amneal Group Members securities
on the basis provided therein and completes and executes all questionnaires,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents which must be
executed in connection therewith, and provides such other information to the
Company or the underwriter as may be reasonably requested to offer or register
such Persons Registrable Shares.

 

5.6 _Obligations of Amneal Group_.

 

(a) _Amneal Group Information_. Each Amneal Group Member shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information (" _Required Amneal Group Member
Information_ ") regarding the Amneal Group Member, the Registrable Shares held
by it and its intended method of distribution of the Registrable Shares as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request in writing, and shall
execute such documents in connection with such registration as may reasonably
be required to effect the registration, in order for the Company to comply
with its obligations under all applicable securities and other laws and to
ensure that the prospectus relating to such Registrable Shares, or any
amendment or supplement to a registration statement or prospectus, conforms to
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and 

 



28  regulations thereunder. If an Amneal Group Member fails to provide the
requested information or execute such documents in connection with such
registration as may reasonably be required to effect the registration within
five (5) Business Days of the receipt by the Amneal Group Member of such
request, the Company shall be entitled to refuse to register such Amneal Group
Members Registrable Shares in the applicable registration statement. Each
Amneal Group Member shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable of any
inaccuracy or change in any Required Amneal Group Member Information
previously furnished by such Amneal Group Member to the Company or of the
occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of which any prospectus
relating to the Registrable Shares contains or would contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in connection
with any registration, and promptly furnish to the Company any additional
information required to correct and update such previously furnished Amneal
Group Member Information or required so that such prospectus shall not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) _Filing Cooperation_. Each Amneal Group Member agrees to cooperate with
the Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of any registration statement in which any Registrable
Shares held by such Amneal Group Member are being included.

 

(c) _Holdback_.

 

(i) The Company shall not effect any public sale or distribution of its equity
securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for such securities, during the ten days prior to and during the 90-day period
beginning on the pricing date in connection with any Demand Underwritten
Offering or a Piggyback Registration, except pursuant to any registrations on
Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any successor form or unless the underwriters managing
any such public offering otherwise agree.

 

(ii) If requested by the managing underwriter(s) for an underwritten offering
(primary or secondary) of any equity securities (or securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for equity securities) of the Company,
each Amneal Group Member hereby agrees not to effect any Transfer of any Class
A Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for Class A Common Stock), including any sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, and not to effect any Transfer of any other equity security of
the Company (in each case, other than as part of such underwritten public
offering) during the ten (10) days prior to, and during the 90-day period (or
such shorter period as the managing underwriter(s) may permit in writing)
beginning on, the effective date of the related registration statement (or
date of the prospectus supplement if the offering is made pursuant to a
"shelf" registration) pursuant to which such underwritten offering shall be
made, provided that all of the Companys executive officers and directors and
any other holders of Class A Common Stock who are selling shares of Class A
Common Stock in such underwritten offering enter into similar agreements for
the same time period and on no less restrictive terms.

 



29 5.7 _Expenses_. Amneal Group shall bear all agent fees and commissions,
underwriting discounts and commissions, and fees and disbursements of its
counsel (including the Counsel) and its accountants in connection with any
registration of any Registrable Shares pursuant to this _Article V_ and any
Company-Assisted PIPE Transaction. The Company shall bear all other fees and
expenses in connection with any registration statement prepared, filed or
caused to become effective pursuant to this _Article V_, including all
registration and filing fees, all printing costs and all fees and expenses of
counsel and accountants for the Company and its Subsidiaries.

5.8 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

(a) In the event any Registrable Shares are included in a registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall, and it hereby
agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless, or cause to be indemnified and held
harmless, each Amneal Group Member and its respective officers, directors,
employees and controlling Persons, if any, in any offering or sale of the
Registrable Shares, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
respect thereof and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel)
(collectively, " _Claims_ "), to which each such indemnified party may become
subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid in settlement
effected with the consent of the Company as provided herein), or actions or
proceedings in respect thereof, arise out of or are based upon an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
registration statement, or any preliminary or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, and the Company shall,
and it hereby agrees to, reimburse, upon request, each such Amneal Group
Member for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred and
documented by them in connection with investigating or defending any such
Claims; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be liable to any
Amneal Group Member (or its officers, directors, employee and controlling
Persons, if any) in any such case to the extent that any such Claims arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement, or
preliminary or final prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto, in
reliance upon and in conformity with the Required Amneal Group Member
Information furnished to the Company in writing by such Amneal Group Member or
on behalf of such Amneal Group Member by any Representative of the Amneal
Group Member, expressly for use therein, that is the subject of the untrue
statement or omission.

(b) In the event any Registrable Shares are included in a registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, each Amneal Group Member shall, and
hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers,
directors, employees and controlling Persons, if any, in any offering or sale
of its Registrable Shares against any Claims to which each such indemnified
party may become subject, insofar as such Claims (including any amounts paid
in settlement as provided herein), or actions or proceedings in respect
thereof, arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, or any
preliminary or final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or any document incorporated by reference therein, or
arise out of or are based upon any omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and each

 



30  Amneal Group Member shall, and it hereby agrees to, reimburse the Company
for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred and
documented by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any
such Claims, in each case only to the extent that such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance
upon and in conformity with the Required Amneal Group Member Information
furnished to the Company in writing by the Amneal Group Member or its
Representative expressly for use therein that is the subject of the untrue
statement or omission; _provided_ , _however_ , that the liability of each
Amneal Group Member hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the
dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Amneal Group Member from
the sale of Registrable Shares sold by such Amneal Group Member pursuant to
such registration statement or prospectus.

(c) Amneal Group and the Company agree that if, for any reason, the
indemnification provisions contemplated by  _Section 5.8(a)_ or _Section
5.8(b)_ are unavailable to or are insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party in respect of any Claims referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such Claims in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the
indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to the applicable offering
of securities. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such
indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. If, however, the allocation in the first sentence
of this _Section 5.8(c)_ is not permitted by applicable law, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only
such relative faults, but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contributions pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ were to be
determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in
the preceding sentences of this _Section 5.8(c)_. The amount paid or payable
by an indemnified party as a result of the Claims referred to above shall be
deemed to include (subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 5.9_)
any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action,
proceeding or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Amneal Group Member shall
be liable to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount equal to
the sum of (i) the net proceeds received by such Amneal Group Member from the
sale of Registrable Shares sold by such Amneal Group Member pursuant to such
registration statement or prospectus, minus (ii) any amounts paid or payable
by such Amneal Group Member pursuant to _Section 5.8(b)_ (except in the case
of fraud or willful misconduct).

 



31 5.9 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under _Section 5.8_ in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Claim against the indemnified party, such indemnified party
shall notify the Company or the Amneal Group Member, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), in writing of such Claim, the amount or the
estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Claim),
any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ ") promptly after receipt by such indemnified
party of written notice of the Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to
provide a Claim Notice shall not affect the indemnification obligations
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the indemnified partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the indemnified party relating to the Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to provide any such copies shall not affect the
indemnification obligations provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any
Claim for which indemnification is being sought, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party and the payment of
all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof.
Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Claim,
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to
pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed
promptly to assume the defense of such Claim and to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; or (3) such indemnified party shall
have been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict of interest
exists if the same counsel were to represent such indemnified party and the
Indemnifying Party or any other indemnified party (in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects
to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume the defense thereof and
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party); _provided_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to not more than one
local counsel that may be required in the opinion of such firm) at any time
for all indemnified parties hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate in defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Claim, the
indemnified party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Claim, and the indemnified party shall
use reasonable best efforts to make employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise

 



32  or discharge, such Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The
Indemnifying Party may pay, settle or compromise a Claim without the written
consent of the indemnified party, so long as such settlement includes (i) an
unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability in respect
of such Claim, (ii) does not subject the indemnified party to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy, and (iii) does not include a statement or
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any
indemnified party.

 

5.10 _Rule 144_. The Company will file the reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such
reports, will, upon the request of Amneal Group, make publicly available other
information) and will take such further action as any Amneal Group Member may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
each Amneal Group Member to sell Class A Common Stock without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by
(i) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time
to time or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.
Upon the reasonable request of any Amneal Group Member, the Company will
deliver to such parties a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements and will, at its expense, forthwith upon the request of
any such Amneal Group Member, deliver to such Amneal Group Member a
certificate, signed by the Companys principal financial officer, stating (a)
the Companys name, address and telephone number (including area code), (b)
the Companys Internal Revenue Service identification number, (c) the
Companys SEC file number, (d) the number of shares of each class of capital

FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION

 

Unless otherwise expressly provided, each of the covenants and agreements in
this _Article VI_ shall terminate at the end of the fiscal year of the
Company in which the Trigger Date occurs:

6.1 _Exchange of Information_. Until the end of the fiscal year of the
Company in which the Trigger Date occurs, each of the members of Amneal Group
and the Company Group, on behalf of itself and the other members of its
respective Group, agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or
cause to be provided, to the other, at any time after the date hereof, as
soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Information
in the possession or under the control of such respective Group which the
requesting party reasonably needs to comply with reporting, disclosure or
filing requirements imposed on the requesting party or a member of its Group
(including under applicable securities or Tax Laws) by a Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over the requesting party or such member of its Group;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any Party determines that any
such provision of Information could be commercially detrimental, violate any
Law or agreement, or waive any attorney-client privilege, the Parties
shall take reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such obligations
in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence. In connection therewith,
each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to
reasonable requests from the other Party for information regarding the
Information delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ and, if requested, shall
make appropriate personnel available to discuss such Information.

 

6.2 _Ownership of Information_. Any Information owned by one Group that is
provided to a requesting Party pursuant to  _Section 6.1_ shall be deemed to
remain the property of the providing Group. Unless specifically set forth
herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or
conferring rights of license or otherwise in any such Information.

6.3 _Compensation for Providing Information_. In connection with Information
exchanged pursuant to  _Section 6.1_, the Party requesting Information
agrees to reimburse the other Party for the reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket costs, if any, of creating, gathering and copying such Information or
otherwise performing, to the extent that such costs are incurred for the
benefit of the requesting Party. Except as may be otherwise specifically
provided elsewhere in this Agreement, or in any other agreement between the
Parties, such costs shall be computed in accordance with the providing
Partys standard methodology and procedures.

6.4 _Record Retention_. To facilitate the possible exchange of Information
pursuant to this _Article VI_ and other provisions of this Agreement, Amneal
Group and the Company agree to use their reasonable best efforts to retain all
Information in their respective possession or control in accordance with the
policies of Amneal Group as in effect on the date of the Closing, to the
extent such policies are communicated in writing to the Company reasonably in
advance, or such other policies as may be reasonably adopted by the
appropriate Party after the date hereof. Neither Party will destroy, or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information which

 



34  the other Party may have the right to obtain pursuant to this Agreement
prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of the Closing without first using
its reasonable best efforts to notify the other Party of the proposed
destruction and giving the other Party the opportunity to take possession of
such Information prior to such destruction; _provided_ , _however_ , no Party
will destroy, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to destroy, any Information
required to be retained by applicable Law.

6.5 _Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Except in the case of an adversarial Action by one Party against another
Party, each member of Amneal Group and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make available to each other Party, upon written request, the
former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel and
agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books,
records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the
ability to make available, to the extent that any such person (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents may
reasonably be required in connection with any Action in which the requesting
Party may from time to time be involved. The requesting Party shall bear all
costs and expenses in connection therewith.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Amneal Group and the Company shall
cooperate and consult to the extent reasonably necessary with respect to any
Actions.

(c) In connection with any matter contemplated by this _Section 6.5_, Amneal
Group and the Company intend to and will maintain any applicable attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, and other applicable privileges,
doctrines, or immunities of any member of any Group.

 

6.6 _Privilege_. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the provision of any
information pursuant to this _Article VI_ shall not be deemed a waiver of
any privilege, including privileges arising under or related to the attorney-
client privilege or any other applicable privilege (a " _Privilege_ ").
Neither the Company or any member of the Company Group nor any member of
Amneal Group will be required to provide any information pursuant to this
_Article VI_ if the provision of such information would serve as a waiver of
any Privilege afforded such information.

following the date such Company Confidential Information was disclosed to

by Amneal Group or any of their respective Affiliates (other than any member
of the Company Group) furnished to or in the possession of any member of the
Company Group, irrespective of the form of communication, and all notes,

other documents prepared by the Company, any member of the Company Group or
their respective officers, directors and Affiliates, that contain or otherwise
reflect such Information is hereinafter referred to as " _Amneal Confidential
Information_." Amneal Confidential Information does not include, and there
shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to, information that (i) is or
becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of a
disclosure by any member of the Company Group not otherwise permissible
hereunder, (ii) the Company can demonstrate was or became available to any
member of the Company Group from a source other than Amneal Group or its
Affiliates or (iii) is developed independently by a member of the Company

was not known by a member of the Company Group to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to, any member of Amneal Group with respect to
such information. In the event any member of the Company Group receives
Amneal Confidential Information after the Trigger Date, the Company shall keep
and shall cause its Representatives to keep such Amneal Confidential
Information confidential for the period of one (1) year following the date
such Amneal Confidential Information was disclosed to the Company Group.

Affiliates, on the other hand, are requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) by any Governmental Entity or
pursuant to applicable Law or stock exchange requirements to disclose or
provide any Company Confidential Information or Amneal Confidential
Information, as applicable, the Person receiving such request or demand, or
so required by applicable Law or stock exchange requirements, shall, to the
extent practicable and legally permissible, promptly provide the other Party
with advance written notice of such request, demand or requirement and will
reasonably cooperate other Party (at such other Partys sole expense) with
the other Partys efforts to seek confidential treatment of any Confidential
Information to be disclosed and/or to obtain a protective order narrowing the
scope of disclosure. Confidential Information that is disclosed pursuant to
this _Section 7.2(c)_ will remain otherwise subject to the confidentiality
and non-use provisions set forth herein. Subject to the foregoing, the Party
that received such request or demand may thereafter disclose or provide any
Company Confidential Information or Amneal Confidential Information, as the
case may be, only to the extent required by such Law or stock exchange
requirement (as so advised by counsel) or by lawful process or such
Governmental Entity.

This Conflicts Committee Charter (the " _Charter_ ") has been adopted by the
Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Board_ ") of Atlas Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").



   I. | Purpose 
---|--- 

The Conflicts Committee (the " _Committee_ ") of the Company Board is
responsible for providing leadership and guidance to the Company Board and the
Company regarding transactions or situations involving potential conflicts of
interest between any member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and any
member of Amneal Group, or any director, officer, employee or associate of
any Amneal Group Member, on the other hand.

This Charter is intended to implement the provisions of the Stockholders
Agreement, dated as of October 17, 2017, by and among the Company and Amneal
Group, as defined therein (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "). Capitalized
terms used in this Charter but not otherwise defined have the meanings given
to such terms in the Stockholders Agreement. In the event of any conflict
between this Charter and the Stockholders Agreement, the provisions of the
Stockholders Agreement shall prevail.

 



   II. | Term and Composition 
---|--- 

The Committee shall exist until the first date on which Amneal Group ceases
to beneficially own at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of
the Company Common Stock.

The number of directors which constitute the Committee shall be determined by
the Company Board from time to time. The Committee shall be comprised solely
of Company Independent Directors appointed to serve on the Committee by a
majority of the Company Independent Directors then serving on the Company
Board. The Company Board shall elect or appoint a chairperson of the Committee
(or, if it does not do so, the Committee members shall elect a chairperson by
vote of a majority of the full Committee). The members of the Committee shall
serve for a term of one year or until their successors shall be appointed and

and other law as in effect on the Early Termination Effective Date, except to

the date that any Tax Return to which such payment obligation relates is

11 ARTICLE II.

 

DETERMINATION OF REALIZED TAX BENEFIT

 

Section 2.1 _Basis Adjustments;_ _Amneal_ _LLC 754 Election_.

 

(a) _Basis Adjustments_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) each
Redemption shall be treated as a direct purchase of Units by the Corporation
from the applicable Member pursuant to Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code and
(B) each Exchange will give rise to Basis Adjustments. For the avoidance of
doubt, payments made under this Agreement shall not be treated as resulting
in a Basis Adjustment to the extent such payments are treated as Imputed
Interest or Default Rate Interest. Further, the Parties intend that Basis
Adjustments be calculated in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.743-1.

(b) _Amneal LLC Section_ __ _ 754 Election_. In its capacity as the sole
managing member of Amneal LLC, the Corporation will ensure that, on and after
the date hereof and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement, Amneal
LLC and each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (including any successors
to Amneal LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries arising as a result of
terminations occurring pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code) that is
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes will have in
effect an election under Section 754 of the Code (and under any similar
provisions of applicable U.S. state or local law) for each Taxable Year;
_provided_ that with respect to any direct or indirect subsidiary of Amneal
LLC that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes for
which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries do not have the authority
under the governing documents of such subsidiary to cause or are otherwise
prohibited from causing such subsidiary to have in effect an election under
Section 754 of the Code (or under any similar provisions of applicable U.S.
state or local law), the Corporation shall only be required to take
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such subsidiary to have such an
election in effect.

Section 2.2 _Basis Schedules_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the
filing of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Corporation for each
relevant Taxable Year, the Corporation shall, at its own expense, prepare,
with assistance from the Advisory Firm, and deliver to the Members a schedule
(the " _Basis Schedule_ ") that shows, in reasonable detail as necessary in
order to understand the calculations performed under this Agreement: (a) the
Basis Adjustments with respect to the Reference Assets as a result of the
relevant Exchanges effected in such Taxable Year, calculated (I) in the
aggregate (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Exchanges by all Members)
and (II) solely with respect to Exchanges by the applicable Member; (b) the
period (or periods) over which the Reference Assets are amortizable and/or
depreciable; and (c) the period (or periods) over which each Basis Adjustment
is amortizable and/or depreciable. The Basis Schedule will become final and
binding on the Parties pursuant to the procedures set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 2.4(a)_ and may be amended by the Parties pursuant to the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_.

 



12 Section 2.3 _Tax Benefit Schedules._

 

(a) _Tax Benefit Schedule_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing
of the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the Corporation for any Taxable Year
in which there is a Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment, the
Corporation shall, at its own expense, prepare, with assistance from the
Advisory Firm, and deliver to the Members a schedule showing, in reasonable
detail, the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment
for such Taxable Year (a " _Tax Benefit Schedule_ "). The Tax Benefit Schedule
will become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_, and may be amended by the Parties pursuant
to the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_.

 

(b) _Applicable Principles_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for each Taxable Year is
intended to measure the decrease or increase in the Actual Tax Liability of
the Corporation for such Taxable Year attributable to the Basis Adjustments
and Imputed Interest, as determined using a "with and without" methodology
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_. Carryovers or carrybacks of any tax item
attributable to any Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest shall be considered
to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations or the
appropriate provisions of U.S. state and local tax law, as applicable,
governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of
the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any tax item includes a
portion that is attributable to a Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest (a "
_TRA Portion_ ") and another portion that is not (a " _Non-TRA Portion_"),
such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with the "with and
without" methodology so that: (i) the amount of any Non-TRA Portion is deemed
utilized first, followed by the amount of any TRA Portion (with the
TRA Portion being applied on a proportionate basis consistent with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a))_; and (ii) in the case of a carryback of
a Non-TRA Portion, such carryback shall not affect the original "with and
without" calculation made in the prior Taxable Year. The Parties agree that,
subject to the second to last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, all Tax
Benefit Payments attributable to an Exchange will be treated as subsequent
upward purchase price adjustments that give rise to further Basis Adjustments
for the Corporation beginning in the Taxable Year of payment, and as a result,
such additional Basis Adjustments will be incorporated into such Taxable Year
continuing for future Taxable Years until any incremental Basis Adjustment
benefits with respect to a Tax Benefit Payment equals an immaterial amount.

 

Section 2.4 _Procedures; Amendments_.

 

(a) _Procedures_. Each time the Corporation delivers an applicable Schedule to
the Members under this Agreement, including any Amended Schedule delivered
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4(b)_, but excluding any Early Termination
Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule delivered pursuant to the
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.2_, the Corporation shall also, at
its own expense: (x) deliver supporting schedules and work papers, as
determined in good faith by the Corporation or as reasonably requested by any
Member, that provide a reasonable level of detail regarding the data and
calculations that were relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule; (y)
deliver an Advisory Firm Letter supporting such Schedule (or, if the Advisory
Firm cannot as a general matter of such Advisory Firms internal policies
deliver Advisory Firm Letters, a Corporation Letter); and (z) allow the
Members and their advisors to have reasonable access to the appropriate
representatives, as determined in good faith by the Corporation or as
reasonably requested by the Members, at the Corporation and the Advisory Firm
in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the generality
of the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall ensure that any Tax Benefit
Schedule that is delivered to the Members, along with any supporting
schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed presentation of the
calculation of the Actual Tax Liability of the Corporation for the relevant
Taxable Year (the "with" calculation) and the Hypothetical Tax Liability of
the Corporation for such Taxable Year (the "without" calculation), and
identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles that
were used

 



13 for purposes of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto
shall become final and binding on the Parties thirty (30) calendar days from
the date on which the Members first received the applicable Schedule or
amendment thereto unless:

 

(i) a Member within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the applicable
Schedule or amendment thereto, provides the Corporation with written notice
of a material objection to such Schedule that is made in good faith and that
sets forth in reasonable detail such Members material objection (an "
_Objection Notice_ "); or

 

(ii) each Member provides a written waiver of its right to deliver an
Objection Notice within the time period described in clause (i) above, in
which case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the
waiver from all Members is received by the Corporation.

 

In the event that a Member timely delivers an Objection Notice pursuant to
clause (i) above, and if the Parties, for any reason, are unable
to successfully resolve the issues raised in the Objection Notice within
thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporation of the Objection
Notice, the Corporation and the Member shall employ the reconciliation
procedures as described in  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ of this Agreement (the "
_Reconciliation Procedures_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, to the extent that supporting schedules or work papers are requested
pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) by a Member that (x) was not a member of
Amneal LLC as of the date hereof, (y) does not hold directly or indirectly,
together with Persons under common control with such Member, on an aggregate
basis, at least five percent (5%) of the outstanding Units on the date of
such Members request and (z) would not be entitled to receive directly or
indirectly, together with Persons under common control with such Member, on an
aggregate basis, at least five percent (5%) of the aggregate amount of all
Early Termination Payments payable to all Members hereunder if the Corporation
exercised its right of early termination on the date of such Members request,
the cost of preparing such supporting schedules or work papers shall be borne
solely by such requesting Member by set-off against the next Tax Benefit
Payment to be made to such requesting Member pursuant to Section 3.1(a).

 

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be
amended from time to time by the Corporation, at its own expense: (i) in
connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule; (ii) to correct
inaccuracies in the Schedule identified as a result of the receipt of
additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date
the Schedule was originally provided to the Members; (iii) to comply with an
Experts determination under the Reconciliation Procedures applicable to this
Agreement; (iv) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized
Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or
carryforward of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year; (v) to reflect
a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such
Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable
Year; or (vi) to adjust a Basis Schedule to take into account any Tax Benefit
Payments made pursuant to this Agreement (any such Schedule, an " _Amended
Schedule_ ").

 



14 ARTICLE III.

 

TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS

 

Section 3.1 _Timing and Amount of Tax Benefit Payments_.

 

(a) _Timing of Payments_. Subject to _Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_ , within three
(3) Business Days following the date on which each Tax Benefit Schedule that
is required to be delivered by the Corporation to the Members pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ of this Agreement becomes final in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ of this Agreement (such date, the " _Final Payment
Date_ " in respect of any Tax Benefit Payment), the Corporation shall pay to
each relevant Member the Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_. Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account previously
designated by such Members or as otherwise agreed by the Corporation and such
Members. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members shall not be required under
any circumstances to return any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously
paid by the Corporation to the Members (including any portion of any Early
Termination Payment). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at the
election of a Member, the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments in respect of an
Exchange (other than amounts accounted for as interest under the Code) shall
not exceed an amount specified by the exchanging Member in the notice
described in the following sentence. The election described in the prior
sentence shall be made by an exchanging Member by providing written notice to
the Corporation, as described in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, no later than the last
day of such Members taxable year that includes such Exchange.

(b) _Amount of Payments_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Tax Benefit
Payment_ " with respect to any Member means an amount, not less than zero,
equal to the sum of: (i) the Net Tax Benefit that is Attributable to such
Member and (ii) the Actual Interest Amount.

 

(i) _Attributable_. A Net Tax Benefit is " _Attributable_ " to a Member to the
extent that it is derived from any Basis Adjustment or Imputed Interest that
is attributable to an Exchange undertaken by or with respect to such Member.

 

(ii) _Net Tax Benefit_. The " _Net Tax Benefit_ " Attributable to a Member for
a Taxable Year equals the amount of the excess, if any, of (x) 85% of the
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit Attributable to such Member as of the end
of such Taxable Year over (y) the aggregate amount of all Tax Benefit Payments
previously made to such Member under this _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit that is
Attributable to a Member as of the end of any Taxable Year is less than the
aggregate amount of all Tax Benefit Payments previously made to such Member,
such Member shall not be required to return any portion of any Tax Benefit
Payment previously made by the Corporation to such Member.

 

(iii) _Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit_. The " _Cumulative Net Realized
Tax Benefit_ " for a Taxable Year equals the cumulative amount of Realized
Tax Benefits for all Taxable Years of the Corporation, up to and including
such Taxable Year, net of the cumulative amount of Realized Tax Detriments for
the same period. The Realized Tax Benefit and Realized Tax Detriment for each
Taxable Year shall be determined based on the most recent Tax Benefit Schedule
or Amended Schedule, if any, in existence at the time of such determination.

 



15 (iv) _Realized Tax Benefit_. The " _Realized Tax Benefit_ " for a Taxable
Year equals the excess, if any, of the Hypothetical Tax Liability over the
Actual Tax Liability for such Taxable Year. If all or a portion of the Actual
Tax Liability for such Taxable Year arises as a result of an audit or
similar proceeding by a Taxing Authority of any Taxable Year, such liability
shall not be included in determining the Realized Tax Benefit unless and until
there has been a Determination.

 

(v) _Realized Tax Detriment_. The " _Realized Tax Detriment_ " for a Taxable
Year equals the excess, if any, of the Actual Tax Liability over the
Hypothetical Tax Liability for such Taxable Year. If all or a portion of the
Actual Tax Liability for such Taxable Year arises as a result of an audit or
similar proceeding by a Taxing Authority of any Taxable Year, such liability
shall not be included in determining the Realized Tax Detriment unless and
until there has been a Determination.

 

(vi) _Imputed Interest_. The principles of Sections 1272, 1274, or 483 of the
Code, as applicable, and the principles of any similar provision of U.S.
state and local law, will apply to cause a portion of any Tax Benefit Payment
payable by the Corporation to a Member under this Agreement to be treated as
imputed interest (" _Imputed Interest_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the
deduction for the amount of Imputed Interest as determined with respect to any
Tax Benefit Payment payable by the Corporation to a Member shall be excluded
in determining the Hypothetical Tax Liability of the Corporation for purposes
of calculating Realized Tax Benefits and Realized Tax Detriments pursuant to
this Agreement.

(vii) _Actual Interest Amount_. The " _Actual Interest Amount_ " calculated
in respect of the Net Tax Benefit for a Taxable Year will equal the amount of
any Extension Rate Interest.

 

(viii) _Extension Rate Interest_. The amount of " _Extension Rate Interest_ "
calculated in respect of the Net Tax Benefit (including previously accrued
Imputed Interest) for a Taxable Year will equal interest calculated at the
Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions) for filing the U.S. federal
income Tax Return of the Corporation for such Taxable Year until the date on
which the Corporation makes a timely Tax Benefit Payment to the Member on or
before the Final Payment Date as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)_.

 

(ix) _Default Rate Interest_. In the event that the Corporation does not make
timely payment of all or any portion of a Tax Benefit Payment to a Member on
or before the Final Payment Date as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)_, the amount of " _Default Rate Interest_ " calculated in respect of
the Net Tax Benefit (including previously accrued Imputed Interest and
Extension Rate Interest) for a Taxable Year will equal interest calculated at
the Default Rate from the Final Payment Date for a Tax Benefit Payment as
determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ until the date on which the
Corporation makes such Tax Benefit Payment to such Member. For the avoidance
of doubt, any deduction for any Default Rate Interest as determined with
respect to any Net Tax Benefit payable by the Corporation to a Member shall
be included in the Hypothetical Tax Liability of the Corporation for purposes
of calculating Realized Tax Benefits and Realized Tax Detriments pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



16 (x) Except as provided in an election, if any, made pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 3.1(a)_, the Corporation and the Members hereby acknowledge and agree that,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the date of any future Exchange
that may be subject to this Agreement, the aggregate value of the Tax Benefit
Payments cannot be reasonably ascertained for U.S. federal income or other
applicable tax purposes.

(c) _Interest_. The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)_ are intended to
operate so that interest will effectively accrue in respect of the Net Tax
Benefit for any Taxable Year as follows:

 

(i) first, at the applicable rate used to determine the amount of Imputed
Interest under the Code (from the relevant Exchange Date until the due date
(without extensions) for filing the U.S. federal income Tax Return of the
Corporation for such Taxable Year);

 

(ii) second, at the Agreed Rate in respect of any Extension Rate Interest
(from the due date (without extensions) for filing the U.S. federal income
Tax Return of the Corporation for such Taxable Year until the Final Payment
Date for a Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.1(a)_); and

 

(iii) third, at the Default Rate in respect of any Default Rate Interest (from
the Final Payment Date for a Tax Benefit Payment as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.1(a)_ until the date on which the Corporation makes the
relevant Tax Benefit Payment to a Member).

 

Section 3.2 _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the provisions of
this Agreement will not result in the duplicative payment of any amount
(including interest) that may be required under this Agreement, and the
provisions of this Agreement shall be consistently interpreted and applied in
accordance with that intent. For purposes of this Agreement, and also for
the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be calculated or made in
respect of any estimated tax payments, including, without limitation, any
estimated U.S. federal income tax payments.

 

Section 3.3 _Pro-Ration of Payments as Between the Members_.

 

(a) _Insufficient Taxable Income_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_ to the contrary, if the aggregate potential Covered Tax benefit of
the Corporation as calculated with respect to the Basis Adjustments and
Imputed Interest (in each case, without regard to the Taxable Year of
origination) is limited in a particular Taxable Year because the Corporation
does not have sufficient actual taxable income, then the available Covered Tax
benefit for the Corporation shall be allocated among the Members in proportion
to the respective Tax Benefit Payments that would have been payable if
the Corporation had in fact had sufficient taxable income so that there had
been no such limitation. As an illustration of the intended operation of this
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_, if the Corporation had $200 of aggregate
potential Covered Tax benefits with respect to the Basis Adjustments and
Imputed Interest in a particular Taxable Year (with $50 of

 



17 such Covered Tax benefits being attributable to Member 1 and $150 of such
Covered Tax benefits being attributable to Member 2), such that Member 1
would have potentially been entitled to a Tax Benefit Payment of $42.50 and
Member 2 would have been entitled to a Tax Benefit Payment of $127.50 if the
Corporation had $200 of taxable income, and if at the same time the
Corporation only had $100 of actual taxable income in such Taxable Year, then
$25 of the aggregate $100 actual Covered Tax benefit for the Corporation for
such Taxable Year would be allocated to Member 1 and $75 of the aggregate $100
actual Covered Tax benefit for the Corporation would be allocated to Member
2, such that Member 1 would receive a Tax Benefit Payment of $21.25 and Member
2 would receive a Tax Benefit Payment of $63.75.

 

(b) _Late Payments_. If for any reason the Corporation is not able to timely
and fully satisfy its payment obligations under this Agreement in respect of
a particular Taxable Year, then Default Rate Interest will begin to accrue
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ and the Corporation and other Parties agree
that (i) the Corporation shall pay the Tax Benefit Payments due in respect of
such Taxable Year to each Member pro rata in accordance with the principles of
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payment shall be made in
respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments to all Members in
respect of all prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

ARTICLE IV.

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 4.1 _Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement_.

 

(a) _Corporation s Early Termination Right_. With the written approval of a
majority of the Independent Directors, the Corporation may completely
terminate this Agreement, as and to the extent provided herein, with respect
to all amounts payable to the Members pursuant to this Agreement by paying to
the Members the Early Termination Payment; _provided_ that Early Termination
Payments may be made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ only if made in
full and simultaneously to all Members that are entitled to such a payment,
and _provided further_ , that the Corporation may withdraw any notice to
execute its termination rights under this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ prior to the
time at which any Early Termination Payment has been paid. Upon the
Corporations payment of the Early Termination Payment, the Corporation shall
not have any further payment obligations under this Agreement, other than with
respect to any: (i) prior Tax Benefit Payments that are due and payable under
this Agreement but that still remain unpaid as of the date of the Early
Termination Notice; and (ii) current Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable
Year ending on or including the date of the Early Termination Notice (except
to the extent that the amount described in clause (ii) is included in
the calculation of the Early Termination Payment). If an Exchange
subsequently occurs with respect to Units for which the Corporation has
exercised its termination rights under this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, the
Corporation shall have no obligations under this Agreement with respect to
such Exchange.

(b) _Acceleration Upon Change of Control_. In the event of a Change of
Control, all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and such obligations
shall be calculated pursuant to this _Article IV_ as if an Early Termination
Notice had been delivered on the closing date of the Change of Control and
utilizing the Valuation Assumptions by substituting the phrase "the closing
date of a Change of Control" in each place where the phrase "Early Termination
Effective Date" appears. Such obligations shall include, but not be limited
to, (1) the Early Termination Payment calculated as if an Early Termination
Notice had been delivered on the closing date of the Change of Control, (2)
any Tax Benefit Payments agreed to by the Corporation and the Members as due
and payable but unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and (3) any Tax
Benefit Payments due for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including
the closing date of a Change of Control (except to the extent that any amounts
described in clauses (2) or (3) are included in the Early Termination
Payment). For the avoidance of doubt, _Sections 4.2_ and _4.3_ shall apply to
a Change of Control, _mutadis mutandi._

 



18 (c) _Acceleration Upon Breach of Agreement_. In the event that the Corporation
materially breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement,
whether as a result of failure to make any payment when due, failure to honor
any other material obligation required hereunder, or by operation of law as a
result of the rejection of this Agreement in a case commenced under the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then all obligations hereunder shall be
accelerated and become immediately due and payable upon notice of acceleration
from any Member ( _provided_ that in the case of any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency statute, such acceleration shall be
automatic without any such notice), and such obligations shall be calculated
as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of
such notice of acceleration (or, in the case of any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency statute, on the date of such breach) and
shall include, but not be limited to: (i) the Early Termination Payment
calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date
of such acceleration; (ii) any prior Tax Benefit Payments that are due and
payable under this Agreement but that still remain unpaid as of the date of
such acceleration; and (iii) any current Tax Benefit Payment due for the
Taxable Year ending with or including the date of such acceleration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation breaches this
Agreement and such breach is not a material breach of a material obligation,
a Member shall still be entitled to enforce all of its rights otherwise
available under this Agreement, including by seeking an acceleration of
amounts payable under this Agreement. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _
4.1(c)_, and subject to the following sentence, the Parties agree that the
failure to make any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within thirty (30)
days of the relevant Final Payment Date shall be deemed to be a material
breach of a material obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this
Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a material breach of a
material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to
this Agreement within thirty (30) days of the relevant Final Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a
material breach of a material obligation of this Agreement if the Corporation
fails to make any Tax Benefit Payment within thirty (30) days of the relevant
Final Payment Date to the extent that the Corporation has insufficient funds,
or cannot take commercially reasonable actions to obtain sufficient funds, to
make such payment;  _provided_ that the interest provisions of _Section_ __ _
5.2_ shall apply to such late payment (unless the Corporation does not have
sufficient funds to make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by
any Senior Obligations, in which case _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall apply, but
the Default Rate shall be replaced by the Agreed Rate).

 

Section 4.2 _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporation chooses to exercise
its right of early termination under  _Section_ __ _ 4.1_ above, the
Corporation shall deliver to the Members a notice of the Corporations
decision to exercise such right (an " _Early Termination Notice_ ") and a
schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") showing in reasonable detail
the calculation of the Early Termination Payment. The Corporation shall also
(x) deliver supporting schedules and work papers, as determined in good faith
by the Corporation or as reasonably requested by a Member, that provide a
reasonable level of detail regarding the data and calculations that were
relevant for purposes of preparing the Early Termination Schedule; (y) deliver
an Advisory Firm Letter (or, if the Advisory Firm cannot as a general matter
of such Advisory Firms internal policies deliver Advisory Firm Letters, a
Corporation Letter) supporting such Early Termination Schedule; and (z) allow
the Members and their advisors to have reasonable access to the appropriate
representatives, as determined in good faith by the Corporation or as
reasonably requested by any Member, at the Corporation and the Advisory Firm
in connection with a review of such Early Termination Schedule. The Early
Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on each Party thirty (30)
calendar days from the first date on which the Members received such Early
Termination Schedule unless:

 

(i) a Member within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the Early
Termination Schedule, provides the Corporation with notice of a material
objection to such Early Termination Schedule made in good faith and setting
forth in reasonable detail such Members material objection (a " _Termination
Objection Notice_ "); or

 

(ii) each Member provides a written waiver of such right of a Termination
Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which
case such Early Termination Schedule becomes binding on the date the waiver
from all Members is received by the Corporation.

 



19 In the event that a Member timely delivers a Termination Objection Notice
pursuant to clause (i) above, and if the Parties, for any reason, are unable
to successfully resolve the issues raised in the Termination Objection Notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporation of the
Termination Objection Notice, the Corporation and such Member shall employ
the Reconciliation Procedures. The date on which the Early Termination
Schedule becomes final in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ shall be
the " _Early Termination Reference Date_." 

Section 4.3 _Payment_ _Upon_ _Early Termination_.

 

(a) _Timing of Payment_. Within three (3) Business Days after the Early
Termination Reference Date, the Corporation shall pay to each Member an
amount equal to the Early Termination Payment for such Member. Such Early
Termination Payment shall be made by the Corporation by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by the
Members or as otherwise agreed by the Corporation and the Members.

(b) _Amount of Payment_. The " _Early Termination Payment_ " payable to a
Member pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.3(a)_ shall equal the present value,
discounted at the Early Termination Rate as determined as of the Early
Termination Reference Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would
be required to be paid by the Corporation to such Member, whether payable
with respect to Units that were Exchanged prior to or on the Early Termination
Effective Date, or are deemed to be Exchanged on the Early Termination
Effective Date pursuant to the Valuation Assumptions, beginning from the
Early Termination Effective Date and using the Valuation Assumptions. For the
avoidance of doubt, an Early Termination Payment shall be made to each Member,
regardless of whether such Member has Exchanged all of its Units as of the
Early Termination Effective Date.

 



20 ARTICLE V.

 

SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS

 

Section 5.1 _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination
Payment required to be made by the Corporation to the Members under this
Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to any
principal, interest, or other amounts due and payable in respect of any
obligations owed in respect of secured indebtedness for borrowed money of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries (" _Senior Obligations_ ") and shall rank
_pari_ ___passu_ in right of payment with all current or future unsecured
obligations of the Corporation that are not Senior Obligations. To the extent
that any payment under this Agreement is not permitted to be made at the time
payment is due as a result of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and the terms of the
agreements governing Senior Obligations, such payment obligation nevertheless
shall accrue for the benefit of the Members and the Corporation shall make
such payments at the first opportunity that such payments are permitted to be
made in accordance with the terms of the Senior Obligations. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the terms of the agreements governing Senior Obligations to allow
payments to be made under this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2 _Late Payments by the Corporation_. The amount of all or any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to
any Member when due under the terms of this Agreement, whether as a result of
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and the terms of the Senior Obligations or otherwise,
shall be payable together with Default Rate Interest, which shall accrue
beginning on the Final Payment Date and be computed as provided in _Section_
__ _ 3.1(b_ _)(_ _ix)_.

 

ARTICLE VI.

TAX MATTERS; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION

Section 6.1 _Participation in the Corporation_ __ _s and_ _Amneal_ _ LLC_
__ _s Tax Matters_. Except as otherwise provided herein, and except as
provided in Section 9.03 of the LLC Agreement, the Corporation shall have full
responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all tax matters concerning the
Corporation and Amneal LLC, including without limitation the preparation,
filing or amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any
issue pertaining to taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation
shall notify the Members of, and keep them reasonably informed with respect
to, the portion of any tax audit of the Corporation or Amneal LLC, or any of
Amneal LLCs subsidiaries, the outcome of which is reasonably expected to
materially affect the Tax Benefit Payments payable to any Member under this
Agreement, and the Member Representative, shall have the right to participate
in and to monitor at its own expense (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not to
control) any such portion of any such Tax audit; provided that the
Corporation shall not settle or fail to contest any issue pertaining to
Covered Taxes that is reasonably expected to materially adversely affect any
Members rights or obligations under this Agreement (including the amount
or timing of any payment made hereunder) without the prior written consent of
the Member Representative. In addition to the foregoing, the Corporation shall
not take any action outside the ordinary course of business (other than
exercising its early termination right under _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_) a
principal purpose of which is to minimize Tax Benefit Payments determined in
accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this sentence shall be construed to in any way limit or otherwise
prohibit the Corporation from exercising its rights pursuant to this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_).

 

Section 6.2 _Consistency_. All calculations and determinations made hereunder,
including, without limitation, any Basis Adjustments, the Schedules, and the
determination of any Realized Tax Benefits or Realized Tax Detriments, shall
be made in accordance with the elections, methodologies or positions taken by
the Corporation and Amneal LLC on their respective Tax Returns. Each Member
shall prepare its Tax Returns in a manner that is consistent with the terms of
this Agreement, and any related calculations or determinations that are made
hereunder, including, without limitation, the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
of this Agreement and the Schedules provided to the Members under this
Agreement. In the event that an Advisory Firm is replaced with another
Advisory Firm acceptable to the Audit Committee, such replacement Advisory
Firm shall perform its services under this Agreement using procedures and
methodologies consistent with the previous Advisory Firm, unless otherwise
required by law or unless the Corporation and all of the Members agree to the
use of other procedures and methodologies.

 



21 Section 6.3 _Cooperation_.

 

(a) Each Member shall (i) furnish to the Corporation in a timely manner such
information, documents and other materials as the Corporation may reasonably
request for purposes of making any determination or computation necessary or
appropriate under this Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or
defending any audit, examination or controversy with any Taxing
Authority, (ii) make itself available to the Corporation and its
representatives to provide explanations of documents and materials and such
other information as the Corporation or its representatives may reasonably
request in connection with any of the matters described in clause (i) above,
and (iii) reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter. For the
avoidance of doubt, no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to
require any Member to provide any other party any right to access or review
any Tax Return, tax work papers, or other proprietary or confidential
information of such Member.

(b) The Corporation shall reimburse the Members for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 6.3(a)_. 

Section 6.4 _Approvals_.

 

(a) Neither the Corporation, Amneal LLC nor any direct or indirect subsidiary
of Amneal LLC that is treated as a partnership or is disregarded as separate
from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall sell, exchange or
otherwise dispose of any asset held on or prior to the Closing Date by Amneal
LLC or any entity that was a subsidiary of Amneal LLC prior to the Closing
Date in any twelve (12) month period if, following such disposition, the
cumulative "amount realized" (as that term is defined in Section 1001 of the
Code) from all such dispositions during such twelve (12) month period would be
in excess of $40,000,000, unless (i) the Membership Representative provides
its prior written consent to such transaction (which consent may be granted or
withheld in the Member Representatives sole discretion) or (ii) the
Corporation agrees to use its best efforts to ensure that, during the taxable
periods in which any Member is allocated gain attributable to such
transaction, each such Member receives distributions pursuant to Section
4.01(b) of the LLC Agreement equal to its Assumed Tax Liability.

 



22 (b) Neither the Corporation, Amneal LLC nor any of their respective Affiliates
shall make a Subsequent Acquisition if the Subsequent Acquisition Tax
Benefits from such Subsequent Acquisition and all prior Subsequent
Acquisitions could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect any Members rights or obligations under this Agreement
(including the amount or timing of any payment made hereunder) without the
prior written consent of the Member Representative, which consent may be
granted or withheld in the Member Representatives sole discretion.

(c) Neither the Corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall enter into any
additional agreement providing rights similar to this Agreement to any Person
(including any agreement pursuant to which the Corporation is obligated to pay
amounts with respect to tax benefits resulting from any net operating losses
or other tax attributes to which the Corporation becomes entitled as a result
of a transaction) without the prior written consent of the Member
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless all payments to be made by the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries pursuant to such agreement are expressly subordinate in
right of payment to all payments to be made hereunder.

 

Section 6.5 _Tax Attributes_. All net operating losses and other tax
attributes of the Corporation (or any predecessor thereof), or of any
affiliated group that files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return (and
any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar state tax group) and of which
the Corporation (or any predecessor thereof) was the parent on or prior to the
Closing Date shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be
carried back to taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

of the other Parties written notice thereof in the manner set forth above.

 

Section 7.2 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that
all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an
executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission shall be
as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.3 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the law of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of laws principles thereof that would mandate the application
of the laws of another jurisdiction.

 

Section 7.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 7.6 _Assignments; Amendments; Successors; No Waiver_.

 

(a) _Assignment_. Each Member may, at any time, assign, sell, alienate,
transfer pledge or hypothecate its interest in this Agreement in whole or in
part, including the right to receive any payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, to any Person, _provided_ , however, that no Member may assign,
sell, pledge, or otherwise alienate or transfer any interest in this
Agreement, including the right to receive any Tax Benefit Payments under this
Agreement, to any Person without such Person executing and delivering a
Joinder agreeing to succeed to the applicable portion of such Members
interest in this Agreement and to become a Party for all purposes of this
Agreement (the " _Joinder Requirement_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Member transfers Units in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement but
does not assign to the transferee of such Units its rights under this
Agreement with respect to such transferred Units, such Member shall continue
to be entitled to receive the Tax Benefit Payments arising in respect of a
subsequent Exchange of such Units. The Corporation may not assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement to any Person without the prior
written consent of the Member Representative (and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be null and void).

 

(b) _Amendments_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such
amendment is approved in writing by the Corporation and the Member
Representative; _provided_ that amendment of the definition of Change of
Control will also require the written approval of a majority of the
Independent Directors.

 

(c) _Successors_. All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the
Parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives. The Corporation shall require and
cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporation, by written agreement, expressly to
assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Corporation would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place.

(d) _Waiver_. No provision of this Agreement may be waived unless such waiver
is in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective. No failure by any Party to insist upon the strict performance of
any covenant, duty, agreement, or condition of this Agreement, or to exercise
any right or remedy consequent upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a
waiver of any such breach or any other covenant, duty, agreement, or
condition.

 



24 Section 7.7 _Titles and Subtitles_. The titles of the sections and subsections
of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be
considered in construing this Agreement.

Section 7.8 _Resolution of Disputes_.

(a) Except for Reconciliation Disputes subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, any
and all disputes which cannot be settled after substantial good-faith
negotiation, including any ancillary claims of any Party, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution,
interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including
the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision) (each a
" _Dispute_ ") shall be finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with
the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Rules for
Non-Administered Arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators, of which the
Corporation shall designate one arbitrator and the Members party to such
Dispute shall designate one arbitrator in accordance with the "screened"
appointment procedure provided in Resolution Rule 5.4. The arbitration shall
be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 _et seq._ , and
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered by any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of the arbitration shall be New
York City, New York.

 



25 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), any Party may bring an
action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of compelling another Party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or
preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an
arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Party (i)
expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this _Section_ __ _
7.8_ to any such action or proceeding, and (ii) agrees that proof shall not be
required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement
would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ shall not apply to
Reconciliation Disputes to be settled in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.9_.

(c) Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within
the meaning of _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, or a Dispute within the meaning of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.8_, shall be decided and resolved as a Dispute subject to
the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.8_.

Section 7.9 _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporation and any Member
are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to a Schedule (other than
an Early Termination Schedule) prepared in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, with respect to an Early Termination
Schedule prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __
_ 4.2_, or with respect to withholding pursuant to _Schedule 7.10_ , within
the relevant time period designated in this Agreement (a "
_Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted
for determination to a nationally recognized expert (the " _Expert_ ") in the
particular area of disagreement mutually acceptable to both Parties. The
Expert shall be a partner or principal in a nationally recognized accounting
firm, and unless the Corporation and such Member agree otherwise, the Expert
shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material
relationship with the Corporation or such Member or other actual or potential
conflict of interest. If the Parties are unable to agree on an Expert within
fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written notice
of a Reconciliation Dispute, the selection of an Expert shall be treated as a
Dispute subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.8_ and an arbitration panel shall pick an
Expert from a nationally recognized accounting firm that does not have any
material relationship with the Corporation or such Member or other actual or
potential conflict of interest. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating
to the Basis Schedule or an amendment thereto, or the Early Termination
Schedule or an amendment thereto within thirty (30) calendar days and shall
resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto
within fifteen (15) calendar days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably
practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to the
Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter
is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement would
be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the
subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the
date prescribed by this Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared
by the Corporation, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The
costs and expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any
Tax Return shall be borne by the Corporation except as provided in the next
sentence. The Corporation and the Member shall bear their own costs and
expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert adopts the Members
position, in which case the Corporation shall reimburse the Member for any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in
such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts the Corporations position, in
which case the Member shall reimburse the Corporation for any reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding. The Expert
shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of
the Expert pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall be binding on the
Corporation and the Member and may be entered and enforced in any court having
competent jurisdiction.

 



26 Section 7.10 _Withholding_. The Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payment that is payable to any Member pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as the Corporation is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code. If the Corporation
becomes aware of any such requirement to so deduct and withhold from any
payment to a Member, the Corporation shall (i) provide such Member with
written notice of the amount of and applicable law requiring such withholding
at least ten (10) calendar days prior to making such deduction and
withholding, (ii) provide the Member with all related tax documentation that
such Member reasonably requests and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain exemptions from, or reductions of, any amounts to be withheld. In
the event that the Corporation and such Member, for any reason, disagree as to
the amount to be withheld and deducted and are unable to resolve such
disagreement at least five (5) calendar days prior to the date on which
the Corporation would so deduct and withhold, the Corporation and the Member
shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporation,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid by the Corporation to the relevant Member. Each Member shall
promptly provide the Corporation with any applicable tax forms and
certifications reasonably requested by the Corporation in connection with
determining whether any such deductions and withholdings are required under
the Code.

 

Section 7.11 _Admission of the Corporation into a Consolidated Group;
Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

 

(a) If the Corporation is or becomes a member of an affiliated, consolidated
or unitary group of corporations that files a consolidated income Tax Return
pursuant to Section 1501 or other applicable Sections of the Code governing
affiliated or consolidated groups, or any similar provisions of U.S. state or
local tax law, then: (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall be
applied with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments,
Early Termination Payments, and other applicable items hereunder shall be
computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the group as a
whole.

 

(b) If any entity that is obligated to make a Tax Benefit Payment or Early
Termination Payment hereunder transfers one or more assets to a corporation
(or a Person classified as a corporation for U.S. income tax purposes) with
which such entity does not file a consolidated Tax Return pursuant to Section
1501 of the Code, such entity, for purposes of calculating the amount of
any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment due hereunder, shall be
treated as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the
date of such contribution. The consideration deemed to be received by such
entity shall be equal to the fair market value of the contributed asset. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, a transfer of a partnership interest
shall be treated as a transfer of the transferring partners share of each of
the assets and liabilities of that partnership.

 



27 Section 7.12 _Confidentiality_. Each Member and its assignees acknowledges and
agrees that the information of the Corporation is confidential and, except in
the course of performing any duties as necessary for the Corporation and its
Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to enforce the terms of
this Agreement, such Person shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence
and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters, acquired pursuant to
this Agreement, of the Corporation and its Affiliates and successors, learned
by any Member heretofore or hereafter, _provided_ that, each Member
acknowledges and agrees that such Member shall, except as otherwise provided
by applicable law, keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not
disclose to any Person that is not a Member any confidential matters
contained in supporting schedules or work papers provided to such Member
pursuant to Section 2.4(a) this Agreement. This _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ shall
not apply to (i) any information that has been made publicly available by the
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a
result of an act of any Member in violation of this Agreement) or is generally
known to the business community, (ii) the disclosure of information to the
extent necessary for a Member to prosecute or defend claims arising under or
relating to this Agreement, and (iii) the disclosure of information to the
extent necessary for a Member to prepare and file its Tax Returns, to respond
to any inquiries regarding the same from any Taxing Authority or to prosecute
or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect
to such Tax Returns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Members and each of their assignees (and each employee, representative or
other agent of the Members or their assignees, as applicable) may disclose at
their discretion to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the
tax treatment and tax structure of the Corporation, the Members and any of
their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions or
other tax analyses) that are provided to the Members relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure. If a Member or an assignee commits a breach, or
threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
7.12_, the Corporation shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions
of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ specifically enforced by injunctive relief or
otherwise by any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any
bond or other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach
or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate
remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 7.13 _Change in Law_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if, in connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a Member
reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause income
(other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this Agreement)
recognized by such Member (or direct or indirect equity holders in such
Member) in connection with any Exchange to be treated as ordinary income
rather than capital gain (or otherwise taxed at ordinary income rates) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes or would have other material adverse tax
consequences to such Member (or any direct or indirect owner of such Member),
then at the written election of such Member in its sole discretion (in an
instrument signed by such Member and delivered to the Corporation) and to the
extent specified therein by such Member, this Agreement shall cease to have
further effect with respect to such Member and shall not apply to an Exchange
with respect to the Units of such Member occurring after a date specified by
such Member, or may be amended in a manner reasonably determined by such
Member, _provided_ that (i) such amendment shall not result in an increase in
any payments owed by the Corporation under this Agreement at any time
as compared to the amounts and times of payments that would have been due in
the absence of such amendment and (ii) the Member Representative consents in
writing to such amendment, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 



28 Section 7.14 _Interest Rate Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the interest paid or agreed to be paid hereunder
with respect to amounts due to any Member hereunder shall not exceed the
maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the "
_Maximum Rate_ "). If any Member shall receive interest in an amount that
exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the Tax
Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment, as applicable (but in each
case exclusive of any component thereof comprising interest) or, if it
exceeds such unpaid non-interest amount, refunded to the Corporation. In
determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by any
Member exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Member may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the payment obligations owed by the Corporation to such
Member hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the
Parties to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws.

Section 7.15  _Independent Nature of Rights and Obligations_. The rights and
obligations of each Member hereunder are several and not joint with the rights
and obligations of any other Person. A Member shall not be responsible in any
way for the performance of the obligations of any other Person hereunder, nor
shall a Member have the right to enforce the rights or obligations of any
other Person hereunder (other than the Corporation). The obligations of a
Member hereunder are solely for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
solely by, the Corporation. Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement
or document delivered at any closing, and no action taken by any Member
pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Members acting
as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity,
or create a presumption that the Members are in any way acting in concert or
as a group with respect to such rights or obligations or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the Corporation acknowledges that the Members are
not acting in concert or as a group and will not assert any such claim with
respect to such rights or obligations or the transactions contemplated hereby.
