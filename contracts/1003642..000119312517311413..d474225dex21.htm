negotiated by Amneal or any of its Subsidiaries. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, either alone or in combination with another event, will not entitle any third party (including any labor
organization or Governmental Authority) to any payments under any of the Amneal Labor Agreements, and each of Amneal and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respect with their obligations pursuant to all notification and bargaining
obligations arising under any Amneal Labor Agreements. Except as has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Amneal Material Adverse Effect, each of Amneal and its Subsidiaries is, and has been since

that are due and payable with respect thereto covering all periods up to and including the Closing Date have been paid, except as have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Amneal Material Adverse

individually or in the aggregate, an Amneal Material Adverse Effect. Since January&nbsp;1, 2012, each of Amneal and its Subsidiaries has been continuously insured with recognized insurers or has self-insured, in each case in such amounts and with
respect to such risks and losses as are required by Law and any Contract to which it is a party and as are customary for companies in the United States conducting the businesses conducted by Amneal and its Subsidiaries, except where such failure has

conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by a director or officer

retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors, and such other personnel as they may deem necessary or appropriate to assist them, and to the fullest extent permitted by law shall be fully protected in
