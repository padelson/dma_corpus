Share Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until

Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration.  No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable

this Article III.

  

### (c) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains

otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Company Paying Agent or the

or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent

holder thereof is entitled.

shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates

Inc. 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _SOP_ ") shall remain in full
force and effect until immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (the "
_SOP Date_ "). As of the SOP Date (i) all amounts held under the SOP shall be
used to purchase Company Common Shares as if the SOP Date were a purchase
date under the SOP and (ii) all offering and purchase periods pending under
the SOP shall be terminated and no new offering or purchasing periods shall
be commenced. Following the date hereof, no new offering or purchase periods
shall be commenced.

  

## Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares, Company
Stock Options and Company Stock-Based Awards, such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or the Company Paying
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable.

following the Companys initial receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal)
of the relevant details relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal (including
the identity of the parties and all material terms thereof) which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or any such officer, trustee, director, employee,
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, broker, finder or other
agent, representative or Affiliate may receive after the date hereof, and
shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis as to the status of and any
material developments regarding any such proposal, including any changes in
material terms or conditions thereto.

  

### (d) Nothing in this Section 7.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company Board from disclosing any information required to be
disclosed under applicable Law or from complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, nothing in this Section 7.03 or this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking any action that any court of
competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take.

  

## Section 7.04 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

  

### (a) From and after the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall honor and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all benefit plans and
compensation arrangements and agreements and employment agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ that nothing herein shall preclude Parent from
amending or terminating any such agreement or arrangement in accordance with
the terms thereof. For a period of one year following the Merger Effective
Time (the " _Benefits Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and its
subsidiaries who remain employed by the Surviving Corporation after
the Merger Effective Time other than such employees covered by
collective bargaining agreements (" _Company Employees_ ") (i) compensation
(including, without limitation, incentive compensation other than equity-
based incentive compensation) no less favorable than the compensation
provided to Company Employees (including without limitation incentive
compensation other than equity-based incentive compensation) immediately
before the Merger Effective Time and (ii) benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided to Company Employees
immediately before the Merger Effective Time. However, nothing in this
Section shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating a
Company Employees employment, or reducing or otherwise modifying any term or
condition of employment, in a manner consistent with the Companys past
practices based upon employee performance, or changes in business
circumstances or conditions. During the Benefits Continuation Period, Parent
shall honor, fulfill and discharge the

        

### 

  

### Companys and the Company Subsidiaries obligations under, the severance
plans listed on Section 7.04(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule without
any amendment or change that is adverse to the Company Employees. During the
Benefits Continuation Period, severance benefits offered to Company Employees
shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the
Merger Effective Time in compensation paid to Company Employees and used to
determine severance benefits.

  

### (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall
subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company
employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time;
_provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the consummation of the Merger (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable plans of the Company or its subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time
and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

  

### (c) All annual bonus plans for Company Employees for fiscal year 2007
will be continued in accordance with their terms, and all annual bonus plans
for Company Employees for fiscal year 2006 will be paid in accordance with
their terms; _provided_  that the bonus plans for fiscal years 2006 and 2007
shall be calculated without taking into account any expenses or costs
associated with or arising as a result of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any expenses or costs related to actions undertaken in
anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or any non-
recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not been anticipated or
occurred,

        

### 

  

### and bonus amounts for the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years shall not be subject
to negative discretion by the administrator for the bonus plans.

  

### (d) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company Board, or an
appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Shares or
Company Stock Options to acquire Company Common Shares (or Company Common
Shares acquired upon the vesting of any Company Stock-Based Awards or Company
Restricted Shares) pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an
exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

  

## Section 7.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of
the Surviving Corporation_.

  

### (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or
this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or
agreements of any of the Company Subsidiaries, from and after the Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to:  (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof
or during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date serving as
a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company
or Company Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in
connection with any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts
paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges
paid or payable in connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines,
penalties or, with the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days
after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified
Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as
now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement
of any bond or other security; _provided_ that all advancement of
expenses pursuant to the foregoing shall be subject to an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to such indemnification. The indemnification and advancement
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
7.05(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Merger
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

        

### 

  

### hereby, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased to be a director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this Section 7.05(a): (A) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or
investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Authority or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith
believes might lead to the institution of any such Action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or
other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such
Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee,
employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing or any other person at or
prior to the Merger Effective Time at the request of the Company or any of
Company Subsidiaries; and (B) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations
(including, without limitation, experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 7.05(a), including any Action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

  

### (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerCo agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees,
agents, or fiduciaries of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as
provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the
charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
identified on Section 7.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
honored by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action,
at the Merger Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

        

### 

  

### (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set
forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective
Time, were directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries
of the Company or any of Company Subsidiaries, unless such modification shall
be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

  

### (d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six
(6) years the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Merger
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) (A) that the Company
may obtain such extended reporting period coverage under the Companys
existing DandO insurance (to be effective as of the Merger Effective Time) or
(B) that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured; _provided_ that
such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring before the Merger Effective Time; (ii) in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section
7.05(d) more than an amount per year of coverage equal to three hundred
percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance. In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend
more than three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by
the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to
three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
successors or assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

  

### (e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

  

### (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.05 and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.05.

### (g) This Section 7.05 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this Section 7.05.

with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to

any Governmental Authority, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly, but in no
event later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof (unless extended by
mutual agreement of the parties) make their respective filings and thereafter
make any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use best efforts
to cooperate with each other in (A) determining whether any filings are
required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or
approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other
Governmental Authorities in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) use best efforts to offer to
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,

(as hereinafter defined) with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as expeditiously possible (and
in any event shall use best efforts to cause the Closing to occur prior to
the Outside Date), including, without limitation (A) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent

        

### decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or
Affiliates or of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise
taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit
the freedom of Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporations) or Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications between the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or
any of their respective subsidiaries, and any third party or any Governmental
Authority with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall
permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party
in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Authority. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone, with any Governmental Authority in connection with the proposed
transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate.

  

### (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 7.06, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), each
of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and
shall use their respective best efforts to contest and resist any such action
or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 7.06 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or 9.01(c) so long as such party has,
prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under this Section
7.06.

  

### (d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the
Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign
statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial
doctrines and other Laws, including without limitation any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i)
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition, (ii) preserve or promote diversity of media ownership or
(iii) protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

## Section 7.07 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Merger shall be issued by a party without the prior

have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and
the execution of this Agreement.

### (f) by the Company or Parent if the Company Shareholder Approval is not
obtained at the Company Shareholders Meeting (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof); _provided_ , however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.01(f) shall not be available to the
Company where the failure to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval is
caused by any action or failure to act of the Company that constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement;

  

### (g) by Parent if the Company Board shall have (1) effected a Company
Change in Recommendation or (2) publicly recommended or approved any Company
Acquisition Proposal; or

  

### (h) by the Company, if the Company Board has approved, or authorized the

has not yet been obtained, (ii) the Company is in compliance in all material
respects with Section 7.03, (iii) the Company shall have first given Parent

entered into, or to which Parent irrevocably covenants to enter into, within
such 2-Business Day period and for which all internal approvals of Parent
have been obtained since receipt of such notice, such Company Superior

account any amendment to this Agreement or any amendment to this Agreement
agreed in writing by Parent), (v) the Company pays to Parent the Termination
Fee in accordance with Section 9.03(b)(i) concurrently with or prior to such
termination, (vi) the Company intends, simultaneously or substantially

such termination to the other parties.

  

## Section 9.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void, and there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part
of any party hereto except that the provisions of Sections 7.02(b), this
Section 9.02, Section 9.03 and Article IX shall survive any
such termination); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as provided
in Section 9.03, nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability
for any breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

  

## Section 9.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

### (a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 9.03, all expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

  

### (b) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated:

  

#### (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g)(2) or the Company pursuant to
Section 9.01(h), the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee; or

  

#### (ii) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or by
Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d), if at or prior to such termination, or in
the case of Section 9.01(f), at or prior to the taking of the vote at the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall have received a bona fide
Company Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that has not been withdrawn
prior to such time and, in the case of Section 9.01(f), such Company
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not publicly
withdrawn prior to such time, (B) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g)(1) or
(C) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(f) after a Company Change in
Recommendation, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
if within twelve (12) months following the Termination Date, the Company
enters into a definitive agreement to consummate or consummates any
Company Acquisition Proposal, with the Termination Fee to be paid upon the
entering into of such definitive agreement or the consummation of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, whichever occurs first (and for purposes of
this Section 9.03(b)(ii), "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in the phrases
dealing with assets and "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in phrases
dealing with equity securities or voting power in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal).

        

#### 

  

### (c) Except as set forth in Section 9.01(h), the Termination Fee shall be
paid by the Company as directed by Parent in writing in immediately available
funds within three (3) Business Days after the date of the event giving rise
to the obligation to make such payment. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Termination Fee_ " means $22,200,000.

  

### (d) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated (i) by Parent

Recommendation, by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(f), the
Company shall reimburse Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses actually incurred by Parent in connection with this Agreement
(including financing fees in connection therewith);  _provided_ that the
Companys aggregate payments and reimbursements pursuant to this Section
9.03(d) shall in no event exceed $5,000,000; _provided_   _further_ that,
notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, any payments
or reimbursements made by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.03(d) shall
reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the Termination Fee payable by the
Company, if any, pursuant to this Section 9.03.

  

### (e) Each of Parent and MergerCo acknowledges and agrees that in the event
that Parent is entitled to receive the Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement, the right of Parent to receive such amount shall constitute each
of the Buyer Parties sole and exclusive remedy for, and such amount shall
constitute liquidated damages in respect of, any termination of this
Agreement regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such termination;
_provided_ that such Termination Fee is paid to Parent. In the event that
the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the Company shall
reimburse Parent for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually
incurred by Parent (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.03. If
payable, none of the Termination Fee shall be payable more than once pursuant
to this Agreement.

  

## Section 9.04 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time,
the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and MergerCo, on the other hand, may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the
other party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other
party or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the Company or Parent (on behalf of Parent and MergerCo).
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement
or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

## Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person
or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  To such end, the
provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

## Section 10.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto by action taken by their respective board of directors (or
similar governing body or entity) at any time prior to the Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, after approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made without further
shareholder approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of the
Nasdaq, requires further approval by such shareholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto.

  

## Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement,
together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedules,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant
to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise).

  

## Section 10.06 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the due,
prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of
the obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of each of the
Buyer Parties under this agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and
undertakings that are required to be performed discharged or complied with
following the Merger Effective Time.

  

## Section 10.07 _Specific Performance_. Subject to Section 9.03(e), the
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach
of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
at law or equity.

  

## Section 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon
any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement, other than

        

## 

  

## following the consummation of the Merger, the provisions of Article II and
Section 7.05 (which are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered
thereby or the persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by
such persons).

  

## Section 10.09 _Governing Law; Forum_.

  

### (a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without
regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

  

### (b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New Jersey or any court
of the United States located in the State of New Jersey (the " _New Jersey
Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation
relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any such litigation in the New Jersey Courts and agrees not to
plead or claim in any New Jersey Court that such litigation brought therein
has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the parties
hereto agrees, (i) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to
service of process in the State of New Jersey, to appoint and maintain an
agent in the State of New Jersey as such partys agent for acceptance of
legal process, and (ii) that service of process may also be made on such
party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by
the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service.
Service made pursuant to (i) or (ii) above shall have the same legal force
and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of New
Jersey.  For purposes of implementing the parties agreement to appoint
and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of New Jersey,
Parent does hereby appoint Lowenstein Sandler PC, at 65 Livingston Avenue,
Roseland, New Jersey 07068 (Attention: Peter H. Ehrenberg) as such agent.

  

## Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of the parties hereto
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this Section 10.10.

  

## Section 10.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        

## 

  

## Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

## Section 10.13 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation,
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

   

57  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, MergerCo, and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
