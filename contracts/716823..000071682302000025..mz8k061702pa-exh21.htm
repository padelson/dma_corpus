STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

   

 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of June 17, 2002 between MILACRON INC., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), and SANDVIK AB, a company organized under the laws of Sweden ("Purchaser").

  

 WHEREAS Purchaser desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell to Purchaser, all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, no par value (the "Shares"), of Valenite Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Seller (the "Acquired Company").

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein the parties hereby agree as follows:

  

ARTICLE I

  

Purchase and Sale of the Shares; Closing; 
 and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment

   

 SECTION 1.01. Purchase and Sale of the Shares. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing (as defined in Section 1.02), (i) Seller shall sell, transfer and deliver to Purchaser or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller at least five business days before the Closing Date (such designee, if any, together with Sandvik AB, shall be the "Purchaser" hereafter in this Agreement), and Purchaser shall purchase from Seller, the Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $175,000,000 (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.04. Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the Purchase Price (less the Non-U.S. Subsidiary Purchase Price (as defined in this Section 1.01)) to Seller on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser at least two business days before the Closing Date. At least 15 business days before the Closing, Purchaser, at its option, may designate one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries as the purchaser of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Company incorporated in a non-U.S. jurisdiction and a separate closing with respect to the transfer of the shares of such subsidiary (which closing shall be solely at Purchaser\'s cost and expense) shall take place on the Closing Date, but prior to the Closing, at an agreed-upon location, which may be in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such subsidiary. In connection with any such separate subsidiary closing, Purchaser shall, at such closing, pay to the Acquired Company or its designee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser an amount equal to the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such non-U.S. subsidiary pursuant to Section 4.07(j)(i) (the aggregate of all such payments in connection with such separate subsidiary closings, collectively the "Non-U.S. Subsidiary Purchase Price"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Closing, Seller shall receive from the Acquired Company or such designee, if any, immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Non-U.S. Subsidiary Purchase Price, reflecting all actual payments made by Purchaser to the Acquired Company or such designee, if any, pursuant to this Section 1.01. The purchase and sale of the Shares is referred to in this Agreement as the "Acquisition".

  

 SECTION 1.02. Closing Date. The closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, at 10:00 a.m. on the first Friday that is a business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, the waiver) of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01, or, if on such day any other condition set forth in Article V has not been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth in Article V have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof), or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed by Seller and Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date". The Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

  

 SECTION 1.03. Transactions To Be Effected at the Closing. At the Closing:

  

 (a) Seller shall deliver to Purchaser (i) certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer tax stamps affixed, (ii) appropriately executed counterparts of the Supply Agreements (as defined in Section 4.17(b)), (iii) an appropriately executed certificate certifying that the Acquisition is exempt from withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A) and (iv) such other documents, instruments or certificates that may be required by this Agreement or as Purchaser and Seller may agree; and

  

 (b) Purchaser shall deliver to Seller (i) in the manner set forth in Section 1.01, immediately available funds in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (less the Non-U.S. Subsidiary Purchase Price previously paid by Purchaser and received by Seller), (ii) appropriately executed counterparts of the Supply Agreements and (iii) such other documents, instruments or certificates that may be required by this Agreement or as Purchaser and Seller may agree.

  

 SECTION 1.04. Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) The Statement. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Statement"), setting forth Net Assets (as defined in Section 1.04(d)) as of the close of business on the Closing Date ("Closing Net Assets") determined in accordance with the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Reference Statement (as defined in Section 2.16), except as provided in Schedule 1.04. After the Closing Date at Seller\'s request, Purchaser shall assist, and shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.05(b)) to assist Seller and its representatives in the preparation of the Statement and shall provide Seller and its representatives any information reasonably requested and shall provide them access at all reasonable times during regular business hours and upon reasonable notice to the management-level personnel, properties, books and records of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for such purpose.

  

 (b) Objections; Resolution of Disputes. (1) Unless Purchaser notifies Seller in writing within 30 days after Seller\'s delivery of the Statement of any objection to any component of the computation of Closing Net Assets set forth therein (the "Notice of Objection"), such computation shall be final and binding. During such 30-day period Purchaser and its representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of Seller relating to the Statement and all other relevant books and records of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries relating to the Statement in Seller\'s possession. Any Notice of Objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein. Any Notice of Objection shall include only objections based on (i) mathematical errors in the computation of Closing Net Assets or (ii) Closing Net Assets not having been calculated in accordance with the consistent application of the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Reference Statement (after taking into consideration the provisions of Schedule 1.04). Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that (i) the sole purpose of the determination of Closing Net Assets is to adjust the Purchase Price so as to reflect the change in Net Assets from December 31, 2001, to the Closing Date and (ii) such change is to be measured on a totally consistent basis so that the calculation is to be done using the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in the preparation of the Reference Statement, except as provided in Schedule 1.04.

  

 (2) If Purchaser provides the Notice of Objection to Seller within such 30-day period, Purchaser and Seller shall, during the 30-day period following Seller\'s receipt of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve Purchaser\'s objections. During such 30-day period, Seller and its representatives shall be permitted to review the working papers of Purchaser and its representatives relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all such objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to an internationally recognized public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller (or, if Purchaser and Seller are unable to so agree within 10 days after the end of such 30-day period, then Purchaser and Seller shall each select within five days after the end of such 10-day period such a firm and such firms shall jointly select a third internationally recognized firm within five days of themselves being selected to resolve the disputed matters (such determining firm being the "Independent Expert")). The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to render its reasoned written decision, which shall be based solely on presentations by Seller and Purchaser and not on an independent review, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 60 days after its selection. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and binding, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller. After final determination of Closing Net Assets, Purchaser shall have no further right to make any claims against Seller in respect of any element of Closing Net Assets that Purchaser raised, or could have raised, in the Notice of Objection.

  

 (c) Adjustment Payment. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Closing Net Assets exceed $103,676,000 (the "Reference Net Assets"), and the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount by which Closing Net Assets are less than the Reference Net Assets (the Purchase Price as so increased or decreased being hereinafter called the "Adjusted Purchase Price"). Within 10 days after Closing Net Assets have been finally determined in accordance with Section 1.04(b), (i) if the Purchase Price is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to LIBOR (as defined in Section 9.05(b)), calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment, and (ii) if the Purchase Price is greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to such difference, together with interest thereon at a rate equal to LIBOR, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed divided by 365, from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Any such payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be.

  

 (d) Net Assets. The term "Net Assets" means Total Assets minus Total Liabilities.

For purposes of the preparation of the Statement, Total Assets and Total Liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies shall be translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates for the applicable foreign currencies as of December 20, 2001, as reported in The Wall Street Journal, Northeastern edition.

The Seller 401(k) Plan has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to "TRA" (as defined in Section 1 of Rev. Proc. 91-66 or 93-39), to the effect that the Seller 401(k) Plan is qualified, and its related trust is exempt from Federal Income Taxes, under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and such determination letter has not been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Seller, has revocation been threatened, nor has the Seller 401(k) Plan been amended since the date of its determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification. There is no suit, action or claim (other than routine claims for benefits) pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened relating to the Seller 401(k) Plan or the Seller Cafeteria Plan that would be reasonably likely to result in a material liability to Purchaser.

  

 (c) None of Seller or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries), or to the knowledge of Seller, any officer of Seller or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries) or any Seller Benefit Plans (including Pension Plans) which are subject to ERISA, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could be expected to subject the Acquired Company, any of its subsidiaries or any officer of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

 (f) With respect to any Seller Benefit Plan maintained outside of the United States, there are no material obligations or liabilities with respect thereof that would reasonably be expected to become a liability of Purchaser on or after the Closing Date.

Seller shall cause to be kept all insurance policies currently maintained by the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries with respect to themselves and their respective assets and properties (the "Acquired Company Insurance Policies" and, together with the Seller Insurance Policies, the "Insurance Policies"), or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date.

 (c) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to maintain levels of inventory reasonably consistent with the business requirements of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, giving due consideration to the current and foreseeable economic conditions.

 SECTION 4.02. Access to Information. Seller shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to afford to Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing, to the personnel, properties, books, Contracts, commitments and records of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries.

  

 SECTION 4.03. Confidentiality. Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection with the Acquisition and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement between Purchaser and Seller (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries; provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and all other information provided to it by Seller or its representatives concerning Seller or any of its subsidiaries (other than the Acquired Company and any of its subsidiaries) shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

  

 SECTION 4.04. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including taking all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its affiliates with respect to the Closing. Seller and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective affiliates to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in Article V not being satisfied.

  

 (b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than ten days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United  States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated hereby. Any such notification and report form shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall furnish to the other such necessary information  and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and  the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request and shall promptly provide any supplemental information requested in connection with the filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party  shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall also cooperate to make any required filings outside the United States as promptly as practicable following the execution and  delivery of this Agreement, and shall each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance or approval required under the competition laws or regulations of any foreign jurisdictions for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 4.04, the "reasonable best  efforts" of Purchaser shall not include entering into a consent decree containing Purchaser\'s agreement to hold separate and/or divest and/or license the products and assets of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries or Purchaser or its affiliates, as the case may be, as may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or any  other Governmental Entity.

  

 (c) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to Contracts to which the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company is a party and that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents and waivers from third parties to the Acquired Company Contracts and Purchaser agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to Seller to obtain such consents and waivers; provided, however, that neither party shall be required to expend money, commence, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any such third party, except that Seller shall pay the fees and expenses of outside counsel to the holder of the Gainesville Bonds (as defined in Schedule 2.04) for any tax or other legal opinions that may be necessary in connection with the consent required under the Gainesville Bonds as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall arrange for the assumption by the Acquired Company of all obligations of Seller and its subsidiaries with respect to the vehicles in Seller\'s corporate vehicle fleet leased pursuant to the Agreement of Lease (No. 1141) dated as of January 1, 1981, as amended, with PHH Vehicle Management Services Corporation ("PHH") that are assigned to the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, and, if required by PHH as a condition to such assumption, Purchaser or one of its affiliates, as the case may be, shall enter into one or more agreements with PHH or its affiliates in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller providing for the guarantee by Purchaser of such assumption by the Acquired Company.

  

 (d) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to assist Purchaser in its effort to transition the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries from payroll and information technology services currently provided by Seller to the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to substantially similar services to be provided by Purchaser and its subsidiaries immediately after the Closing Date. Each party hereto shall be responsible for the payment of its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the actions contemplated by this Section 4.04(d).

  

 SECTION 4.05. Brokers or Finders. Each of Purchaser and Seller represents, as to itself and its affiliates, that no agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person is or will be entitled to any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except, as to Seller, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Seller and, as to Purchaser and its affiliates, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., whose fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser.

  

 SECTION 4.06. Employee Matters. (a) Credited Service. At Closing, the only employees of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be the Affected Employees. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall give the Affected Employees full credit for all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate, early retirement eligibility, early retirement subsidies, vesting and benefit accrual) under all employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Purchaser and its subsidiaries that are made available by Purchaser to the Affected Employees, for the Affected Employees\' service with Seller and its subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by Seller and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, that Purchaser and its subsidiaries shall not be obligated to provide credit for such service for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan or premium subsidy under any retiree medical plan of Purchaser and its subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Affected Employee" means each individual who is employed by the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company on the Closing Date, including any such individuals on approved leave of absence (including maternity and paternity leave, vacation, sick leave, short-term disability, military leave, jury duty and death leave, but excluding long-term disability); provided, however, that an individual on a long-term disability leave of absence from the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries on the Closing Date shall become an Affected Employee upon his or her return to active employment if such return to active employment occurs within 90 days after the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company or one of its subsidiaries to offer employment to the individual set forth in Schedule 4.06(a) (the "Designated Employee"), which offer shall be on terms and conditions in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4.06 as if such individual had been an employee of the Acquired Company immediately prior to the Closing. The current salary and bonus provided to the Designated Employee are set forth in Schedule 4.06(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, provided that the Designated Employee accepts Purchaser\'s offer of employment, the Designated Employee shall be treated as of the Closing as an Affected Employee for all purposes under this Agreement.

  

 (b) Continuation of Benefits. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 4.06, for the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, provide (i) each Affected Employee with salary and bonus opportunities that are no less favorable to such Affected Employee than those in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) Affected Employees with employee benefit plans and arrangements (other than salary and bonus opportunities) which are, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Section 4.06, in the aggregate comparable to those provided to Purchaser\'s similarly situated employees, including the plans and programs described in Schedule 4.06(b) as in effect on the date hereof; provided that Purchaser shall cause the short-term disability benefits, vacation programs and fringe benefit programs in effect for Affected Employees as of the Closing Date to remain in effect without any changes adverse to the Affected Employees at least until December 31, 2002. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be solely responsible for any payment pursuant to the stay-around bonus arrangements set forth in Schedule 2.06 or contemplated by Schedule 4.01 and nothing contained therein shall be deemed to supersede the obligations, liabilities or commitments of Purchaser hereunder. 

  

 (c) Severance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to provide each Affected Employee whose employment is terminated by Purchaser or its subsidiaries during the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date with severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided to such Affected Employee under the severance benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements of Seller and its subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (other than any special severance contained in the stay-around bonus arrangements set forth in Schedule 2.06 or contemplated by Schedule 4.01), true and complete copies of which have been delivered or made available to Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.06(a) and 2.14(a).

  

 (d) Tax-Qualified Savings/401(k) Plan. (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have in effect one or more defined contribution plans that include a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (as applicable, a "Purchaser 401(k) Plan") that will provide benefits to Affected Employees. Each Purchaser 401(k) Plan shall be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust which is a part of such plan shall be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each Affected Employee who is eligible to participate in the Milacron Retirement Savings Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") as of the Closing Date shall be eligible to participate in a Purchaser 401(k) Plan as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date.

  

 (ii) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Affected Employee who is eligible to participate in a Seller 401(k) Plan shall cease to participate in such Seller 401(k) Plan, and shall be fully vested, to the extent not already vested, in his or her account, if any, under Seller 401(k) Plan. As of the Closing Date or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, Seller shall contribute to the Seller 401(k) Plan for the benefit of the Affected Employees (i) all contributions due with respect to the last plan year ending prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all employer and employee contributions for the plan year including the Closing Date to which the Affected Employees are entitled with respect to compensation earned by the Affected Employees as of the Closing Date. As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall make distributions from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Affected Employees, as permitted under Section 401(k)(10) of the Code and as elected by the Affected Employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Affected Employee may elect to effect, and Purchaser agrees to cause a Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept, a "direct rollover" to such Purchaser 401(k) Plan of such Affected Employee\'s account balances in the Seller 401(k) Plan (including any promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans, which loans shall, to the extent permissible under such Seller 401(k) Plan, be assumed by such Purchaser 401(k) Plan and to such extent shall not be deemed to be in default under the Seller 401(k) Plan).

  

 (e) Certain Welfare Benefits Matters. (i) Purchaser shall (A) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare benefit plans of Purchaser and its subsidiaries ("Purchaser Welfare Plans") in which the Affected Employees and their dependents may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date to the extent waived under the applicable corresponding Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid under the applicable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if later, in the calendar year in which Affected Employees and their dependents commence participation in the applicable Purchaser Welfare Plan) for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Purchaser Welfare Plans in which the Affected Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing Date. Within 60 days after the Closing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser, or cause a third-party administrator or insurer to provide to Purchaser, all data reasonably requested by Purchaser to facilitate the actions described in the previous sentence.

  

 (ii) Seller shall be solely responsible, in accordance with the terms of the Seller Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, for all liabilities under the Seller Benefit Plans, including all liabilities in respect of medical, dental, life insurance and other welfare benefit claims incurred by Affected Employees and their eligible dependents prior to the Closing Date under the Seller Benefit Plans. Purchaser shall be solely responsible, in accordance with the terms of all applicable welfare plans of Purchaser and its subsidiaries for all medical, dental, life insurance and other welfare benefit claims incurred by Affected Employees and their eligible dependents on or after the Closing Date (or, if later, when such individual becomes an Affected Employee) (including short-term disability benefits in respect of individuals who became disabled on or prior to the Closing Date). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume all liabilities and obligations to Affected Employees and their eligible dependents in respect of health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and applicable state law for qualifying events occurring on or after the Closing Date; provided, that Seller and its subsidiaries shall remain obligated to provide any applicable COBRA notices and continuation coverage in respect of qualifying events occurring prior to the Closing Date, and any required certificates of creditable coverage in accordance with HIPAA under the Seller Benefit Plans.

  

 (f) Cafeteria Plan. Purchaser shall have in effect as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (a "Purchaser Cafeteria Plan")  that provide benefits to Affected Employees who participated in the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the cafeteria plan in which Affected Employees participate prior to the Closing ("Seller Cafeteria Plan") and Purchaser agrees to cause a Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to accept a transfer of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts of the Affected  Employees from the Seller Cafeteria Plan and to honor and continue through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Affected Employee under the Seller Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided that confirmation of such  elections has been provided by Seller to Purchaser. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be transferred from the Seller Cafeteria Plan to a Purchaser Cafeteria Plan the excess of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by Affected  Employees over the aggregate claims submitted prior to the Closing Date for such year with respect to such accounts by the Affected Employees. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims against the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made by Affected Employees under the Seller Cafeteria Plan, whether incurred  prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not been submitted to Seller for payment prior to the Closing Date, and following the Closing Date Purchaser shall hold Seller and its subsidiaries harmless from any and all claims for reimbursement under the Seller Cafeteria Plan that are not submitted to Seller for payment prior to the Closing Date.

  

 (g) Administration. Following the date of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in all matters reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 4.06, including, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, exchanging information and data relating to workers compensation, employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverages, and in obtaining any governmental approvals required hereunder.

  

 (h) Workers\' Compensation. Seller shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits which are incurred prior to the Closing Date by Affected Employees that are payable under the terms and conditions of Seller\'s and its subsidiaries\' (including the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries) workers compensation programs. Purchaser\'s workers compensation programs shall be responsible for all claims for benefits which are incurred from and after the Closing Date by Affected Employees that are payable under the terms and conditions of Purchaser\'s workers compensation programs. For purposes of this Section 4.06(h), a claim for workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the claim occurs (each, a "Workers\' Compensation Event"). If a Workers\' Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following the Closing, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and liability of Seller and Purchaser and shall be equitably apportioned between Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based upon the relevant periods of time that such Workers\' Compensation Event transpired preceding and following the Closing. 

  

 SECTION 4.07. Tax Matters. (a) Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns. (i) As to all Tax Returns of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries due on or before the Closing Date and all Income Tax Returns which the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries files on a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar basis for which the relevant group includes Seller or any entity affiliated with Seller other than the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, Seller shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice and shall timely pay (or cause to be paid) Taxes shown as due thereon.

  

 (ii) As to Income Tax Returns (other than Income Tax Returns referred to in Section 4.07(a)(i)) of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries due after the Closing Date for tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare in a manner consistent with past practice, unless there is no reasonable basis under Applicable Law for taking the positions reflected on returns prepared in such manner, and Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to timely file such Income Tax Returns. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the amount shown to be due on the final version of any such Income Tax Return prior to the filing thereof.

  

 (iii) As to non-Income Tax Returns of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for any non-Income Taxes due after the Closing Date for tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired company and its subsidiaries to prepare and file such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past practice, unless there is no reasonable basis under Applicable Law for taking the positions reflected on returns prepared in such manner; provided, however, that (1) Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller at least 15 business days before it is due, (2) Seller shall have sole discretion to approve or modify such Tax Return by notice at least 5 business days before such Tax Return is due and any such modification must have a reasonable basis under Applicable Law, (3) such Tax Return shall be filed (as so approved or modified) on a timely basis by the Acquired Company or its subsidiaries, as applicable, and (4) Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the amount for which Seller has an obligation to indemnify under Section 7.02(iv) shown to be due on the final version of any such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof. If, however, Purchaser would be responsible for any payment of non-Income Taxes due after the Closing Date for periods ending on or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to prepare and file the Tax Returns on which such Taxes are reflected in a manner consistent with past practice, unless there is no reasonable basis under Applicable Law for taking the positions reflected on returns prepared in such manner; provided, however, that (1) Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller at least 15 business days before it is due, (2) Seller shall have the right to examine and comment on any such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof, and such Tax Return will not be filed without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (3) Seller shall either provide such written consent or notice of objection no later than 5 business days before such Tax Return is due, and (4) such Tax Return shall be filed on a timely basis by the Acquired Company or its subsidiaries, as applicable.

  

 (iv) Any dispute between the parties under this Section 4.07(a) shall be resolved by the Independent Expert under the principles of Section 1.04(b)(2), except that every effort shall be made by the parties and the Independent Expert to resolve the dispute prior to the due date for the applicable Tax Return.

  

 (b) Straddle Period Tax Returns. (i) As to any Tax Return of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for a tax period that begins on or before and ends after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, as applicable, to prepare and timely file such Return and pay all Taxes due with respect thereto; provided, however, that Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any amount owed by Seller with respect to such Tax Return in accordance with Section 7.01. or Section 7.02. If any such Tax Return shall solely report Taxes for which Seller has an obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, the proviso contained in the first sentence of Section 4.07(a)(iii) shall apply to such Tax Return. If any such Tax Return shall report any Taxes for which Seller does not have any such obligation, the proviso contained in the second sentence of Section 4.07(a)(iii) shall apply to such Tax Return.

  

 (ii) All Tax Returns for any tax period that includes the Closing Date shall be filed on the basis that the relevant tax period ended as of the end of the Closing Date (and thus that Section 4.07(b)(i) does not apply), unless such a Tax Return would be clearly contrary to Applicable Law.

  

 (iii) Taxes for which a Straddle Period Tax Return is required to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 4.07 shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and Post-Closing Tax Period (a) in the case of real and personal property and similar Taxes, ratably on a daily basis (taking into account the period during which the property was held in cases in which the amount of such Taxes depends upon the period during which the property was held), and (b) in the case of other Taxes, on the basis of actual operations, on a closing of the books method.

  

 (iv) Any dispute between the parties under this Section 4.07(b) shall be resolved by the Independent Expert under the principles of Section 1.04(b)(2), except that every effort shall be made by the parties and the Independent Expert to resolve the dispute prior to the due date for the applicable Tax Return.

  

 (c) Transfer Tax Returns. Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, each shall pay 50% of all Transfer Taxes; provided, however, that each of Seller, the Acquired Company and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such exemptions. Seller shall pay all sales (including bulk sales), use, value-added, transfer, recording, ad valorem, privilege, documentary, gross-receipts, registration, conveyance, excise, license, stamp or similar Taxes and fees arising out of, in connection with or attributable to the transactions contemplated by Section 4.18.

  

 (d) Amended Tax Returns. After the Closing Date, the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries shall not file any amended Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, except that the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries may request the written consent of Seller to amend such Tax Returns solely to carryback losses or credits, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

 (e) Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Seller and its affiliates will need access, from time to time after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company to, (i) use its reasonable best efforts to properly retain and maintain such records for a period of six years following the Closing Date, and (ii) allow Seller and its agents and representatives (and agents or representatives of any of its affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as Seller may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at Seller\'s expense. If Seller provides a written request prior to the destruction of records referred to in this Section that such records should be retained beyond the six-year period specified above, Purchaser shall maintain such records for a reasonable additional period (not to exceed two years) specified by Seller, and Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for any costs associated with such retention.

  

 (f) Refunds and Credits. Any refund or credit of Income Taxes of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than refunds or credits that arise from a carryback of losses or credits generated during a Post-Closing Period, which shall be for the account of Purchaser) shall be for the account of Seller. Any refund or credit of Income Taxes of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller\'s expense, cause the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries to file for and obtain any refunds or credits for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to which Seller is entitled under this Section 4.07(f); provided, however, that Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees (as defined in Section 7.01(a)) for any Taxes arising out of, connected with or related to obtaining such refunds or credits for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Purchaser and the Acquired Company shall permit Seller to control the prosecution of any such refund claim for Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If Seller pays (or causes the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries to pay prior to the Closing Date) estimated Income Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of the amount ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and Purchaser obtains the benefit of such excess payment, Purchaser shall promptly refund such excess to Seller. Purchaser shall be entitled to all refunds of Taxes which Purchaser pays pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iv) and Seller shall provide such assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with obtaining any such refund. Purchaser shall be responsible for all expenses (other than a reversal of Tax benefits arising as a result of such Taxes having previously been paid) reasonably incurred by Seller in providing such assistance.

  

 (g) Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller shall cause the provisions of any Tax sharing agreement (or any equivalent thereof, including profit and loss sharing agreements) between Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Acquired Company and any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing), and the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, neither Purchaser nor the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing agreement, excluding any Tax sharing agreement between only the Acquired Company (or any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing) and any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing.

  

 (h) Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as currently conducted and on the Closing Date shall not permit the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries to effect any extraordinary transactions (other than any such transactions expressly required by Applicable Law or by this Agreement including, for the avoidance of doubt, the tax elections described in Section 4.07(i) and any purchase of Subsidiary Shares by one or more of Purchaser\'s direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries) that could result in (a) any additional Tax liability to Seller or any of its affiliates or any indemnification obligation of Seller for the payment of Taxes under Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.02 or (b) any Tax liability to the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries in excess of Tax liability associated with the conduct of its business in the ordinary course. 

  

 (i) Section 338 Elections. Purchaser and Seller shall (i) join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations") and any comparable election under state or local Tax law with respect to the Acquired Company, Valenite Manufacturing Inc. and Valenite U.S.A. Inc. (the "Elections"), (ii) provide to the other the necessary information to permit the Elections to be made (iii) as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, take all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing any necessary forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents) as may be required to effect and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations (or any comparable provisions of state or local Tax law)) and (iv) Purchaser may, but shall not be required to, make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to Valenite-Modco Limited, Valenite De Mexico, S.A. De C.V., Valenite-Widia Japan Inc. and Valenite-Modco Commercial Ltda.

  

 (j) Purchase Price Allocations. (i) Within 10 calendar days following the date of this Agreement, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of a portion of the Purchase Price to each direct or indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Company incorporated in a non-U.S. jurisdiction. Purchaser shall then have 10 calendar days to review such proposed allocations and provide Seller with notice of any disputes with respect to such allocations. If Purchaser disputes any of such allocations, Seller and Purchaser will attempt in good faith to promptly agree on allocations. If the parties cannot resolve any such dispute within 20 calendar days of the delivery of such allocations, the items in dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Expert. If the Independent Expert determines that Seller\'s position is materially incorrect, then Seller and Purchaser shall be bound by the allocation as determined by the Independent Expert. The Independent Expert shall make any such determination by the earlier of (A) 20 calendar days following the submission of the disputed items and (B) 3 business days prior to the Closing Date. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller. The allocation determined by this Section 4.07(j)(i) for a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Company incorporated in a non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be the purchase price for the shares of such subsidiary if such shares are purchased at a separate closing pursuant to Section 1.01.

  

 (ii) Within 15 calendar days following the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed allocation of the Purchase Price, less any amounts allocated pursuant to Section 4.07(j)(i) above and including liabilities treated as assumed, among the assets of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries incorporated in the United States (other than shares of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Company incorporated in a non-U.S. jurisdiction). If Purchaser disputes any of such allocations, Seller and Purchaser will attempt in good faith to promptly agree on allocations. If the parties cannot resolve any such dispute within 60 calendar days of the delivery of such allocations, the items in dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Expert. If the Independent Expert determines that Seller\'s position is materially incorrect, then Seller and Purchaser shall be bound by the allocation as determined by the Independent Expert. The Independent Expert shall make any such determination within 30 calendar days following the submission of the disputed items. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne 50% by Purchaser and 50% by Seller. Within 60 calendar days of a final determination of an allocation of the complete Purchase Price, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a completed IRS Form 8023 and the required schedules thereto ("Form 8023"), providing for each election to be made under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations. Amounts allocated on the Form 8023 will not include the purchase price for any shares of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the Acquired Company incorporated in a non-U.S. jurisdiction purchased at a separate closing pursuant to Section 1.01.

  

 (iii) Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries arising as a result of the transfers set forth in Schedule 4.18 (the "Special Taxes"). To the extent any Special Taxes are not due and payable until after the Closing, Seller shall leave cash in the Acquired Company or one of its subsidiaries in an amount necessary to pay such Taxes and designate such cash for such purpose in a written notice provided by Seller to Purchaser at the Closing (the amount of such cash, the "Designated Amount"). Purchaser shall at Seller\'s expense cause the Acquired Company or such subsidiary to pay such Taxes and comply with applicable reporting rules. Seller shall make an additional payment to Purchaser to the extent that (x) the Designated Amount is less than (y) the amount of the Special Taxes. Purchaser shall refund to Seller an amount equal to any excess of (x) the Designated Amount over (y) the amount of the Special Taxes.

  

 (iv) Purchaser and Seller agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the elections, allocations and forms described in this Section 4.07, except as otherwise required by a Taxing Authority or as may be required to reflect amounts treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Purchaser and Seller further agree not to take any position inconsistent therewith for any Tax purpose, except as otherwise required by a Taxing Authority. The parties agree that a violation of the provisions of this Section 4.07 is a proper subject of injunctive relief.

  

 SECTION 4.08. Publicity. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the transactions contemplated in Schedule 4.18) shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party an amount of time reasonable under the circumstances to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance; provided, however, that each of the parties may make internal announcements to their respective employees that are consistent with the parties\' prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 SECTION 4.09. Resignations. On the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be delivered to Purchaser duly signed resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of all directors or members of other similar governing body of their position as a director or such other member (and, if requested by Purchaser in writing at least 10 business days prior to Closing, of officers of their position as an officer) of the Acquired Company and each of its subsidiaries and shall take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing; provided, however, that no such resignation by any individual shall be a resignation from employment with the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company if such individual is so employed.

  

 SECTION 4.10. No Use of Certain Names. Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company promptly, and in any event (a) within 90 days after the Closing, to revise print advertising and product labeling to delete all references to the Names (as defined below), except to the extent such use is permitted under the License Agreement dated as of April 29, 2002, between the Acquired Company, on the one hand, and Widia GmbH, Widia Nederland B.V., Milacron Iberica S.L., Milacron U.K. Ltd., Milacron France SAS and Widia Italia S.r.l., on the other hand (the "License Agreement") and (b) within 60 days after the Closing, to change Internet domain names and websites, signage and stationery to the extent necessary to discontinue use of the Names for all corporate identification purposes. Purchaser agrees that it will not order any new print advertising, product labeling, signage or stationery, or create any new information or other materials, which uses the Names after the Closing, except with respect to the use of the Names permitted under the License Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the License Agreement, in no event shall Purchaser, the Acquired Company or their respective subsidiaries use any Names after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such Names by the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, as the case may be, during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. Within 30 days after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company to file applications to amend or terminate any certificate of assumed name or d/b/a or foreign filings so as to eliminate the right of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries to use the Names for corporate identification purposes. Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the names of the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company (in each case, to the extent they make use of the Names) to be changed to names (that do not include the Names) selected by Purchaser. "Names" means "Milacron", "Widia", "Werko", "Cimcool", "Milpro", "Widacool" or any name, logo or trademark that includes "Milacron", "Widia", "Werko", "Cimcool", "Milpro" or "Widacool", any variations and derivatives thereof and any other logos or trademarks of Seller or its affiliates not included in Schedule 2.09.

  

 SECTION 4.11. No Further Financial Obligations. Purchaser acknowledges that in the course of conduct by the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries of their respective businesses, Seller and its affiliates (collectively, but excluding the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries, the "Seller Entities") entered into various arrangements (i) in which guarantees were issued by the Seller Entities or (ii) in which the Seller Entities are the primary obligors on other agreements, in any such case solely to support or facilitate business transactions or programs of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries. The financing or other arrangements referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are hereinafter referred to as the "Guarantees", including those set forth in Schedule 4.11 which, to the knowledge of Seller, is a complete list of Guarantees. It is understood that the Guarantees shall not continue after the Closing. Purchaser agrees that Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain replacement Guarantees which will be in effect at the Closing or, in the case of Guarantees described in the foregoing clause (ii), will either terminate the business transactions or programs of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries supported or facilitated by such Guarantees or arrange for itself or one of its subsidiaries to be substituted as the primary obligor thereon as of the Closing Date. In the event that Purchaser is unable to satisfy the terms of the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser and its affiliates shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Entities from and against any and all Losses (as defined in Section 7.02) incurred by the Seller Entities relating to the Guarantees.

  

 SECTION 4.12. Support Services. Purchaser acknowledges that as of the Closing Date, Seller shall have no obligation to provide any support or other services to the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries (including any of the services for which allocations were previously paid by the Acquired Company).

  

 SECTION 4.13. Post-Closing Information. Following the Closing, upon reasonable written notice to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Company and each subsidiary of the Acquired Company to, afford to Seller and its affiliates reasonable access to the personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for any reasonable business purpose, including in respect of litigation, insurance matters and financial reporting of Seller and its affiliates.

  

 SECTION 4.14. Litigation Matters. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into arrangements such that on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser or the Acquired Company shall assume full responsibility for (i) the prosecution,  defense and/or settlement and all other aspects of the administration of any suit, action, proceeding or arbitration by or against the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company (including the matters set forth in Schedule 2.13 (other than the  matters set forth in Schedule 2.13 that are also set forth in Schedule 4.14(b)), Schedule 2.15(b) and Schedule 2.19(b), but excluding the matters set forth in Schedule 4.14(b)) (collectively, the "Actions") and (ii) the timely payment of any and all losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses related to or arising out of the Actions. After the Closing, Seller shall (x) promptly deliver to Purchaser (or the  Acquired Company if so requested) the case files relating to the Actions and (y) provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with the assumption by Purchaser of the Actions contemplated by this Section 4.14(a). Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs of investigation) incurred in assisting Purchaser pursuant to  this Section 4.14(a). Seller shall not be required by this Section 4.14(a) to take any action that would interfere with the conduct of its business or disrupt its normal operations. In the event that Seller or one of its affiliates (other than the Acquired Company and any of its subsidiaries) is a party to any Action, Seller may, at its own cost and expense, continue to control the prosecution, defense and/or  settlement and all other aspects of the administration of that portion of such Action that relates to or affects Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Acquired Company and any of its subsidiaries). For the avoidance of doubt, (i) as of the Closing Seller, as the Indemnifying Party, shall assume the defense of the matters set forth in Schedule 2.15(b) in accordance with Section 7.04 and (ii) nothing  contained in this Section 4.14(a) shall be deemed to limit or supercede the obligations of Seller with respect to Offsite Environmental Losses under Section 7.02.

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller, Purchaser and the Acquired Company shall enter into arrangements such that on and after the Closing Date, Seller shall assume full responsibility for (i) the prosecution, defense and/or settlement and all other aspects of the administration of the matters set forth in Schedule 4.14(b) (collectively, the "Retained Actions") and (ii) the timely payment of any and all losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses related to or arising out of the Retained Actions. After the Closing, Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries) will reasonably cooperate and assist Seller in connection with the Retained Actions. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing upon reasonable notice reasonable access to properties of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries and copies of information, records and documents relating to the Retained Actions, using commercially reasonable efforts to make available employees to assist in connection with the Retained Actions and providing other assistance, where commercially reasonable, with respect to the Retained Actions; provided, that such assistance and cooperation does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs of investigation) incurred in assisting Seller pursuant to this Section 4.14(b).

  

 SECTION 4.15. Covenants relating to Stock Pledge Agreement, Security Agreement, Receivables Facility and MSF Bonds. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall have caused to be (a) released (i) all Liens in and upon the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares  pursuant to the Stock Pledge Agreement dated as of October 15, 2001, as amended, between Milacron Inc. and Bankers Trust Company, as administrative agent (the "Stock Pledge Agreement") and (ii) all Liens in and upon the assets of the Acquired Company and  its subsidiaries pursuant to the Security Agreement dated as of October 25, 2001, as amended, between Milacron Inc., certain of its subsidiaries and Bankers Trust Company, as administrative agent (the "Security Agreement") and (b) terminated as of the Closing Date (i) all obligations of the Acquired Company under (A) the Amended and Restated Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of March 18, 1994, as amended, among Cincinnati Milacron Marketing Company, Valenite  Inc. and Cincinnati Milacron Commercial Corp. and (B) the Third Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement dated as of November 15, 2001, as amended, among Milacron Inc., Talbot Holdings, Ltd., Milacron Marketing Company, Market Street Funding Corporation and PNC Bank, National Association (the agreements specified in clauses (i)(A) and (B) are collectively referred to as the "Receivables Facility") and (ii) all interests in the Receivables and the Related  Assets (each as defined in the Receivables Facility) of the Acquired Company created pursuant to the Receivables Facility.

 SECTION 7.01. Tax Indemnification. (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.05, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser and its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the "Purchaser Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Income Taxes of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all liability as a result of Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6(a) (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law) for Income Taxes resulting from the Acquired Company or one of its subsidiaries being a member of a consolidated group on or before the Closing Date, (iii) all liability for Taxes arising from any Tax sharing agreement that is required to have been terminated pursuant to Section 4.07(g), excluding any Tax sharing agreement between only the Acquired Company (or any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing) and any of its subsidiaries as of the Closing, or other contractual agreement to which the Acquired Company or one of its subsidiaries was a party prior to the Closing Date, (iv) all liability of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for Taxes of any other person as transferee or successor or by contract or otherwise, (v) all liability for Taxes arising as a result of (A) the Section 338(h)(10) elections and any comparable elections made under state or local Tax law described in Section 4.07 (i) or (B) any restructuring, reorganization, divestiture, merger or acquisition undertaken by Seller, the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries, on or prior to the Closing Date, in contemplation of the transactions described in this Agreement, including the transactions contemplated in Schedule 4.18 and (vi) all liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses, interest, penalties and additions to Tax attributable to any item in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above.

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and representatives (the "Seller Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from (i) all liability of Seller following the Closing Date for Taxes other than Income Taxes of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries for all taxable periods whether ending before, on or after the Closing Date, except to the extent provided in Section 7.02, and for Income Taxes for any Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) all liability of Seller for Taxes attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act or to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement, (iii) all liability for Taxes arising as a result of the Section 338(g) elections made pursuant to Section 4.07(i), (iv) all liability for Taxes arising as a result of the separate closings for subsidiaries of the Acquired Company incorporated in non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to Section 1.01 that would not have arisen as a result of the transactions provided for in this Agreement but for such separate closings and (v) all liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above.

  

 (c) Taxes for Straddle Periods shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in accordance with the principles of Section 4.07(b)(ii).

  

 (d) Responsibility for Taxes arising as a result of the separate closings for subsidiaries of the Acquired Company incorporated in non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to Section 1.01 that would have arisen as a result of the transactions provided for in this Agreement even in the absence of such separate closings shall be allocated between Purchaser and Seller under Sections 7.01, 7.02 and 4.07(c) hereof as though such separate closings had not occurred.

  

 SECTION 7.02. Other Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.05 or Section 7.06, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or expenses, including (x) reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel and (y) to the extent required to comply with Environmental Laws or by any Governmental Entity pursuant to Environmental Laws, reasonable fees and expenses of outside environmental consultants, and costs of sampling, testing, investigation, removal, treatment and remediation of contamination (collectively, "Losses") (other than any Loss relating to Taxes to the extent that indemnification payments for such Loss have been made pursuant to Section 7.01), to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

  

 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(a); 

  

 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Seller contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(b);

  

 (iii) any fees, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by Seller to any agent, broker, investment banker or other firm or person retained or employed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iv) any Taxes (other than Income Taxes) of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, but only to the extent such Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period exceed the aggregate amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shown on the Statement;

  

 (v) the Receivables Facility;

  

 (vi) any Seller Benefit Plan except to the extent expressly assumed by Purchaser under Section 4.06;

  

 (vii) the offsite disposal, treatment or storage (or arrangement for such disposal, treatment or storage) of any Hazardous Substances by or in connection with the operation of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries prior to Closing, including to the extent arising or resulting from the offsite locations described in Schedule 2.15(b) ("Offsite Environmental Losses"); and

  

 (viii) the Excluded Liabilities (as defined in Section 9.05(b));

  

 provided, however, that clause (i) shall apply to any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in Section 2.12(f) without regard to the materiality qualification contained in such representation or warranty.

  

 SECTION 7.03. Other Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses (other than any Loss relating to Taxes, for which indemnification provisions are set forth in Section 7.01), to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

  

 (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(a);

  

 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.03(b);

  

 (iii) any guarantee or obligation to assure performance given or made by Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries) with respect to any obligation of the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries; 

  

 (iv) all obligations, liabilities and commitments of whatever kind and nature, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, express, implied, liquidated, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, whether or not accrued, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, of the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company, including any such obligations or liabilities relating to (x) any Acquired Company Contract or any agreement, lease, license, permit, plan or commitment that, because it fails to meet the relevant threshold amount or term, is not included within the definition of Acquired Company Contracts, (y) any Acquired Company Benefit Plan or (z) any Action, except, in any such case, to the extent Seller is required to provide indemnification for such obligations, liabilities and commitments under Section 7.02; 

  

 (v) any discontinuance, suspension or modification on or after the Closing Date of any Acquired Company Benefit Plan; and

  

 (vi) any claim that the purchase and sale of the Shares or the transactions contemplated hereby give rise to any severance or other benefits under any Benefit Plan, except, in any such case, to the extent any such claim results in a Loss for which indemnification is available (without regard to the limitations set forth in Section 7.06(a)(ii)) to a Purchaser Indemnitee in accordance with Section 7.02.

  

 SECTION 7.04. Indemnification Procedures. (a) (i) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Third Party Claims. If any party (the "Indemnified Party") receives written notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding or the assertion of any claim by a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment (in each case other than with respect to Taxes, other than for Taxes due solely as a result of indemnification for claims other than Tax Claims) for which indemnity may be sought under Section 7.02 or 7.03 (a "Third Party Claim"), and such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly provide the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 45 days from receipt of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to assume the defense thereof. If notice to the effect set forth in the immediately preceding sentence is given by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice; provided, that the Indemnified Party does not reasonably object to such counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party will not have the right to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim relating to Environmental Losses (as defined in Section 7.06(a)(iv)) ("Third Party Environmental Claims"); provided, that in assuming the defense of any Third Party Environmental Claims, the Indemnified Party shall (x) retain counsel not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party and (y) consult on a regular basis with the Indemnifying Party regarding such claims (including any remedial actions or investigations relating to such claims) and provide the Indemnifying Party with any reports, communications with Governmental Entities or other documentation the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, to the extent such consultation or provision of information shall not require the waiver of the Indemnified Party\'s attorney-client privilege with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within 45 days of receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third Party Claim has been asserted will have the right to assume the defense thereof, at its sole cost and expense (or, if the Indemnified Party incurs a Loss with respect to the matter(s) in question for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.01 or 7.02, as applicable, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party), upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party at any time thereafter agrees to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party\'s counsel incurred prior to the time of the Indemnifying Party\'s assumption of such defense. So long as the Indemnifying Party has the right to assume and has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance herewith, (A) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party will not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (C) the Indemnifying Party will not (i) admit to any wrongdoing or (ii) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement (1) provides for equitable or other prospective relief or materially adversely affects the operation and conduct of the Business of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries or (2) relates to or arises in connection with a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, in each case, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which written consent, solely in the case of a judgment or settlement described in clause (C)(ii)(2) above, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The parties will use reasonable best efforts to minimize Losses from Third Party Claims and will act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with such claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense and give each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent (which written consent, solely in the case where the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  

 (ii) Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. The Indemnified Party will notify the Indemnifying Party in writing promptly of its discovery of any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from the Indemnified Party, giving rise to the claim of indemnity pursuant hereto. The failure so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party will have 45 days from receipt of any such notice to give notice of dispute of the claim to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will include providing upon reasonable notice reasonable access to the properties of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, using commercially reasonable efforts to make available employees to assist in the investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing other assistance, where commercially reasonable, with respect to such matters; provided, that such assistance and cooperation does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries.

  

 (b) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims. (i) If one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 of this Agreement (the "Tax Indemnifying Party"), and the other party to this Agreement (the "Tax Indemnified Party") receives a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, suit, dispute or other claim (a "Tax Claim") with respect (in whole or in part) to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Tax Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. The failure to so notify the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Tax Indemnifying Party of its liability on account of indemnification, except to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

  

 (ii) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the applicable audit or examination and the defense of a Tax Claim for which a majority of the Taxes potentially due are Taxes for which it has an obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 of this Agreement, and the Tax Indemnified Party and its affiliates shall provide such cooperation as the Tax Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in pursuing such contest, including execution of limited powers of attorney in favor of the Tax Indemnifying Party. Where a Tax Claim is not assumed and controlled by the Tax Indemnifying Party (either because the Tax Indemnifying Party did not elect to assume and control such contest or because the Tax Indemnifying Party did not have the right to assume and control such contest), the Tax Indemnifying Party agrees that it and its affiliates shall provide such cooperation as the Tax Indemnified Party may reasonably request in connection with such contest.

  

 (iii) Both parties agree to pursue with reasonable diligence the defense of Tax Claims that they control under this Section 7.04(b).

  

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the party controlling the applicable audit or examination or the defense of a Tax Claim agrees to keep the other party reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim with respect to Taxes for which such other party is responsible under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02, and the other party, at its own cost and expense and with its own counsel, shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the applicable audit or examination and defense of such Tax Claim with respect to Taxes for which such other party is responsible under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02. Each party agrees to take such steps as are reasonably available to it to permit the other party to exercise the participation rights described in this Section 7.04(c)(iv).

  

 (v) In no case shall any Tax Indemnified Party or Tax Indemnifying Party settle or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may settle or otherwise comprise a Tax Claim relating to Taxes without the consent of Purchaser where such settlement or compromise does not materially impact Taxes of Purchaser, including Taxes for a Post-Closing Period, for which Seller does not have an obligation to indemnify under Section 7.01 or Section 7.02.

  

 SECTION 7.05. Limitations on Tax Indemnification. Seller shall not have an obligation to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser or its affiliates for the payment of Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01(a) or Section 7.02(iv) unless Seller receives a written notice of a claim for indemnification prior to the time the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the liability for Taxes in question expires; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply if neither Purchaser, nor an affiliate thereof, as the case may be, has notice of liability for Taxes for which it seeks indemnification pursuant to Section 7.01(a) or 7.02(iv) until after or shortly before the applicable statute of limitations expires, and neither Purchaser, nor an affiliate thereof, as the case may be, can, using reasonable best efforts to provide such notice, provide notice of a claim for indemnification to Seller before such statute of limitations expires.

  

 SECTION 7.06. Limitations on Indemnification. (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VII:

  

 (i) Seller shall not be responsible, pursuant to Section 7.02, (A) for any indemnifiable Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller included herein unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing within eighteen months after the Closing Date, failing which such claim shall be waived and extinguished; provided, however, that a claim with respect to a breach of (w) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 and 2.05 to the extent they relate to the title to the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares may be made if asserted in writing at any time after the Closing Date, (x) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 2.03 to the extent they relate to the authorization of this Agreement may be made if asserted in writing at any time after the Closing Date, (y) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 2.12 may be made if asserted in writing at any time after the Closing Date until 45 days following the applicable statute of limitations and (z) the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 2.15(b) maybe made if asserted in writing within seven years after the Closing Date, in each case failing which such claims shall be waived and extinguished or (B) any indemnifiable Offsite Environmental Losses unless a claim therefor is asserted in writing within ten years after the Closing Date;

  

 (ii) Seller shall not be liable, pursuant to Section 7.02(i) (other than for any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in (A) Sections 2.02 and 2.05 to the extent they relate to the title to the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares and or (B) Section 2.15(b)) or Section 7.02 (iv), for (x) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees covered by this clause (ii) exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $3,500,000, and then only to the extent of any such excess or (y) any individual items where the Loss relating thereto is less than $25,000 (which individual items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x) unless they are part of a series of related items arising out of the same set of facts, in which case they shall be so aggregated);

  

 (iii) the aggregate liability of Seller hereunder (A) pursuant to Section 7.02(i) (other than for any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in (x) Sections 2.02 and 2.05 to the extent they relate to the title to the Shares and Subsidiary Shares or (y) in Section 2.15(b)) or Section 7.02(iv), for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed $80,000,000, (the "General Cap"), (B) pursuant to Section 7.02(i) (solely with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Sections 2.02 and 2.05 to the extent they relate to the title to the Shares and the Subsidiary Shares) or Section 7.02(vi), for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed $175,000,000 (the "Special Cap") and (C) pursuant to Section 7.02(vii), for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed $175,000,000 (the "Offsite Cap");

  

 (iv) Seller shall not be liable, pursuant to Section 7.02(i) (solely with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Section 2.15(b)), for (x) any Losses suffered by any Purchaser Indemnitee unless the aggregate of all Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees covered by this clause (iv) (such Losses, "Environmental Losses") exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $5,000,000, following which, Seller shall only be liable for: (A) 50% of Environmental Losses, if any, greater than $5,000,000 and less than or equal to $20,000,000; (B) all Environmental Losses, if any, greater than $20,000,000 and less than or equal to $80,000,000; and (C) 50% of Environmental Losses, if any, greater than $80,000,000 and less than or equal to $175,000,000 (the "Environmental Cap") or (y) any individual items where the Environmental Loss relating thereto is less than $8,750 (which individual items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (x) unless they are part of a series of related items arising out of the same set of facts, in which case, they shall be so aggregated);

  

 (v) Seller shall have liability for Environmental Losses and Offsite Environmental Losses incurred by any Purchaser Indemnitee (including the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries), in each case, only to the extent such Environmental Losses or Offsite Environmental Losses were incurred to comply with any applicable Environmental Laws or any order or directive arising thereunder using, in the case of any remedial action taken by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnitee (including the Acquired Company or any of its subsidiaries) after the Closing, reasonable and recognized remediation protocols and techniques that are economically reasonable in relation to other reasonable and recognized remediation protocols and techniques; provided, however, that Seller shall not have liability for such Environmental Losses or Offsite Environmental Losses to the extent Purchaser or any other party after Closing contributed to the condition or circumstance forming the basis of such Environmental Losses or Offsite Environmental Losses;

  

 (vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.06, the aggregate liability of Seller under the General Cap, the Special Cap, the Environmental Cap and the Offsite Cap for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall in no event exceed $175,000,000; and

  

 (vii) neither party hereto shall be liable to the other for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages claimed by such other party resulting from such first party\'s breach of its covenants, representations or warranties or any other indemnification obligation hereunder; provided, that nothing in this clause (vii) shall prevent either party from recovering such damages from the other party that are claimed by a third party pursuant to its Third Party Claim.

  

 In no event shall Seller be obligated to indemnify Purchaser or any other person with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter was reflected in the calculation of the adjustment to the Purchase Price, if any, pursuant to Section 1.04(c).

  

 (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, other than the representations and warranties of Seller specifically contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.02(a), none of Seller, the Acquired Company, the subsidiaries of the Acquired Company or any other person has made any representation or warranty either expressed or implied (A) with respect to the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries or their respective assets and liabilities, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Shares or (B) as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries furnished or made available to Purchaser and its representatives (including the Confidential Information Memorandum relating to the Metalcutting Tools Business of Seller dated February 2001 and the Confidential Information Memorandum relating to the Metalworking Technologies Group of Seller dated February 2001, both of which were prepared by Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, and any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser and its representatives in certain "data rooms", management presentations or any other form).

  

 (c) Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement, the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries or their respective assets and liabilities, the transactions contemplated hereby and the Shares (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser (on behalf of itself and its affiliates (including the Acquired Company)) hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) Purchaser, the Acquired Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or any other Purchaser Indemnitee may have against Seller or any of its affiliates arising under or based upon any Federal, state, local or foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII).

  

 SECTION 7.07. Calculation of Indemnity Payments. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article VII shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies or under any underground storage tank or similar environmental reimbursement program with respect to such Loss (such policies and programs, the "Available Policies and Programs"). The Indemnified Party agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to pursue (and collect on) any recovery available under any Available Policies and Programs; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to withhold the payment of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article VII pending the resolution of the pursuit of any such recovery. For purposes of determining amounts actually recovered under any Available Policies and Programs, the actual amount recovered shall be net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in pursuing (and collecting on) any such recoveries (including any increases in insurance premiums, any retrospective premium adjustments and experience-based premium adjustments, in each case, to the extent directly resulting from such recovery).

  

 SECTION 7.08. Tax Treatment of Indemnification. For all Tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form, to the extent applicable) provides otherwise.

   

ARTICLE VIII

  

Non-Solicitation; Non-Competition

  

 SECTION 8.01. Covenant Not To Solicit for Employment. (a) For a period of one year from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any management-level employee of the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to (i) a general advertisement or solicitation program that is not specifically targeted at such persons or (ii) the solicitation of any management-level employee of the Acquired Company or a subsidiary of the Acquired Company whose employment by the Acquired Company or such subsidiary has been terminated.

  

 (b) For a period of one year from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of its affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any management-level employee of Seller or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to (i) a general advertisement or solicitation program that is not specifically targeted at such persons or (ii) the solicitation of any management-level employee of Seller or any of its subsidiaries whose employment by Seller or such subsidiary has been terminated.

  

 SECTION 8.02. Seller\'s Covenant Not To Compete. Except as provided in Section 8.03, for a period of three years from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, engage in the business of manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling inserts and tool holders (or any components thereof) of the type that the Acquired Company and its subsidiaries manufacture, market, distribute or sell as of the date hereof (the "Business"); provided, however, that (i) Seller and its affiliates may own as a passive investment, directly or indirectly, securities of any corporation or other entity engaged in the Business if Seller and its affiliates do not, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate more than 15% of the outstanding shares of such entity; and (ii) Seller or its affiliates may own any corporation or other entity engaged in the Business, provided that such Business accounts for neither more than 20% of such entity\'s consolidated annual revenues nor more than 20% of such entity\'s consolidated assets.

  

 SECTION 8.03. Permitted Activities of Seller. Notwithstanding anything in Section 8.02 to the contrary, Seller and its affiliates shall not be prevented from (i) continuing to engage in, conducting or having an ownership interest in any business (including the Widia metalcutting tools business, the Werko and Talbot round tools businesses, the Cimcool and Widacool businesses, the Milpro business and the plastics technologies maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) business of Seller and its subsidiaries) which it currently is engaging in, conducting or in which it currently has an ownership interest (other than the Business), and any reasonable extension or development thereof and (ii) treating the provisions of Section 8.02 as having terminated at the time and to the extent none of Purchaser and its subsidiaries continues to conduct in any material respect the Business.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned by either party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, except that (a) Purchaser may assign its right to purchase the Shares hereunder to one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Seller and may designate one or more of its direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries as the purchaser of any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Acquired Company in accordance with Section 1.01, (b) Seller may assign any rights and obligations hereunder to any of the Seller Entities without the prior written consent of Purchaser and (c) an assignment by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation shall not require the consent of the other parties hereto.
