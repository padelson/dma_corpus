SECTION 2.06 Post-Closing Adjustment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as specified in this Section
2.06:

  

  

(a) Closing Statement. As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 50
calendar days following the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to Quanta the
Closing Statement, together with a reasonable itemization and reasonable
supporting detail of each item and amount set forth therein. For the purposes
of preparing the Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall use the Insurance
Claims Accrual as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement.

  

  

(b) Disputes. Subject to this Section 2.06(b), the Closing Statement delivered
by the Purchaser to Quanta shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties hereto.

  

  

(i) Quanta may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Statement other
than the Insurance Claims Accrual, but only on the basis that the amounts
reflected on the Closing Statement (A) were not arrived at in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the Audited Financial Statements and
the preparation of the Example Statement of Net Working Capital, or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(B) were arrived at based on factual, mathematical or clerical error or
differences in accounting judgments or estimates; provided, however, that
Quanta shall have notified the Purchaser in writing of each disputed item,
specifying the estimated amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in
reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 20 Business Days of the
Purchaser's delivery of the Closing Statement to Quanta. During such 20
Business Days, to the extent reasonably requested by Quanta, the Purchaser
will make available to Quanta and its auditors and advisors all records and
work papers used in preparing the Closing Statement, including the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and provide reasonable access to members of its
accounting and financial staff in connection with Quanta's review thereof. In
the event that Quanta delivers a notice of dispute as set forth above, the
Sellers' Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants shall attempt to
reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. If the
Sellers' Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants are unable to reach a
resolution with such effect within 20 Business Days after the receipt by the
Purchaser of Quanta's written notice of dispute, the Sellers' Accountants and
the Purchaser's Accountants shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to Ernst and Young LLP (or, if such firm shall decline or is unable
to act or is not, at the time of such submission, independent of the Sellers,
Dycom and the Purchaser, to another independent accounting firm of
international reputation mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Purchaser)
(either Ernst and Young LLP or such other accounting firm being referred to
herein as the "Independent Accounting Firm"). The Purchaser and Quanta shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to, within 30 days after such submission, determine what it believes in
its professional judgment to be the most accurate calculation of the remaining
disputed items in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and report to
Quanta and the Purchaser upon such remaining disputed items, and such report
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Sellers, Dycom and the
Purchaser. With respect to each disputed item, such determination of the
Independent Account Firm shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated by the Purchaser in the Closing Statement
or Quanta in the notice of dispute. The Purchaser and Quanta shall cooperate
with the Independent Accounting Firm and shall provide the Independent
Accounting Firm access to such books and records as it may request to make its
determinations and report. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Sellers and the Purchaser in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items
so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted.

  

  

(ii) In acting under this Agreement, the Sellers' Accountants, the Purchaser's
Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the
privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

  

  

(c) Purchase Price Adjustment. The Closing Statement shall be deemed final for
the purposes of this Section 2.06 upon the earliest of (x) the failure of
Quanta to notify the Purchaser of a dispute within 20 Business Days of the
Purchaser's delivery of the Closing Statement to Quanta, (y) the resolution of
all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.06(b)(i), by the Sellers' Accountants and
the Purchaser's Accountants, and (z) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant
to Section 2.06(b)(i), by the Independent Accounting Firm. Within three
Business Days of the Closing Statement being deemed final, a Purchase Price
adjustment shall be made as follows:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

 

(i) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Purchaser
shall pay to Quanta (on behalf of the Sellers) an amount equal to such
positive amount, net of applicable withholding Taxes, if any, by wire transfer
or delivery of immediately available funds.

  

  

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Quanta (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the
absolute value of such negative number, by wire transfer or delivery of
immediately available funds.

  

 

  

(d) Interest on Payments. Any payments required to be made by Quanta or the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall bear interest for each day from
the Closing Date through the date of payment at the rate stated in the "Money
Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal published as the one month London
Interbank Offered Rate for such day (or if such day is not a day on which such
rate is published, for the preceding day on which such rate was published)
plus 200 basis points and based on a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed.

Financial Statements and Unaudited Financial Statements against all material
Liabilities of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries in amounts that

Property, an Acquired Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, has (or, upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transition Services Agreement, an Acquired Company, a Subsidiary or an
Affiliate of Dycom, as the case may be, will have) good and marketable title
to, or, in the case of leased Assets, valid and subsisting leasehold interests
in, all the Assets, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except Permitted
Encumbrances and Encumbrances set forth in Section 3.19(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Assets, Purchased Assets, and Retained Names constitute, in all
material respects, all the properties, assets and rights forming a part of,
used, held or intended to be used in the Business of the Acquired Companies
and Subsidiaries, and all such properties, assets and rights as are necessary
in the conduct of the Business as currently conducted by the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries. The IT Assets owned by the Acquired Companies
and the Subsidiaries, together with any rights of the Acquired Companies and
the Subsidiaries to use the IT Assets of the Sellers or their Affiliates under
the Transition Services Agreement, constitute in all material respects all IT
Assets as are reasonably necessary in the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted by the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries. Except with respect
to any Assets that constitute Real Property, the Sellers have caused the
Assets to be maintained in accordance with good business practice, and all the
Assets are, in all material respects, in good operating condition and repair
and are suitable for the purposes for which they are used and intended to be
used, normal wear and tear excepted.

  

  

(c) Section 3.19(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
vehicles owned by the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries.

  

  

SECTION 3.20 Customers. Listed in Section 3.20 of the Disclosure Schedule are
the names of the twenty most significant customers (by revenue) of the
Business of the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries during each of the 2010
and 2011 fiscal years, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2012,
showing approximate total revenue received in each such period for each such
customer. None of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries has
received any written notice and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, none of the
Sellers, the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries has received any other notice,
that any such significant customer of the Business has ceased, or will cease,
to use the services of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary, or has
substantially reduced, or will substantially reduce, the use of such services
at any time, it being understood that neither the expiration of an existing
Contract in accordance with its terms nor the failure in the ordinary course
of business to obtain a Contract or an award of additional work under a
Contract from an existing customer constitutes such notice.

  

  

SECTION 3.21 Employee Benefit Matters.

  

  

(a) Plans and Material Documents. Section 3.21(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
lists (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination, severance or other contracts or agreements, whether
legally enforceable or not, to which any Acquired Company or Subsidiary is a
party, with respect to which any Acquired Company or Subsidiary has any
obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer or director of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary, (ii) each
employee benefit plan for which any Acquired Company or Subsidiary could incur
liability under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were
to be terminated,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) any plan in respect of which any Acquired Company or Subsidiary could
incur liability under Section 4212(c) of ERISA, and (iv) any contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
and any employee of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary, including any
contracts, arrangements or understandings relating to the sale of the Acquired
Companies (collectively, the "Plans"). Except as set forth in Section 3.21(a)
of the Disclosure Schedule, each Plan is in writing and, except with respect
to any Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, the Sellers have furnished to the
Purchaser a complete and accurate copy of each Plan and a complete and
accurate copy of each material document prepared in connection with each such
Plan, including a copy of (A) each trust or other funding arrangement, (B)
each summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (C) the
most recently filed IRS Form 5500, (D) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each such Plan, and (E) the most recently prepared
actuarial report and financial statement in connection with each such Plan.
There are no other employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements or
agreements, whether formal or informal, whether in writing or not, to which
any Acquired Company or Subsidiary is a party, with respect to which any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by any Acquired Company or Subsidiary for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary. No Acquired Company or Subsidiary has any express or
implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, (I) to create, incur
liability with respect to, or cause to exist, any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement, (II) to enter into any contract or agreement to
provide compensation or benefits to any individual, or (III) to modify, change
or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or
termination required by ERISA or the Code.

  

  

(b) Absence of Certain Types of Plans. Except as listed in Section 3.21(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule, none of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a
single employer pension plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of
ERISA) for which any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary could incur liability
under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the
Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance
benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary other than as required under Section 4980B of
the Code or any similar applicable state or local law. Each of the Plans is
subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political subdivision
thereof.

  

  

(c) Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as set forth in Section 3.21(c) of
the Disclosure Schedule, each Plan is now and always has been operated in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of all applicable Law,
including ERISA and the Code, and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, all Persons who
participate in the operation of such Plans and all Plan "fiduciaries" (within
the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have always acted in all material
respects in accordance with the provisions of all applicable Law, including
ERISA and the Code. Each Acquired Company and Subsidiary has performed all
material obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in any
material respect in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of
any default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or,
to the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that
could give rise to any such Action.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Qualification of Certain Plans. Except with respect to any Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan, each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified or has received an
opinion or advisory letter from the IRS on which it may rely, and each trust
established in connection with any Plan that is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt or has received an
opinion or advisory letter from the IRS on which it may rely, and no fact or
event has occurred since the date of such determination, opinion or advisory
letter from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. Each
trust maintained or contributed to by any Acquired Company or Subsidiary that
is intended to be qualified as a voluntary employees' beneficiary association
and that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(c)(9) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS that it is so qualified and so exempt, and no fact or event has occurred
since the date of such determination by the IRS to adversely affect such
qualified or exempt status.

  

  

(e) Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. There has been no prohibited
transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code) with respect to any Plan, which is not otherwise exempt under Section
408 of ERISA, and that would reasonably be expected to subject an Acquired
Company or Subsidiary to any material liability. No Acquired Company or
Subsidiary has incurred any liability for any penalty or tax arising under
Section 4971, 4972, 4980, 4980B or 6652 of the Code or any liability under
Section 502 of ERISA, and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such liability. No Acquired Company or Subsidiary
has incurred any liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV
of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course), including any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists that
could give rise to any such liability. No complete or partial termination has
occurred within the five years preceding the date hereof with respect to any
Plan. No reportable event (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has
occurred or is expected to occur with respect to any Plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA. Except with respect to any Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan, no
Plan had an accumulated funding deficiency (within the meaning of Section 302
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the most
recently ended plan year of such Plan. None of the assets of any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary is the subject of any lien arising under Section 302(f)
of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code; no Acquired Company or Subsidiary has
been required to post any security under Section 307 of ERISA or Section
401(a)(29) of the Code; and no fact or event exists which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such lien or requirement to post any such
security.

  

  

 

(f) Plan Contributions and Funding. All contributions, premiums or payments
required to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or before their
due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax
purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any
Governmental Authority, and no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Section 409A. Section 3.21(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
Plan that is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code (each, a "Section 409A Plan"), and identifies each
Section 409A Plan in connection with which any of the Acquired Companies or
any Subsidiary may have liability with respect to current or former employees,
contractors or directors. No such Plan has assets set aside directly or
indirectly in the manner described in Section 409A(b)(1) of the Code or
contains a provision that would be subject to Section 409A(b)(2) of the Code.
Each Section 409A Plan (i) was, for the period beginning on the later of (A)
January 1, 2005, and (B) the date of the inception of such Plan, and ending on
December 31, 2008, administered in good faith compliance with the requirements
of Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder, (ii)
has been, since the later of (A) January 1, 2009, and (B) the date of the
inception of such Plan, administered in compliance, in all material respects,
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations
issued and outstanding thereunder, and (iii) has been, since the later of (A)
January 1, 2009, and (B) the date of the inception of such Plan, in a written
form that complies with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and final
regulations issued and outstanding thereunder, such that in the event of an
audit by the Internal Revenue Service of either the relevant Acquired Company
or Subsidiary or any individual participating in such Plan, no material
liability would be incurred by the Acquired Company or Subsidiary with respect
to benefits due or accruing under such Plan.

  

  

(h) Multiemployer Plans. With respect to each Plan that is a Multiemployer
Plan, the Sellers have furnished to Purchaser, as applicable (i) the most
recently received or obtained estimate of withdrawal liability, (ii) the most
recently received or obtained actuarial report, and (iii) any material
correspondence relating to its funded status (including any correspondence
regarding a funding improvement plan, a rehabilitation plan or a plan
reorganization or termination), contribution requirements and legal
compliance. In addition, Section 3.21(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all
such Plans and specifies whether each such Plan is in endangered, seriously
endangered, critical or reorganization status or is subject to termination. To
the Sellers' Knowledge, no written notice of any withdrawal liability has been
received by Sellers, any Acquired Company or any Subsidiary with respect to a
Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan.

  

  

(i) Transfer of Employees. Since September 1, 2012, none of the Sellers or
their Affiliates have transferred any employees from an Acquired Company or
Subsidiary to any of the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than an Acquired
Company or Subsidiary) except in connection with the Restructuring
Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 3.22 Labor and Employment Matters. (a) Except as set forth in Section
3.22(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Acquired Company or Subsidiary is a

circumstances relating solely to the Sellers, the execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Purchaser and Dycom of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party do not and will not (a) violate,
conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Purchaser or Dycom, (b) conflict with or
violate any Law or Governmental Order applicable to the Purchaser or Dycom or
any of their respective assets, properties or businesses, or (c) conflict

require any consent under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration, suspension, revocation or cancellation of, any note,
bond, mortgage or indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license,
permit, franchise or other instrument or arrangement to which the Purchaser or
Dycom is a party, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not
adversely affect the ability of the Purchaser or Dycom to carry out its
obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

SECTION 4.03 Governmental Consents and Approvals. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Purchaser and Dycom of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser or Dycom is a party do not and will
not require any consent, approval, authorization or other order of, action by,
filing with, or notification to any Governmental Authority, except (a) as
described in a writing given to the Sellers by the Purchaser on the date of
this Agreement and (b) the pre-merger notification and waiting period
requirements of the HSR Act.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 4.04 Investment Purpose. (a) The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares
solely for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for offer or
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. The Purchaser acknowledges
that the Shares are not registered under the Securities Act or any state
securities laws, and that the Shares may not be transferred or sold except
pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or pursuant to
an applicable exemption therefrom and subject to state securities laws and
regulations, as applicable. The Purchaser is able to bear the economic risk of
holding the Shares for an indefinite period (including total loss of its
investment), and has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risk of its
investment.

  

  

(b) The Purchaser will, as a result of borrowings under the Dycom Credit
Agreement or other sources of financing (the "Financing") together with cash
on hand, have sufficient immediately available funds to pay the Estimated
Purchase Price and sufficient available funds to pay any adjustments to the
Estimated Purchase Price, to consummate all of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement upon the terms contemplated hereby, to pay all related fees
and expenses associated therewith, and to satisfy all of its other obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 4.05 Litigation. No Action by or against the Purchaser or Dycom is
pending or, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser and Dycom, threatened,
which could affect the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including the Financing).

  

  

SECTION 4.06 Brokers. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Barclays Capital, no
broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Dycom or the
Purchaser. The Purchaser is solely responsible for payment of the fees and
expenses of Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Barclays Capital.

  

  

SECTION 4.07 Solvency. Neither Dycom nor the Purchaser is entering into this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby with the actual intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors. After giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at and immediately
after the Closing, each of Dycom, the Purchaser and their respective
subsidiaries will be solvent (in that both the fair value of such Person's
assets will not be less than the sum of such Person's debts and that the
present fair saleable value of such Person's assets will not be less than the
amount required to pay such Person's probable liability on such Person's
recourse debts as they mature or become due).

  

  

SECTION 4.08 Independent Investigation. Dycom and the Purchaser have conducted
their own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
results of operations, financial condition and assets of the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries. Each of Dycom and the Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it has relied solely upon its
own investigation and the express representations and warranties of the
Sellers set forth in this Agreement (including the related portions of the
Disclosure Schedule) and any certificate delivered by the Sellers hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Except for such representations and warranties, (a) Dycom and the Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that no Seller, Acquired Company, Subsidiary or other
Person is making or has made any representation or warranty, expressed or
implied, at Law or in equity, in respect of the Business or any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary, either Seller or this Agreement, and no officer, agent,
representative or employee of any Seller, Acquired Company or Subsidiary has
any authority, express or implied, to make any other representations or
warranties, or agreements not specifically set forth in this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or the License Agreement, and in each case subject to the
limited remedies herein provided, (b) each of Dycom and the Purchaser
specifically disclaims that it is relying upon or has relied upon any such
other representations or warranties that may have been made by any Person, and
(c) the Purchaser is acquiring the Acquired Companies based upon the express
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement
(including the related portions of the Disclosure Schedule) and any
certificate delivered by the Sellers hereunder, and subject to the remedies as
set forth in Article IX.

earlier of the time of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article X, it will cause the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries
to conduct their business in the ordinary course and consistent with prior

effect without material modification all existing policies or binders of
insurance currently maintained in respect of each Acquired Company and
Subsidiary and their Business, and (D) preserve their current relationships
with their customers, suppliers and other persons with which they have had
significant business relationships; (iv) exercise any rights of renewal
pursuant to the terms of any of the leases or subleases set forth in Section
3.18(b) of the Disclosure Schedule which by their terms would otherwise
expire; and (v) not engage in any practice, take any action, fail to take any
action or enter into any transaction which could cause any representation or
warranty of the Sellers to be untrue in any material respect or result in a
material breach of any covenant made by the Sellers in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as described in Section 5.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (those
intercompany transactions listed under the heading "Restructuring
Transactions" in such Section 5.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule are referred
to herein as the "Restructuring Transactions"),

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

each Seller, jointly and severally, covenants and agrees that, from the date
hereof until the earlier of the time of the Closing and the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article X, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of
the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries will do any of the things specified in
the second sentence of Section 3.12.

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Closing, Quanta shall cause Sunesys, LLC ("Sunesys") to
enter into an agreement with Dycom, its Affiliate or an Acquired Company
pursuant to which Sunesys, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns,
commits to retain such party to provide, consistent in the amount historically
provided, those telecom engineering, construction and maintenance services
historically performed by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing and that
are required by Sunesys during the four year period subsequent to the Closing,
on terms substantially similar to the terms upon which the Acquired Companies
historically performed such services for Sunesys. In addition, at or prior to
the Closing, Quanta shall cause Sunesys to transfer to Blair Park Services,
LLC the employees named on Section 5.01(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

SECTION 5.02 Access to Information. (a) From the date hereof until the
Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Sellers shall cause each of their
officers, employees, agents, representatives, accountants and counsel, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries and each of the
Acquired Companies' and the Subsidiaries' officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives, accountants and counsel to: (i) afford the officers,
employees, agents, accountants, counsel, financing sources and representatives
of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business hours, under
reasonable circumstances and at mutually agreed locations, to the offices,
properties, plants, other facilities, books and records of each Acquired
Company and Subsidiary and to those officers, employees, agents, accountants
and counsel of any of the Sellers, the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries
who have knowledge relating to any of the Acquired Companies or the
Subsidiaries or their Business and (ii) furnish to the officers, employees,
agents, accountants, counsel, financing sources and representatives of the
Purchaser such additional financial and operating data and other information
(to the extent in the possession of the Sellers or any Acquired Company or
Subsidiary) regarding the assets, properties, liabilities and goodwill of the
Acquired Companies, the Subsidiaries and their Business (or legible copies
thereof) as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent that Sellers determine (after consultation
with outside counsel) that disclosure of any such information is not
consistent with recommended antitrust practices, Sellers will disclose that
information under the terms of the Antitrust Confidentiality Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not be required to provide any such access or disclose any such information to
the Purchaser or Dycom or any such other person if such disclosure would, in
the Sellers' discretion (after consultation with outside counsel), (i)
jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any
applicable Laws. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
give to Dycom or the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, any rights to control
or direct the operations of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary prior to the
Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision of the operations of the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Dycom and the Purchaser hereby agree that they are not authorized to and shall
not (and shall not permit any of their Affiliates or any of their respective
employees, officers, counsel, accountants, consultants, financing sources or
other representatives or agents to) contact any competitor, supplier,
distributor, or customer of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary with respect to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the
Closing without the prior written consent of Quanta (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, if Quanta so elects, only in the
presence of an agent or representative specified by Quanta.

  

  

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Sellers prior to the Closing or for any other reasonable
purpose, including Quanta's SEC reporting obligations, for a period of seven
years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and
records relating to the Acquired Companies, the Subsidiaries, their Business
and their operations relating to periods prior to the Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the prior practice of the Acquired Companies and
the Subsidiaries and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers,
employees, agents and representatives of the Sellers reasonable access
(including the right to make, at the Sellers' expense, photocopies), during
normal business hours, to such books and records.

  

  

(c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or Subsidiary after the
Closing or for any other reasonable purpose, for a period of seven years
following the Closing Date, each Seller shall (i) retain the books and records
of such Seller which relate to the Acquired Companies, the Subsidiaries, their
Business and their operations for periods prior to the Closing and which shall
not otherwise have been delivered to the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or
Subsidiary and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees,
agents and representatives of the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or
Subsidiary reasonable access (including the right to make photocopies, at the
expense of the Purchaser or such Acquired Company or Subsidiary), during
normal business hours, to such books and records.

  

  

(d) In connection with preparation of the Closing Statement by Purchaser,
Purchaser will provide Quanta with the preliminary closing statement prepared
by each of the reporting Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries within two
Business Days after such statement has been provided to Dycom or the
Purchaser; provided that the Purchaser makes no representation as to the
accuracy, completeness or conformance to the requirements of the Closing
Statement of such preliminary information. In addition, Dycom and the
Purchaser will, and will cause the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries to, use
all reasonable efforts to ensure that the reporting timelines adhered to by
the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and as required
by Quanta as part of its monthly closing process are complied with for
Quanta's reporting period that includes the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) At or promptly following the Closing, Quanta shall provide to the
Purchaser all materials that were made available in the physical data room in
connection with Dycom's evaluation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including electronic copies of any lists or summaries prepared with respect to
such materials.

  

  

SECTION 5.03 Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
(i) both the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Antitrust Confidentiality
Agreement remain in full force and effect and (ii) both the Non-Disclosure
Agreement and the Antitrust Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect from and after the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

From and after the Closing Date until (except with respect to trade secrets)
the date that is three years after the Closing Date, each Seller shall, and
shall cause its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and
directors to: (a) except as provided in clause (c) below, treat and hold as
confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person to) all
information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent applications, product
development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing and marketing plans,
policies and strategies, details of client and consultant contracts,
operations methods, product development techniques, business acquisition
plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all other confidential or
proprietary information with respect to each Acquired Company and Subsidiary
and their Business; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers and their agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and
directors shall be free to use any information retained in their unaided
memory (including general ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained
therein) other than where such use is expressly in violation of another
provision of this Agreement, including Sections 5.07 and 5.08 hereof, provided
that they shall maintain the confidentiality of the information subject to the
foregoing confidentiality restrictions and the foregoing shall not be deemed
to grant to the Sellers or any of their agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers or directors a license under the Patent Rights, (b) in the
event that such Seller or any such agent, representative, Affiliate, employee,
officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose any such
information, provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice of such
requirement so that the Purchaser or any Acquired Company or Subsidiary may
seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section
5.03, (c) in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
timely obtained, or the Purchaser waives compliance with this Section 5.03,
furnish only that portion of such confidential information which is legally
required to be provided and exercise its reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such information, and
(d) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as soon as practicable following, the
Closing) to the Acquired Companies or the Purchaser any and all copies (in
whatever form or medium) of all such confidential information then in the
possession of such Seller or any of its agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers or directors or, except as otherwise required or permitted
by Section 5.02(c) or to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable
Laws, rules or regulations, destroy any and all additional copies then in the
possession of such Seller or any of its agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers or directors of such information and of any analyses,
compilations, studies or other documents prepared, in whole or in part, on the
basis thereof; provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to any
information that (A) at the time of disclosure, is available publicly and was
not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by such Seller, its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors or (B) is
lawfully obtained or developed by any Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective agents, representatives, employees, officers or directors
from and after the Closing from sources which are not legally prohibited from
disclosing such information; and provided further that, with respect to
Intellectual Property, specific detailed information shall not be deemed to be
within the foregoing exception (A) merely because a principal of operation is
embraced in general disclosures in the public domain. In addition, with
respect to Intellectual Property, any combination of features shall not be
deemed to be within the foregoing exception (A) merely because the individual
features are in the public domain unless the combination itself and its
principle of operation are in the public domain.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.04 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents. (a)
Each of Dycom, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain (or cause the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries to
obtain) all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the other
party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals. On October 15, 2012, each party hereto filed its Notification
and Report Form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) this Agreement shall not
obligate the Purchaser, Dycom or any of their Affiliates to make any sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of the assets, properties or
businesses of the Purchaser, Dycom or any of their Affiliates or of the
assets, properties businesses to be acquired pursuant hereto or otherwise take
any action that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability
to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Purchaser,
Dycom, and their Affiliates or those that the Purchaser and Dycom are
acquiring pursuant to this Agreement, and (y) no party hereto shall be
required to pay any fees or other payments to any Governmental Authorities in
order to obtain any such authorization, consent, order or approval (other than
normal filing fees that are imposed by Law on any of the parties hereto). The
Sellers, Dycom, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall not extend
any waiting period or comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, except with the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  

  

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Section 5.04
and permit the other party to review in advance (and to consider any comments
made by the other party in relation to) any proposed communication by such
party to any Governmental Authority relating to such matters. Neither of the
parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any substantive
meeting, telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any submissions, filings, investigations, or any other inquiry
relating to such matters unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
party (or their external legal counsel in order to address any concerns
relating to confidential or competitively sensitive information) the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting, telephone call or
discussion. The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Sellers shall, or shall cause the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries to, give promptly such notices to third parties and use its or
their reasonable efforts to obtain such third party consents and estoppel
certificates necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) The Purchaser shall cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to assist the
Sellers in giving such notices and obtaining such consents and estoppel
certificates; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall have no obligation
to give any guarantee or other consideration of any nature in connection with
any such notice, consent or estoppel certificate or to consent to any change
in the terms of any agreement or arrangement which the Purchaser in its sole
discretion may deem materially adverse to the interests of the Purchaser, any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary or their Business.

  

  

(e) The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that, in the event that any consent,
approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary or their Business any right or benefit under any lease,
license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to which any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary is a party is not obtained prior to the
Closing, the Sellers will, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with the
Purchaser or such Acquired Company or Subsidiary in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If
such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, the Sellers shall
use their reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser or such Acquired Company
or Subsidiary, as the case may be, with the rights and benefits of the
affected lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or
arrangement for the term of such lease, license, contract or other agreement
or arrangement, and, if the Seller provides such rights and benefits, such
Acquired Company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations and burdens thereunder.

  

  

SECTION 5.05 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, each party shall
promptly notify the other parties in writing of (a) all events, circumstances,
facts and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
could result in any material breach of a representation or warranty or
covenant of such party in this Agreement or which could have the effect of
making any representation or warranty of such party in this Agreement untrue
or incorrect in any material respect and (b) all other material developments
arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement affecting the assets,
Liabilities, business, financial condition, operations, results of operations,
customer or supplier relations, employee relations, projections or prospects
of such party (or, with respect to the Sellers, the Acquired Companies and
Subsidiaries); provided, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.05 shall not limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies
available hereunder to the recipient of such notice.

  

  

SECTION 5.06 Intellectual Property. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall provide the Purchaser with a schedule that lists all of the applicable
filings, recordings and other acts, and all fees, Taxes and other payments,
that are required to be made within sixty (60) days after Closing to maintain
the validity and enforceability of the Owned Intellectual Property and the
Acquired Companies' and the Subsidiaries' interest therein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Sellers agree that they shall assign or cause to be assigned all
right, title and interest in, to and under the Patent Rights from Quanta
Associates, L.P. to CertusView Technologies, LLC at the Closing pursuant to a
duly executed written assignment agreement substantially in the form attached
as Exhibit F hereto (the "Assignment Agreement").

  

  

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that, at the Closing, CertusView
Solutions, LLC and Quanta Associates, L.P. shall execute a license agreement
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit G hereto (the "License
Agreement") whereby (i) CertusView Solutions, LLC grants to Quanta Associates,
L.P. and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free and, except
as may be permitted in the License Agreement, non-transferable, non-
assignable, irrevocable, and non-sublicenseable right and license in the
United States and its territories and possessions for Quanta Associates, L.P.
and its Affiliates solely to make and have made for it, use related to making
and having made for it, and import from anywhere in the world into the United
States and its territories and possessions for purposes of making and having
made for it, any products or parts thereof embodying the inventions that are
encompassed by one or more claims of a patent issuing from the Patent Rights,
but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any right to promote, sell or offer
to sell any such products or parts in the United States and its territories
and possessions to engage in the Business; and (ii) CertusView Solutions, LLC
grants to Quanta Associates, L.P. and its Affiliates an exclusive (except as
to certain rights that are retained by CertusView Solutions, LLC and its
Affiliates), perpetual, royalty free and, except as may be permitted in the
License Agreement, non-transferable, non-assignable, irrevocable and non-
sublicenseable right and license for Quanta Associates, L.P. and its
Affiliates to exploit in any manner whatsoever the Patent Rights (which right
shall include the rights to make and have made for it, use, sell and import
goods and services embodying the inventions encompassed by one or more claims
of the Patent Rights) anywhere worldwide other than in the United States and
its territories and possessions.

  

  

(d) The Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries shall have a
limited, non-transferable and non-assignable (except in accordance with
Section 11.06), non-sublicenseable, non-exclusive right to use all of the
Acquired Companies' and the Subsidiaries' existing stocks of (i) signs and
vehicles upon which the Retained Names appear as of the Closing Date for a
period of two hundred seventy (270) days after the Closing Date and (ii)
letterheads, invoice stock, advertisements and promotional materials,
inventory and other documents and materials upon which the Retained Names
appear as of the Closing Date for a period of ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date (the items described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Existing
Stock"), after which dates Dycom and the Purchaser shall cause each Acquired
Company and Subsidiary to remove, delete or obliterate all Retained Names from
such Existing Stock or cease to use such Existing Stock, respectively;
however, for the avoidance of any doubt, Purchaser, Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries shall not have any right whatsoever to use any of the Retained
Names in order to create any new materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Dycom and the Purchaser shall cause each Acquired Company and Subsidiary to
remove, delete or obliterate all Retained Names from such Existing Stock or
cease to use such Existing Stock, in each case, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries to, use the Existing Stock in
substantially the same manner as with respect to which the Retained Names were
used prior to the Closing and, in any event, agrees that (i) the nature and
quality of all goods sold and services rendered by Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries in connection with the Retained Names and all
Existing Stock shall be consistent in all material respects with the past
practice of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries and (ii) the Sellers
shall be provided reasonable access, upon reasonable advance written notice,
to confirm compliance with clause (i).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Dycom and the Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, but in no event later than sixty (60) days thereafter, cause
each Acquired Company and Subsidiary, as applicable, that has a corporate or
limited liability company name that contains a Retained Name to file an
amended certificate of incorporation or certificate of formation, as
applicable, with the appropriate authorities changing its corporate or limited
liability company name, respectively, to a corporate or limited liability
company name that does not contain any Retained Names, and to supply any
additional information and documentary materials that may be requested by the
Sellers with respect to such filings.

  

  

(f) To the extent that any of the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries have
utilized any Shared Business Processes, Sellers agree that employees of the
Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries shall have a right after the Closing to
continue to use any information about the Shared Business Processes that is
retained by them in their unaided memory (including general ideas, concepts,
know-how or techniques contained therein).

third anniversary of the Closing Date, except as contemplated in connection
with the Restructuring Transactions, each of the Sellers shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to, solicit for employment or hire any individuals
(i) who are (at any time from the date of this Agreement until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date) employees of any of the Acquired Companies or
Subsidiaries who are or have been primarily engaged in the provision of
telecommunications infrastructure services at the foreman or supervisor level
or above or (ii) who are employees of the Purchaser or Dycom with whom the
Sellers first came into contact in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the solicitation (as opposed to hire)
restrictions in Section 5.07(a) shall not apply to any solicitation by way of
general advertising, including general solicitations in any local, regional or
national newspapers or other publications or circulars or on internet sites or
any search firm engagement which is not directed or focused specifically on
employees of the Acquired Companies, the Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates and (ii) the restrictions in Section 5.07(a) shall not apply to the
hiring of a person who has not been so employed for the past six months and
who was not solicited by either of the Sellers (or their Affiliates) in
violation of this Section 5.07 prior to termination of his or her employment.

  

  

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, each of Dycom and the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, solicit for employment or hire any individuals who are
employees of any of the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries) with whom Dycom or the Purchaser first came
into contact in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
(i) the solicitation (as opposed to hire) restrictions in this Section 5.07(c)
shall not apply to any solicitation by way of general advertising, including
general solicitations in any local, regional or national newspapers or other
publications or circulars or on internet sites or any search firm engagement
which is not directed or focused specifically on employees of any of the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries) and (ii) the restrictions in this Section 5.07(c) shall not
apply to the hiring of a person who has not been so employed for the past six
months and who was not solicited by any of Dycom, the Purchaser and their
Affiliates in violation of this Section 5.07(c) prior to termination of his or
her employment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.08 Non Competition. (a) For a period of four years after the
Closing, none of the Sellers or their Affiliates shall engage, directly or
indirectly, in the Business or the Restricted Services or, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own an interest in,
manage, operate, join, control, lend money or render financial or other
material assistance to or participate in any Person that engages in the
Business or the Restricted Services; provided, however, that, for the purposes
of this Section 5.08, ownership of securities having no more than five percent
of the outstanding voting power of any such Person that is listed on any
national securities exchange shall not be deemed to be in violation of this
Section 5.08 as long as the Person owning such securities has no other
material connection or relationship with such competitor; provided, further,
that the Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be deemed to be in violation
of this Section 5.08 as a result of (i) performing their obligations under
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) acquiring any Person or
business that engages in the Business so long as (1) the Business contributed
less than 25% or more of the average total annual revenue of such Person or
business for the two fiscal years prior to the time of the acquisition and (2)
the total annual revenue derived from the Business of all Persons or
businesses acquired pursuant to the exception in this clause (ii) since the
Closing Date remains less than $75 million, (iii) providing telecommunication
infrastructure services pursuant to the contracts or agreements, in each case
identified in Section 5.08(a) of the Disclosure Schedule until the expiration
or termination of such contracts or agreement in accordance with its existing
terms with respect to scope and territory (iv) any other services performed
for any telecommunications customer(s) contributing revenues not in excess of
$10 million in any fiscal year of Quanta, and (v) as contemplated by the
Restructuring Transactions.

  

  

(b) The Sellers acknowledge that the covenants of the Sellers set forth in
this Section 5.08 are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for
the agreement of the Sellers to comply with these covenants, the Purchaser
would not have entered into this Agreement. The Sellers agree that the
duration and scope of the non-competition provision set forth in this Section
5.08 are reasonable. In the event that any court determines that the duration
or scope of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.08, or both, is
unreasonable and that such provision is to that extent unenforceable, the
parties hereto agree that the provision shall remain in full force and effect
for the greatest time period and in the greatest scope that would not render
it unenforceable. The parties acknowledge and agree that because it would be
impossible to measure the Purchaser's economic losses resulting from a breach
of this Section 5.08 and because such a breach would result in immediate and
irreparable damage to the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions of this Section 5.08 by means of injunctions,
restraining orders and other equitable Actions.

  

  

SECTION 5.09 Release of Indemnity Obligations. (a) From and after the Closing,
each Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates (excluding the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries), hereby releases and forever
discharges the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries, and each of their
respective individual, joint or mutual, past and present officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents, successors and assigns, in their
respective capacities as such (collectively, the "Acquired Company
Releasees"), from any and all claims, demands, actions, obligations,
contracts, agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever, whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in equity, which any of the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries) now has, have ever had or may hereafter have
against the respective Acquired Company Releasees arising prior to or
contemporaneously with the Closing or on account of or arising out of any
matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the
Closing, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.09(a) shall
in any way limit or otherwise restrict any rights the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates may have against the Purchaser or Dycom or any of their
respective Affiliates arising out of, relating to or in connection with this
Agreement, the License Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or those contracts or arrangements
set forth in Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing, each of the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries hereby releases and forever discharges the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, and each of their respective individual, joint or
mutual, past and present officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents, successors and assigns in their respective capacities as such
(collectively, the "Seller Releasees") from any and all claims, demands,
actions, obligations, contracts, agreements, debts and Liabilities whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at Law and in equity,
which any such Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries now has, have ever had or
may hereafter have against the respective Seller Releasees arising prior to or
contemporaneously with the Closing or on account of or arising out of any
matter, cause or event occurring contemporaneously with or prior to the
Closing, whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted after, the
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.09(b) shall
in any way limit or otherwise restrict any rights the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates may have against the Sellers or their Affiliates arising out of,
relating to or in connection with this Agreement, the License Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or
those contracts or arrangements set forth in Section 5.10 of the Disclosure
Schedule.

  

  

SECTION 5.10 Intercompany Arrangements. At or prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall cause any contract or arrangement that is disclosed (or should
have been disclosed) in Section 3.16(a)(viii) of the Disclosure Schedule,
other than those contracts or arrangements set forth in Section 5.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule, to be terminated or otherwise amended or modified to
exclude any Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries as a party thereto, in each
case to the extent that Dycom and the Purchaser have satisfied their
obligations pursuant to Section 5.15 with respect to any such contracts,
agreements or arrangements that constitute Credit Support Instruments.

  

  

SECTION 5.11 Transition Services. Following the Closing, the Sellers shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries
certain services that are currently provided by the Sellers and its Affiliates
to their Business, all as more fully set forth in a transition services
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the
"Transition Services Agreement") to be entered into by the Sellers, Dycom and
the Purchaser as of the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.12 Financial Statements. (a) The Sellers hereby consent to the
inclusion or incorporation by reference of the Audited Financial Statements
and Unaudited Financial Statements in any registration statement, offering
memorandum, report or other filing of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
as to which the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates reasonably determines that
such financial statements are required to be included or incorporated by
reference to satisfy any rule or regulation of the SEC or to satisfy relevant
disclosure obligations under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or as
otherwise necessary in connection with the Financing. The Sellers shall use
reasonable efforts to cause their independent accountant to consent to the
inclusion or incorporation by reference of its audit opinion with respect to
any of the financial statements of the Acquired Companies in any such
registration statement, offering memorandum, report or other filing of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, and the Sellers shall use their reasonable
efforts to cause representation letters, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, to be executed and delivered by its independent
accountants in connection with obtaining any such consent.

  

  

(b) The Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Purchaser
in connection with the preparation by the Purchaser of any pro forma financial
statements of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that are derived in part
from the financial statements of the Acquired Companies that the Purchaser or
its Affiliates reasonably determines are required to be included or
incorporated by reference in any registration statement, report or other
filing of the Purchaser or its Affiliates to satisfy any rule or regulation of
the SEC or to satisfy relevant disclosure obligations under the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act or as otherwise reasonably necessary in connection with
the Financing.

  

  

(c) To the extent not previously paid or reimbursed pursuant to the terms of
the Letter of Intent, Dycom shall promptly pay or reimburse the Sellers, as
Quanta may direct, for (i) all fees, disbursements, costs and expenses
incurred by the Sellers' third party accountants in connection with the
Unaudited Financial Statements and Audited Financial Statements (including,
without limitation, auditor comfort letters and consents) in an amount not to
exceed $1,000,000 and (ii) specific incentive compensation amounts set forth
on Section 5.12(c) of the Disclosure Schedule paid to certain personnel of the
Acquired Companies for the purpose of completing the Unaudited Financial
Statements and Audited Financial Statements and other matters related to the
transactions contemplated hereby in an amount not to exceed $200,000.

  

  

SECTION 5.13 Financing. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall provide, and
shall use reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives and
advisors, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors, to
provide, customary cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing (provided that, for purposes of this Section 5.13, the Financing
shall include, and the obligations under this Section 5.13 shall also be
applicable with respect to, required SEC reporting obligations of Purchaser
subsequent to the Closing, and any offering of "high yield" debt financing
consummated, in each case within six months of the Closing Date), as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchaser, including: (i) causing the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries to execute and deliver customary guarantee, pledge
and security documents or other definitive financing documents or other
certificates, legal opinions and documents as may be reasonably requested by
the Purchaser, provided, however, that no obligation of any of the Acquired
Companies or Subsidiaries, under any such document or agreement, as
applicable, is effective until the Closing; (ii) furnishing the Purchaser and
its financing sources with the most recent combined financial statements,
financial data and other information of the Acquired Companies reasonably
requested by the Purchaser or its financing sources in connection with the
Financing;

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

(iii) assisting any financing sources in the preparation of (A) one or more
customary offering documents in connection with the Financing in form and
substance that is customary for registration statements filed with the SEC and
(B) customary materials with respect to the Acquired Companies for inclusion
in rating agency presentations; (iv) using reasonable efforts to obtain
accountants' comfort letters as reasonably requested by the Purchaser; (v)
taking such corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of Closing)
reasonably required to permit the consummation of the Financing; (vi)
cooperating reasonably with the financing sources' due diligence of the
Acquired Companies and their Business and (vii) taking other actions
reasonably requested by the Purchaser and/or its financing sources in
connection with the Financing; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Sellers,
the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries and (y) none of the Sellers at any
time or the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall
be required to (1) pay any commitment or other fee, (2) incur any liability or
obligation under any indenture, loan agreement or any related document or any
other agreement or document related to the Financing or (3) incur any other
liability or obligation in connection with the Financing. Any information
provided by the parties hereto in connection with the Financing shall be
prepared in good faith and shall be free of any material misstatements or
omissions. The Purchaser and Dycom shall promptly upon request by the Sellers,
reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Sellers in connection with cooperation provided for in this
Section 5.13 and execute, deliver and provide such documentation as the
Sellers may reasonably request in connection with therewith.

  

  

SECTION 5.14 Vehicle Leases. Each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and Dycom
and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall cause, at the Closing, (a) each
Leased Vehicle to be sold by the respective lessor of such Leased Vehicle to
the Purchaser or one of the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries for the
applicable Buy-Out Amount and (b) upon such sale, such lessor to release the
Sellers and their Affiliates, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Sellers, from all obligations with respect to the Leased Vehicles. Section
5.14 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth, to the Sellers' Knowledge, the
respective lessor's estimated Buy-Out Amount for each Leased Vehicle as of a
date on or about the applicable dates set forth in Section 5.14 of the
Disclosure Schedule, subject to adjustments in connection with, among other
things, final vehicle mileage determinations, applicable taxes and additional
lease payments. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the actions
described in this Section 5.14 (including payment of the Buy-Out Amount) shall
be borne by Dycom and the Purchaser.

  

  

SECTION 5.15 Release from Credit Support Instruments. (a) At or prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser and Dycom shall use reasonable efforts to secure the
unconditional release, as of the Closing Date, of the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates from the credit support instruments set forth in Section
5.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Credit Support Instruments"),

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

including effecting such release by providing guarantees or other credit
support, and the Purchaser and Dycom shall use reasonable efforts to be
substituted in all respects for each Seller and each Affiliate of any Seller
that is party to the Credit Support Instrument, so that Dycom and the
Purchaser (or an Affiliate of the Purchaser) or a surety for the benefit of
Dycom and the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the obligations of
such Credit Support Instrument; provided, however, that in no event shall
reasonable efforts require the Purchaser or its Affiliates to agree (a) to
make any payment (other than in respect of replacement surety bonds obtained
on behalf of Dycom and its Affiliates or other credit support required in
connection with surety bonds of Dycom and its Affiliates, including the
Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries at and after the Closing) to obtain such
release (other than ordinary processing or administrative fees), (b) to change
the terms of any Material Contract to which such credit support applies in any
manner that is materially adverse to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) or (c) to any material restriction in the
operations of their respective businesses (including the Business) except for
covenants and restrictions that are customary in connection with such Credit
Support Instruments or such other credit support documentation contemplated by
this Section 5.15. To the extent the Purchaser is unable to obtain such
release for any Credit Support Instrument prior to the Closing, (i) Dycom and
the Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates for any and all Losses arising from or
relating to the Credit Support Instruments (it being understood that such
obligation shall not impair any rights of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to
indemnification under Article IX in respect of any such Losses) and (ii) the
Purchaser and Dycom shall continue to use reasonable efforts to secure the
unconditional release of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates from the
Credit Support Instruments as promptly as reasonably practicable. To the
Sellers' Knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to an obligation by any Person who will provide a Credit
Support Instrument to perform with respect to such Credit Support Instrument
or that would require Quanta or an Affiliate to indemnify such person with
respect to any such Credit Support Instrument, other than joint and several
obligations for expenses and obligations in the ordinary course of business
pursuant to such Credit Support Instruments. Following the Closing, Quanta
shall pay to Dycom any premium refund, rebate, credit or similar payment
received by Quanta or its Affiliates as a direct result of obtaining the
releases of the surety bonds included in the Credit Support Instruments
contemplated by this Section 5.15(a).

  

  

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to
secure the unconditional release, as of the Closing Date, of the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries from the credit support instruments set forth in
Section 5.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Other Credit Support
Instruments"), so that the Sellers (or one or more Affiliates of the Sellers
other than the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries) shall be solely
responsible for the obligations of such Other Credit Support Instrument. To
the extent the Sellers are unable to obtain such release for any such Other
Credit Support Instrument prior to the Closing, (i) the Sellers shall jointly
and severally indemnify and hold harmless Dycom, the Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies and their Affiliates for any and all Losses arising from or relating
to such Other Credit Support Instrument (it being understood that such
obligation shall not impair any rights of the Seller Indemnified Parties to
indemnification under Article IX in respect of any such Losses) and (ii) the
Sellers shall continue to use reasonable efforts to secure the unconditional
release of the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries from such Other Credit
Support Instrument as promptly as reasonably practicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 5.16 Retained Insurance Claims. Quanta shall remain liable for, and
continue to manage and pay out in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, the Retained Insurance Claims.

  

  

SECTION 5.17 Disclosure Schedule. Inclusion of any item in the Disclosure
Schedule: (i) does not represent a determination by the Sellers that such item
is material, nor shall it be deemed to establish a standard of materiality now
or in the future (it being the intent that the Sellers shall not be penalized
for having disclosed more than may be required by the applicable provision of
this Agreement), (ii) does not represent a determination by the Sellers that
such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business and (iii) shall not
constitute, or be deemed to be, an admission of liability concerning such item
by the Sellers. In addition to their obligations under Section 5.05, from time
to time prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to supplement or amend those portions of the Disclosure Schedule
that modify the representations and warranties contained in Article III other
than the Seller Fundamental Representations with respect to any matter
hereafter arising or of which it becomes aware after the date hereof (each a
"Schedule Supplement"), and each such Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to
be incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Disclosure Schedule as of
the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the event that such event,
development or occurrence which is the subject of the Schedule Supplement
constitutes or relates to something that would give rise to a right by the
Purchaser to terminate this Agreement under Section 10.01(a) and the Purchaser
has the right to, but does not elect to terminate this Agreement within five
Business Days of its receipt of such Schedule Supplement, then the Purchaser
shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived such right to terminate this
Agreement and any condition to Closing set forth in Section 8.02 with respect
to the specific matters set forth in such Schedule Supplement; provided,
further, that any Schedule Supplement provided pursuant to this Section 5.17
shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether there has been a
breach of any representation or warranty and any indemnification obligations
based on such breach of the Sellers pursuant to Article IX.

  

  

SECTION 5.18 Further Action. (a) Each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law, and to execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party and consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including taking such actions as
are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in
Article VIII.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.01, the Sellers acknowledge
and agree that certain assets that constitute Purchased Assets may not have
been transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. If, following
the Closing, the Sellers, Dycom or the Purchaser determines, acting reasonably
and in good faith, that any Purchased Assets were not so transferred, the
parties agree to cooperate to transfer such Purchased Assets to the Purchaser
without the payment of any further consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Dycom and the Purchaser acknowledge and agree that certain amounts may be
received by the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries following the Closing in
respect of the CVIN Claim. From and after the Closing, if the Acquired
Companies or Subsidiaries receives or collects any funds relating to the CVIN
Claim, Dycom shall cause such Acquired Company or Subsidiary to remit such
funds to Quanta within five Business Days after the receipt thereof; provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to any funds relating to Receivables
reflected in Net Working Capital on the Closing Statement.

  

  

(d) Quanta will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Dycom and the
Purchaser in obtaining executed Employment Documents prior to the Closing from
those individuals listed in Section 5.18(d) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

ARTICLE VI 
 

  

  

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

  

  

SECTION 6.01 Benefits. (a) Except as provided below, as of the Closing Date,
each then-current employee of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries (a
"Transferred Employee") shall cease to be covered by the Plans and shall be
covered by the employee benefit plans of Purchaser. The Transferred Employees
shall remain covered under the Plans listed in Section 6.01(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule in effect prior to the Closing (the "Specified Welfare
Plans") until the last day of the month in which the Closing occurs, after
which the Transferred Employees shall be covered by the corresponding plans of
Purchaser (if Purchaser has corresponding plans). Within 20 days following the
last day of the month in which Closing occurs, Purchaser shall make a cash
payment to the Sellers equal to the employee-paid portion of premiums or
contributions for the Specified Welfare Plans collected by Purchaser. The
medical, dental and health plans of the Purchaser applicable to each
Transferred Employee (i) shall not contain any exclusions for pre-existing
conditions (other than conditions which barred coverage under the
corresponding Plans), (ii) shall cover as of the first day of the month
following the month in which Closing occurs each Transferred Employee who was
covered by a comparable Plan immediately prior to the date of the Closing and
(iii) shall credit each Transferred Employee for the plan year of the Sellers
in which the date of the Closing occurs with all deductibles and co-payments
applicable to the portion of such plan year occurring prior to the date of the
Closing. In addition, the Purchaser shall grant each Transferred Employee full
credit for all periods of employment with the Sellers, the Acquired Companies
and the Subsidiaries for eligibility, vesting and accrual purposes under the
employee benefit plans of the Purchaser applicable to such Transferred
Employee (except that this sentence shall not obligate the Purchaser to grant
benefit accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan for any period
of employment occurring prior to the date of the Closing); provided, however,
that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit to
any such employee or the funding for any such benefit.

  

  

(b) Dycom will accept, maintain and pay out in cash, in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Plan, the 2012 incentive bonus plans that Quanta and the Acquired Companies
and Subsidiaries have in place with respect to the applicable participants at
the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2012.
The estimated amounts payable in respect of such Plans have been reflected in
the Unaudited Financial Statements and approximately 11/12ths of the aggregate
amount estimated to be paid for the year ended December 31, 2012 has been
accrued as a Current Liability of the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

ARTICLE VII 
 

  

  

TAX MATTERS

  

  

SECTION 7.01 Indemnity. (a) The Sellers agree to indemnify and hold harmless
the Purchaser, and each Acquired Company and Subsidiary against Excluded
Taxes, except to the extent that such Excluded Taxes were included in the
determination of Net Working Capital and, except as otherwise provided in this
Article VII, against any loss, damage, liability or expense, including
reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside consultants incurred in
contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes.

  

  

(b) Sellers and Purchaser agree to cause each Acquired Company and Subsidiary
to close its books or terminate its taxable period as of the end of the
Closing Date where such action is permitted under applicable Law solely as a
result of the sale of the Shares and Purchased Assets under this Agreement. In
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the date of the Closing shall be:

  

  

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than
conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.07),
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on
the date of the Closing; and

  

  

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of any Acquired Company or Subsidiary or otherwise measured by the
level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period
(or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of
such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the
date of the Closing and the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an
overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the
method employed in this paragraph (b) taking into account the type of the Tax
to which the refund relates. In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by
capital (including net worth or long term debt) or intangibles, any amount
thereof required to be allocated under this Section 7.01(b) shall be computed
by reference to the level of such items on the date of the Closing. All
determinations necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in
a manner consistent with prior practice of the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amount of any
expenses or costs (including any compensation or bonuses) incurred by the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, in each case to the extent
deductible by the Acquired Companies or the Subsidiaries in a taxable period
ending on the Closing Date under applicable Law, that are (i) paid by the
Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) paid
by Sellers (whether before or after the Closing) or (iii) taken into account
in determination of the amount of the Purchase Price (which Purchase Price
would have been higher if it were not taken into account) shall be taken as a
deduction on the Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries that
are filed for the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and, in the case
of any Tax Returns filed for a Straddle Period, such deductions shall be
allocated to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period to the extent not
prohibited by Law. For this purpose, the safe harbor of Revenue Procedure
2011-29, 2011-18 IRB 746 shall be applied in determining the deductible amount
of "success-based fees."

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
Sellers shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification for Non-Income
Taxes pursuant to Section 7.01(a), unless and until the aggregate amount of
Non-Income Taxes which may be recovered from the Sellers equals or exceeds
$100,000 whereupon Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries shall be
entitled to indemnification only to the extent of the amount, if any, that
exceeds $100,000, (ii) Sellers shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification for Taxes attributable to actions taken by, or at the
direction of, Dycom, the Purchaser or any of their Affiliates that are
effective on the Closing Date and not contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
the maximum amount of Non-Income Taxes which may be recovered from Sellers
under this Section 7.01 shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price.

  

  

SECTION 7.02 Returns and Payments. (a) After the Closing, the Sellers, at
their sole expense, shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form
to the appropriate Governmental Authority (or cause to be prepared and filed
or so furnished) in a timely manner all Income Tax Returns relating to the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on the
Closing Date. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, or to the extent
the Acquired Companies determine that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and
filed without being subject to penalties, such Income Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Sellers, the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries. With respect to such Income Tax
Return that is a Stand-Alone Return and the portion of any such Income Tax
Return that is not a Stand-Alone Return that pertains to the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries, Sellers shall provide Purchaser and its
authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Tax Return (or
portion thereof, in the case of a Tax Return that is not a Stand-Alone
Return), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at
least 20 Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof)
for the filing of such Tax Return, and Purchaser and its authorized
representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return
prior to the filing of such Tax Return. The Sellers shall take into account
the comments of the Purchaser in good faith.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.02(a), Purchaser, at its sole
expense, shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the
appropriate Governmental Authority (or cause to be prepared and filed or so
furnished) in a timely manner all other Tax Returns relating to the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period or any Straddle
Period that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or to the extent the Acquired Companies
determine that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed without being
subject to penalties, such Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies and the
Subsidiaries shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices
employed with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries.
Purchaser shall provide Sellers and their authorized representatives with a
copy of such completed Tax Returns that are Income Tax Returns and, if
applicable, a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Income Tax
Return that is allocable to Sellers pursuant to Section 7.01, together with
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20 Business Days
prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such
Income Tax Return, and Sellers and their authorized representatives shall have
the right to review and comment on such Income Tax Return and statement prior
to the filing of such Income Tax Return. The Purchaser shall take into account
the comments of the Sellers in good faith. With respect to any Non-Income Tax
Returns prepared by Purchaser, Purchaser shall provide Sellers and their
authorized representatives with a copy of such Non-Income Tax Returns if such
Non-Income Tax Returns show a Tax due and owing allocable to Seller under
Section 7.01 (along with a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on
such Non-Income Tax Return that is allocable to Sellers pursuant to Section
7.01), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least
20 Business Days, if practical, prior to the due date (including any extension
thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and, in no event, later than 10
days after such Tax Return has been filed.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all unpaid Taxes shown due and
payable on any Tax Returns prepared and filed by Sellers pursuant to Section
7.02(a) with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries, except to
the extent that such unpaid Taxes were included in the determination of Net
Working Capital. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all unpaid Taxes
shown due and payable on Tax Returns prepared and filed by Purchaser pursuant
to Section 7.02(b) with respect to the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries
(subject to its right of indemnification from the Sellers under Section 7.01
by the date set forth in Section 7.05 for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or
attributable to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period pursuant to
Sections 7.01(a) and 7.01(b), provided that the limitations of Section 7.01(c)
shall not apply).

  

  

SECTION 7.03 Refunds. Any Tax refund or overpayment that is applied as a
credit (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Period or the pre-Closing portion of
a Straddle Period shall be the property of the Sellers, and if received by, or
credited to, the Purchaser, an Affiliate of the Purchaser, any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary shall be paid over promptly to the Sellers.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any Tax refund (or equivalent benefit to
the Sellers through a reduction in Tax liability) for any Pre-Closing Period
arising out of the carryback of a loss or credit incurred by any Acquired
Company or Subsidiary in any Post-Closing Period, which under applicable Law
is required to be carried back to a Pre-Closing Period, shall be the property
of the Purchaser and, if received by the Sellers or an Affiliate of the
Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to the Purchaser; (b) if a Governmental
Authority subsequently disallows any refund with respect to which the Sellers
has received a payment pursuant to this Section 7.03, the Sellers shall
promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to the Purchaser the amount of such refund
to the extent disallowed (including any interest with respect thereto) and (c)
if a Governmental Authority subsequently disallows any refund with respect to
which the Purchaser has received a payment pursuant to this Section 7.03(a) by
reason of an adjustment to the carryback loss or credit, then Purchaser shall
promptly pay (or cause to be paid) to the Sellers the amount of such refund to
the extent such Governmental Authority requires the Sellers to pay the amount
disallowed (including any interest with respect thereto). Unless otherwise
required under applicable Law, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries, not to carry back any loss or credit incurred by
any Acquired Company or Subsidiary in any Post-Closing Period to a Pre-Closing
Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 7.04 Contests. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Sellers in writing of any written notice of the commencement of any
Action or proposed assessment or Claim made against, or with respect to, the
Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies or Subsidiaries which (i) relates
to a Pre-Closing Period or a Straddle Period of any Acquired Company or
Subsidiary or (ii) if determined adversely to the taxpayer, could be grounds
for indemnification under this Article VII (a "Tax Action"); provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice will not affect the Purchaser's
right to indemnification under this Article VII except to the extent, if any,
that, but for such failure, the Sellers could have avoided all or a portion of
the Tax liability in question.

  

  

(b) In the case of a Tax Action (other than a Tax Action that relates to a
Straddle Period), provided that, and only to the extent that, the Sellers
acknowledge in writing their liability under this Agreement to hold the
Purchaser, the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries harmless against the
amount of any adjustment which may be made as a result of such audit or
proceeding that relates to Pre-Closing Periods to the extent so provided under
Section 7.01, the Sellers shall have the right, at their expense, to control
the conduct of the Tax Action, provided that the Sellers shall keep the
Purchaser informed as to the progress of the Tax Action in a timely manner.
The Purchaser may also, at its expense, participate in, but not control, any
such Tax Action to the extent that it is related to a Stand-Alone Return or a
Non-Income Tax Return and, if the Sellers do not assume the defense of a Tax
Action, the Purchaser may defend the same in such manner as it may deem
appropriate. In the case of a Tax Action that relates to a Straddle Period,
the Purchaser shall have the right, at its expense, to control the Tax Action;
the Sellers may also, at their expense, participate in, but not control, any
such Tax Action and, if the Purchaser does not assume the defense of any such
Tax Action, the Sellers may defend the same in such manner as they may deem
appropriate.

  

  

(c) In the event that there is a Tax Action that involves (i) the commencement
of a tax examination or audit of one or more Pre-Closing Periods and either a
Straddle Period and/or one or more Post-Closing Periods and (ii) the same type
of Non-Income Tax (or Income Tax, if no Section 338(h)(10) Election was
allowed by the relevant Governmental Authority or a Governmental Authority is
challenging a Section 338(h)(10) Election) is at issue with respect to all
such periods, then, the Sellers and the Purchaser may participate in the audit
or examination and the audit or examination shall be jointly controlled by
Sellers and Purchaser with respect to the Non-Income Tax (or Income Tax) at
issue, provided, however, that at the point that it can be reasonably
determined which party would have the burden of the greater portion of the sum
of any proposed adjustments and any corresponding adjustments for such
periods, then that party shall control the audit and examination

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.04, with
respect to any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date, neither the
Purchaser nor the Sellers shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle
any Tax Action which would adversely affect the other party for such taxable
period or a subsequent taxable period without the written consent of the other
party, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to cooperate, and the Purchaser agrees to
cause the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the defense
against or compromise of any Tax Action.

SECTION 7.05 Time of Payment. Payment by the Sellers of any amounts due under
this Article VII in respect of Taxes shall be made (a) at least three Business
Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax Return
required to be filed by the Purchaser for which the Sellers are responsible
under Sections 7.01(a) and 7.01(b) without regard to whether the Tax Return
shows overall net income or loss for such period or (b) within ten Business
Days following an agreement between the Sellers and the Purchaser that an
indemnity amount is payable, a non-appealable final assessment of a Tax by a
Governmental Authority, or a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of
the Code. If liability under this Article VII is in respect of costs or
expenses other than Taxes, payment by the Sellers of any amounts due under
this Article VII shall be made within ten Business Days after the date when
the Sellers have been notified by the Purchaser that the Sellers have a
liability for a determinable amount under this Article VII and are provided
with calculations or other materials supporting such liability.

  

  

SECTION 7.06 Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall provide each other with such cooperation and information as
either of them reasonably may request of the other (and the Purchaser shall
cause the Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation
and information) in (a) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund, (b) determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes,
or (c) participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect
of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of
relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof to the extent related to the Acquired
Companies and the Subsidiaries, together with related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Governmental
Authorities. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall make themselves (and their
respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this
Section 7.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02, each
of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, work papers and
all material records or other documents in its possession (or in the
possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Acquired
Companies or any Subsidiary for any taxable period that includes the Closing
Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration
of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns
and other documents relate, without regard to extensions and (ii) six years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before the Sellers or the Purchaser shall dispose of any such documents
in its possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates), the other party
shall be given an opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove
and retain all or any part of such documents that relate solely to the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries as such other party may select (at
such other party's expense). Any information obtained under this Section 7.06
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or handling a Tax Action.

SECTION 7.07 Conveyance Taxes. Any Conveyance Taxes imposed in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one-half by
Sellers and one-half by Purchaser. The Sellers, after the review and consent
by the Purchaser, shall file such applications and documents as shall permit
any such Conveyance Taxes to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing
in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser
shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable
the Sellers to comply with the foregoing. The Purchaser shall complete and
execute a resale or other exemption certificate with respect to the inventory
items sold hereunder, and shall provide the Seller with an executed copy
thereof.

  

  

SECTION 7.08 Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) Where permitted under applicable
Law, Purchaser and Sellers agree to make a joint election under Sections
338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to the sale of the Shares under
this Agreement for each Acquired Company and each of its Subsidiaries
(together, the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). The Purchaser and the Sellers
shall cooperate to identify the states and localities for which a Section
338(h)(10) Election would be made. At the Closing or, if the Purchaser and the
Sellers identify a state or locality for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election
would be made after the Closing, promptly after such identification, the
Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023,
Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases,
and any corresponding forms under comparable provisions of applicable state or
local Law with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections duly executed by
Sellers. As requested from time to time by Sellers or Purchaser (whether
before, at, or after the Closing), the Sellers and the Purchaser shall assist
each other in, and shall provide the necessary information to each other, in
connection with the preparation of any other forms and documentation required
to effect valid and timely Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Purchaser shall
be responsible for the timely filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections with
the appropriate Governmental Authorities and shall provide the Sellers with a
copy of the Section 338(h)(10) Election forms as filed within five Business
Days after filing. The Purchaser and the Sellers shall take all reasonably
necessary steps and cooperate in good faith, including the exchange of
information, to effect and preserve valid and timely Section 338(h)(10)
Elections. Unless required by applicable Law, (1) each of the parties shall,
and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, report, act and file
all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections,
and (2) no party shall take, or shall cause any of its Affiliates to take, any
position that is inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

  

  

(b) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Acquired Companies, and
among the assets of the Acquired Companies, as of the Closing in determining
"aggregate deemed sales price" and "adjusted gross-up basis" (as defined in
the Code and Regulations) that results from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections
in the manner described in this Section 7.08(b) ("Purchase Price Allocation").
Within 45 Business Days after the Closing, the Purchaser shall provide the
Sellers with a proposed Purchase Price Allocation for the Sellers' review and
comment. If the Sellers do not provide any comments to the Purchaser in
writing within 10 Business Days following delivery by the Purchaser of the
proposed Purchase Price Allocation, then the Purchase Price Allocation
proposed by the Purchaser shall be deemed to be final and binding absent
manifest error. If, however, the Sellers submit comments to the Purchaser
within such 10 Business Day period, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences within 20 Business Days.
The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that, unless otherwise required by Law,
the purchase and sale of the Acquired Companies will be reported for all Tax
purposes in a manner that is consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation as
finally agreed by the parties hereto, and that none of them (nor any of their
respective Affiliates) will take any position inconsistent therewith on any
Tax Return or otherwise. If the Sellers and the Purchaser are unable to reach
agreement on the Purchase Price Allocation within such 20 Business Day period,
then each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall be responsible for
determining its own Purchase Price Allocation for use on its Tax Returns in
accordance with applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 7.09 Miscellaneous. (a) The Sellers and the Purchaser agree to treat
all payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other
(including any payments to any Acquired Company or Subsidiary) under this
Article VII, under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any
misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or covenants as adjustments to
the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax purposes and that such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the Laws
of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which case such payments
shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the relevant party on an
after-Tax basis.

  

  

(b) All payments payable under any tax sharing agreement or arrangement
between the Sellers and any Acquired Company or Subsidiary for any taxable
period ending on or prior to the date of the Closing shall be calculated on a
basis consistent with past practice and shall be payable in full prior to the
Closing. Any such tax sharing agreement or arrangement between the Sellers and
any Acquired Company or Subsidiary shall be terminated prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of the Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser, the
Acquired Companies and the Subsidiaries pursuant to this Article VII, and the
representations and warranties dealing with Tax matters, including those
contained in Section 3.24, shall terminate at the close of business on the
60th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof).

  

  

(d) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except for changes to
comply with or adopt the provisions in the temporary regulations described in
Revenue Procedure 2012-19, 2012-14 IRB 689 and Revenue Procedure 2012-20,
2012-14 IRB 700, from and after the date of this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, make, or cause or
permit to be made, any Tax election that would have an adverse effect on any
Acquired Company or Subsidiary for any taxable period ending after the Closing
Date.

  

  

(e) Except as otherwise required under applicable Law, or in settlement of a
Tax audit or similar proceeding initiated by a Governmental Authority, none of
Dycom, the Purchaser, their Affiliates, the Acquired Companies and
Subsidiaries shall amend any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies or
Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any and all Tax
matters shall be governed solely by this Article VII and Section 9.02(c).

SECTION 9.04 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, except with respect to claims relating
to Taxes: (a) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or 9.03(a) (other than
indemnification in respect of Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser
Fundamental Representations, respectively) unless and until the aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Indemnifying
Party equals or exceeds $2.75 million whereupon the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable for indemnification for the full amount of such Losses; (b) the
maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an
Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the causes set forth in
Section 9.02(a) or 9.03(a) (other than indemnification in respect of Seller
Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental Representations,
respectively), as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to 20% of the
Purchase Price; (c) the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising out of or resulting from the
causes set forth in Section 9.02(a) or 9.03(a) for indemnification in respect
of Seller Fundamental Representations or Purchaser Fundamental
Representations, respectively, as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to
the Purchase Price; (d) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a) or 9.03(a), other than for indemnifiable
Losses in excess of $20,000 resulting from a single claim or aggregate claims
arising from the same facts, event or circumstances; (e) the maximum amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from an Indemnifying Party arising
out of or resulting from the causes set forth in Section 9.02(b) or 9.03(b),
as the case may be, shall be an amount equal to the Purchase Price; and (f)
the Sellers shall have no Liability for any Losses in respect of the
Purchaser's Financing with respect to a breach of the representation and
warranty contained in Section 3.08(b) other than taking such action as is
necessary to make such representation and warranty accurate, and in any event
the Sellers shall have no Liability for any such Losses relating to market
conditions or market risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of
this Section 9.04 shall not apply to indemnification in respect of Taxes,
Section 5.15, or the obligations of Dycom and the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 9.03(d).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 9.05 Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims. (a) An Indemnified Party
shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of any matter that an Indemnified
Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, within 30 days of such determination,
stating the amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof,
and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of
which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises.

  

  

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, demand
or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it or which may give rise
to a claim for Loss under this Article IX, promptly, but in no event later
than 30 days after the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim; provided,
however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure and shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or Liability that
it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article IX. If
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through
counsel of its choice if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that if there exists a
conflict of interest that the Indemnified Party's outside counsel shall have
advised the Indemnified Party would make it inappropriate for the same counsel
to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party so determines counsel is
required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that
the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and disbursements
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction in
any single Action. In the event that the Indemnifying Party exercises the
right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as
provided above, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified
Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to direct the defense of any such
claim or proceeding, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
settle any Third Party Claim for which it obtains an unconditional release of
the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim
or to which settlement the Indemnified Party consents in writing (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If, within 30 days after the
receipt of the notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party that it elects to undertake the defense of
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest,
settle or compromise such Third Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any
right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
that no Indemnified Party may settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder under any circumstances without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability arising out of such
claim. In such event, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party,
at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials
and information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the
Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.05 to the
contrary, if a Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Action or any Action seeking equitable or remedial relief, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to jointly control the defense thereof
with the Indemnifying Party for so long as such Action is continuing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except for the right to
specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement as provided in Section
11.10 and with respect to common law fraud (excluding any concept of
"constructive fraud"), following the Closing, the provisions of Section 5.15,
Article VII and this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
the Seller Indemnified Parties and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any
Loss and any and all claims arising under, out of, or related to this
Agreement or the sale and purchase of the Acquired Companies and Subsidiaries,
and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VII or
this Article IX or the provisions in Section 5.15. The provisions of this
Section 9.06, together with the limited remedies provided in Article VII and
this Article IX, were specifically bargained for between Dycom, the Purchaser
and the Sellers The Sellers have specifically relied upon the provisions of
this Section 9.06, together with the limited remedies provided in Article VII
and this Article IX, in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to
provide the specific representations and warranties set forth herein.

  

  

SECTION 9.06 Certain Other Indemnification Matters.

  

  

(a) The Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall
be reduced by any third party insurance proceeds or other payments actually
received by the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of any such Losses net of
reasonable expenses incurred in receiving such proceeds or payments (including
any reasonably documented increase in insurance premiums that may arise in
connection with the payment of any claim). Any Indemnified Party that becomes
aware of Losses for which it intends to seek indemnification hereunder shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts to which it
reasonably may be entitled under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution
or other similar agreements for any Losses.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnifying Party be liable to any Indemnified Party for any punitive
damages (other than punitive damages actually paid in respect of a Third Party
Claim) or loss of business reputation or opportunity, or any damages based on
any type of multiple relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Each Indemnified Party shall
take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Loss actually suffered by such party.

TERMINATION

  

  

SECTION 10.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the Purchaser if (i) between the date hereof and the Closing, an event
or condition occurs that has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
either of the Sellers shall have breached any of their representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VIII, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within 10 Business Days after the
giving of written notice by the Purchaser specifying such breach;

  

  

(b) by the Sellers if Dycom or the Purchaser shall have breached any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

Article VIII, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 10 Business
Days after the giving of written notice by the Sellers specifying such breach;

  

  

(c) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred by February 1, 2013 (the "End Date"); provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.01(c) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date; provided, however, that if
the Marketing Period has commenced prior to the End Date and has not been
completed by the End Date, then the End Date shall be extended to the fifth
Business Day after the date on which the Marketing Period is completed;

  


 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

72

contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; or

  

  

(e) by the mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Purchaser.

reimbursement provisions of Section 5.13, and Sections 11.01, 11.09, and 11.15

shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason in accordance
with the terms thereof.

SECTION 11.03 Public Announcements. None of the parties hereto shall make, or
cause to be made, any press release or public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate
with any news media without the prior written consent of the other parties
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless otherwise
required by Law or applicable stock exchange rule or regulation (based upon
the advice of counsel), and the parties hereto shall cooperate as to the
timing and contents of any such press release, public announcement or
communication.

  

  

SECTION 11.04 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance

materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  

  

SECTION 11.05 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, the
License Agreement, the Non-Disclosure Agreement and the Antitrust
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the sale and purchase of the Acquired Companies and
Subsidiaries and the other subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Sellers
and the Purchaser with respect to the sale and purchase of the Acquired
Companies and Subsidiaries and the other subject matter hereof and thereof
(including the Letter of Intent).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 11.06 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the express written consent of Quanta and the
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of
Quanta or the Purchaser) and any such assignment or attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to one or more Affiliates of the Purchaser
without the consent of Quanta, provided that any such assignment by the
Purchaser shall not relieve the Purchaser of any liability or obligation
hereunder.

  

  

SECTION 11.07 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except
(a) by an instrument in writing signed by, or on behalf of, the Sellers and
the Purchaser or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 11.08.

  

  

SECTION 11.08 Waiver. The Sellers, on the one hand, and Dycom and the
Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party contained herein, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party contained herein or in any certificate delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements of the
other party or conditions to such party's obligations contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. The failure of the Sellers or the Purchaser to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any of
such rights.

  

  

SECTION 11.09 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the provisions of
Article IX relating to indemnified parties and pursuant to Section 11.15, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person, including any union or any employee or former employee of the Sellers,
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever,
including any rights of employment for any specified period, under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that they would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that
any breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which the parties hereto may be entitled, at Law or in equity,
they shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement (including
Sections 5.07 and 5.08) by a decree of specific performance and to seek
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 11.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All Actions arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively
in any New York federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City
of New York, provided, however, that if such federal court does not have
jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in any New York state court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of
The City of New York. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties
hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state
court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the
purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by
any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of
motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or
that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by any of the above named courts.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 11.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of the other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it has been induced to enter into this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.12.

  

  

SECTION 11.13 Currency. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all
references to currency, monetary values and dollars set forth herein shall
mean United States (U.S.) dollars and all payments hereunder shall be made in
United States dollars.

  

  

SECTION 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

SECTION 11.15 Non-Recourse. (a) All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, at law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto. No Person who is not a named party to this
Agreement, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any
named party to this Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, at law or in equity, or based upon
any theory that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its
owners or affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in
connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation or execution;
and each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are
expressly intended as third party beneficiaries of this provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Sellers and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall not have
any rights or claims against any of the commercial banks, investment banks or
other financial institutions providing Financing to the Purchaser or Dycom in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each a "Debt
Financing Party") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments or
agreements of such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise. No Debt Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in
contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto
under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the performance of any financing
commitments of such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
claims or causes of action brought against any Debt Financing Party in its
capacity as such will not be brought in any forum other than the federal and
New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of
New York and shall be governed by the law of the State of New York. It is
further agreed that the Debt Financing Parties are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of this Section
11.15(b).
