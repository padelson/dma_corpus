iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of June 12, 2013, by and among BELO CORP., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "), GANNETT CO., INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Gannett_
"), and DELTA ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Gannett (" _Merger Sub_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Gannett, Merger Sub and the
Company have each approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Gannett in accordance with Delaware General Corporation Law (the
" _DGCL_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions
approving and declaring the advisability of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii) directed that
this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their
approval, and (iv) adopted resolutions recommending that the stockholders of
the Company approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Gannett has unanimously approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
as a condition and inducement to Gannetts willingness to enter into this
Agreement, each of the members of the Board of Directors and executive
officers of the Company are entering into voting and support agreements with
Gannett, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Related Agreements_ "), pursuant to which they, among other things, agree to
vote all of their Common Shares (as defined below) in favor of the Merger and
the approval of this Agreement; 

WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties
further desire that, simultaneous with the consummation of the Merger, there
shall be a restructuring of certain of the Companys media holdings and,
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Gannett has
entered into a series of Asset Purchase Agreements with the Restructuring
Assignees (collectively, the " _Restructuring Agreements_ "), which
contemplate that, subject to the prior consent of the FCC, simultaneously with
the consummation of the Merger, the applicable Company Subsidiaries will join
in such Restructuring Agreements and thereupon shall assign, transfer and
convey to the Restructuring Assignees contemplated therein certain assets,
including the applicable FCC Licenses, of broadcast television station
properties of the Company designated herein and therein as the "Assigned
Stations" (collectively, the " _Restructuring_ "); WHEREAS, this Agreement and the Restructuring Agreements contemplate that the
Company and those certain buyers of the Assigned Stations under the
Restructuring Agreements will file applications with the FCC seeking consent
to the Restructuring; and

WHEREAS, the Restructuring is an integral element of, and a condition to, each
partys respective agreement to enter into the Merger, and accordingly, the
Restructuring and the Merger (collectively, the " _Transaction_ ") will be
conditioned upon one another and will be consummated simultaneously.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.
The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger, and the separate
corporate existence of the Company with all its properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by
the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the
Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_
". As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its existence as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Gannett under the laws of the State of Delaware and shall
succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in
accordance with the DGCL. 

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Nixon Peabody LLP, 401 9th
Street NW, Suite 900, Washington, DC 20004, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on
the second (2nd) Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ have been fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) in accordance with this Agreement,
or at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and
Gannett may agree in writing (such date, the " _Closing Date_ "). As promptly
as possible on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), together with any
required related certificates, filings and recordings, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger is
properly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such
later date and time as the Company and Gannett may agree upon and as is set
forth in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, at

 



2  the Effective Time all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and obligations of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. At the Effective Time:

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its
entirety as provided in the Certificate of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit
B_ , and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until subsequently
amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL.

 

(b) Merger Subs by-laws in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Surviving Corporations by-laws, until subsequently amended in
accordance with their terms, the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. Subject to applicable Law, from and
after the Effective Time, (a) the individuals listed on _Section 1.5(a)_ of
the Gannett Disclosure Letter shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and (b) the individuals listed on _Section 1.5(a)_ of the Gannett
Disclosure Letter shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case, until their respective successors have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporations Organizational Documents and the
DGCL.

 

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holder of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) Except for Dissenting Shares or as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_, each
Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically and with no further action be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with this _Article II_ , $13.75 in cash, without
interest (the per share cash consideration to be issued to the holders of
such Common Shares, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each Common Share so
converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and each uncertificated Common Share represented by book-
entry (each, an " _Uncertificated Share_ ") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate or transfer of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to _Section
2.2_.

 

(b) Each Common Share (i) held by the Company as treasury stock, (ii) owned by
any Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) owned by Gannett or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case immediately before the
Effective Time, shall

 



3  automatically be cancelled and retired and cease to exist and no Merger
Consideration shall be delivered as provided herein and no other payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender; Closing of Books_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Gannett shall designate, or shall cause to be
designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Gannett), a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective
Time, Gannett shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent,
separate and apart from its other funds, for the benefit of holders of Common
Shares, cash in an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration which
such holders are entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). Gannett and the
Company shall bear equally all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

(b) The Merger Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent in (i) direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the
full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide
for payment of all principal and interest, (iii) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or (iv) such other
investments as may be provided by Gannett, or a combination of the foregoing,
as directed by and for the benefit of Gannett; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of
Common Shares following completion of the Merger pursuant to this _Article
II_ , and Gannett shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Merger
Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Gannetts obligations
under this _Article II_. Any and all interest and other income earned on the
Merger Fund shall promptly be paid to Gannett.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time, Gannett shall
instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Shares
that have converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by Gannett
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(d) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates for cancellation,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of
Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the
aggregate Merger Consideration in 

 



4  respect thereof, and the Certificates so surrendered and Uncertificated
Shares so delivered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or due
delivery of the Uncertificated Shares.

(e) In the event any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or the
Uncertificated Shares so delivered are registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof that
such Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly delivered for
transfer and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at
all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender or delivery the Merger Consideration, subject to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized by the
Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Any
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or the
delivery of any Uncertificated Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share and the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

(f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time thereafter on the
records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be marked canceled and exchanged as
provided in and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article
II_.

 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, mutilated or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Gannett, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate or such other indemnity as may reasonably be
requested by Gannett, the Paying Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed Certificate. Delivery
of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be deemed delivery of a
Certificate with respect to the relevant Common Shares for purposes of this
_Article II_.

(h) Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares and other eligible Persons in accordance
with this _Article II_ for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such holder who
has not previously complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable, for payment of any such holders claim for the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Merger Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Common Shares
as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property

 



5  of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of Gannett
or the Paying Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to
any record or beneficial owner of Common Shares for any such shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Options and RSUs_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Gannett, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any
Common Shares or Options, each Option (whether vested or unvested) shall be
fully vested upon the Closing. At the Effective Time, each Option shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance
with _Section 2.6_ with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying
(i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price per share of such Option by (ii) the number of Common Shares
for which such Option may be exercised.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Gannett, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any
Common Shares or RSUs, each RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall be fully
vested upon Closing, which full vesting, in the case of any performance-based
RSUs with an open performance period as of the Effective Time, will be
determined based on the higher of target and actual year-to-date results. At
the Effective Time, each RSU shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes
required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.6_ with respect to
such payment) equal to the Merger Consideration (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, is equal to (i) the number of Common Shares subject to such RSU
(whether or not settled in cash or Common Shares under the applicable award
agreement), multiplied by (ii) the amount of the Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Common Share), plus any accrued but unpaid dividend
equivalents to the extent accrued on such RSUs in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to the holders of
Options and RSUs the cash payments described in this  _Section 2.3_ within
ten (10) Business Days after the Closing Date; _provided_ , that if any such
payment would violate any applicable provision of Code Section 409A, then such
payment shall be made on the earliest practicable date that payment may be
made without violating any applicable provision of Code Section 409A and, from
the Closing Date through such permissible payment date, any such delayed cash
payments shall be held in a deferred compensation account for the benefit of
the individual holder and such amounts shall be credited with interest from
the Effective Time through the applicable payment date equal to the interest
rate earned by Gannett in its money market accounts.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee of the Company Board administering the Equity Incentive Plans)
shall adopt resolutions that provide that the treatment of the Options and the
RSUs as set forth in _Section 2.3_ is equitable in the circumstances.

 



6 (e) Except as may otherwise be permitted pursuant to _Section 5.1_, the
Company shall not grant any Option or RSU award on or after the date hereof.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Common Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand, and
who properly demands, appraisal of such Common Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Section, "
_Section 262_ " and, such Common Shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.1(a)_, but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262 (and, at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 and any declared but
unpaid dividends having a record date prior to the Effective Time); _provided_
, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall
cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as
provided in _Section 2.1(a)_. The Company shall notify Gannett as promptly as
reasonably practicable of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any Common Shares, and Gannett shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Gannett (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion
of the Merger Consideration held in the Merger Fund in respect of payment made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ to pay for
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Gannett upon demand.

 

Section 2.5 _Antidilution Adjustments_. In the event that, at any time from
the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of Common Shares issued and outstanding
prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Common Shares,
then the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.

Section 2.6 _Tax Withholding_. Gannett, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent each shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Common Shares, RSUs or Options such amounts
as Gannett, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
provision of Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Gannett,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and then remitted to the
relevant Taxing Authority on behalf of the former holder of Common Shares,
RSUs or Options, such withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder or former 

 



7  holder of the Common Shares, RSUs or Options in respect of which such
deduction, withholding and remittance to the relevant Taxing Authority was
made by Gannett, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case
may be. Gannett, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall, to the
extent reasonably necessary, cooperate with each other and with the former
holders of the Common Shares, RSUs or Options in the collection, preparation
and filing of any forms or other documentation relating to any claim of
exemption or relief from any requirement to withhold so as to eliminate or
minimize to the greatest extent possible any such requirement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as otherwise disclosed (i) in the Company Disclosure Letter which
shall be organized in the manner of the Sections and subsections of this
Agreement (it being understood that the disclosure of an item in a Section of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to modify and limit both (A)
the representations and warranties contained in the Section to which it
corresponds in number, and (B) any other representation and warranty of the
Company in this Agreement to the extent it is apparent from a reading of such
disclosure item that it would also qualify or apply to such other
representation and warranty), or (ii) in the SEC Reports, filed with the SEC

failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the Companys Organizational
Documents which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the Companys

of Merger pursuant to the DGCL. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,

certificate of incorporation; and (v) resolved to submit this Agreement and
the Merger to the Companys stockholders for approval, and to recommend that
the Companys stockholders approve this Agreement and the Merger (the "

rescinded, modified or withdrawn except as expressly permitted by _Section
6.4(d)_. The Stockholder Approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, is the only vote of the holders
of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve
this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger and the Restructuring.

not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
Company Subsidiary is in material violation of any provision of its

notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation, payment, acceleration or revocation under any

party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective assets or properties may be bound, (iii) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any property or asset
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (iv) assuming the Stockholder
Approval and all consents, approvals, authorizations and Permits contemplated

registrations in such Section have been made, violate or conflict with any Law
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject, except, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for violations, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, payments, accelerations, revocations, creations,
impositions or conflicts which, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 3.7 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has filed or furnished, as
applicable, all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by it to the SEC since December 31, 2010
(the " _SEC Reports_ "). As of its respective date and as of the date any
information incorporated by reference into it, each SEC Report (i) complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, applicable to such SEC Report and (ii) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, _provided_ , however that no representation is made as
to the accuracy of any financial projections or forward-looking statements,
or the completeness of any information furnished by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary to the SEC for the purpose of complying with Regulation FD
promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company has filed or duly
incorporated by reference all Contracts, Company Plans and other documents or
instruments required to be filed as exhibits to the SEC Reports. No issued and
outstanding Common Shares are entitled to rights of rescission under state or
federal securities Laws.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any notes or schedules
thereto) included in the SEC Reports have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods presented, except as
otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case of interim unaudited
financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments. The
consolidated balance sheets included in such financial statements present
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and the Company 

 



12  Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income,
consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements
of cash flows included in such financial statements present fairly in all
material respects the consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for the respective
periods indicated, except as otherwise noted therein and subject, in the case
of interim unaudited financial statements, to normal recurring year-end
adjustments. The accounting books and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in a manner that permits the
Company to prepare its consolidated financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied.

 

(c) Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2012 included in the SEC
Reports, (ii) as incurred after December 31, 2012 in the Ordinary Course of
Business and, if incurred after the date hereof, not prohibited by this
Agreement, or (iii) as incurred pursuant to this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities, Indebtedness or
obligations of any kind, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued,
contingent, matured, unmatured or otherwise, and whether due or to become due,
and whether or not required by GAAP to be recorded or reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or disclosed in the notes thereto),
and there is no existing condition or situation which could be reasonably
expected to result in any such liabilities, Indebtedness or obligations,
other than those that have not had and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on _Section 3.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any Indebtedness
evidenced by a credit agreement, note, debenture, bond or similar security
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any trade payables or
other current liabilities or obligations), other than any intercompany
Indebtedness.

(d) The Company has established and maintained a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act). Such internal controls are sufficient in all material respects
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of the Companys
financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied. The
Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
of this Agreement, to its auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (i) all identified significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting
that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls.

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and

 



13  communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(f) The Company has not received any written notice from the staff of the SEC
of any formal or informal investigations of the Company by the SEC (other than
any such investigation that has been resolved prior to the date hereof). To
the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, there are no pending (i)
formal or informal investigations of the Company by the SEC or (ii)
inspections of an audit of the Companys financial statements by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. There are no pending investigations by
the audit committee of the Company Board regarding any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has engaged in
improper or illegal accounting or auditing practices or maintains improper or
inadequate internal accounting controls. As of the date hereof, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with
respect to any of the SEC Reports. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the
date hereof, none of the SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding SEC investigation.

(g) Since December 31, 2010, each of the principal executive officers and the
principal financial officers of the Company has made all certifications
required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("
_Sarbanes-Oxley_ ") with respect to the SEC Reports and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and correct in all material
respects. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has outstanding any
"extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of Sarbanes-Oxley)
to directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.

(h) Since December 31, 2010, the Companys Chief Executive Officer has
provided unqualified annual certifications to NYSE regarding NYSEs corporate
governance listing standards. The Company is in compliance with all
applicable provisions of the listing and corporate governance rules of NYSE,
except for any non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate
(including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or Person), on the other hand). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has or, since December 31, 2010, has had any "off-balance sheet arrangement"
(as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC) or other
contingent liability where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract,
arrangement or liability is or was to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in the SEC Reports or in the financial statements of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

 



14 Section 3.8 _Proxy Statement_. At the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the Company stockholders and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, the
Proxy Statement will not contain or incorporate by reference any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
representation contained in the immediately preceding sentence will not apply
to statements or omissions included in the Proxy Statement that were
furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of Gannett or Merger Sub
expressly for inclusion therein. At the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to
the Company stockholders, the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

Section 3.9 _Compliance with Law; Permits_. The Company and each Company
Subsidiary (i) is, and at all times since December 31, 2010 has been, in
compliance with all applicable Law and (ii) has not received written notice of
any violation of any applicable Law, except for such violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (i) have all Permits required to conduct their
respective businesses as now conducted and (ii) are in compliance with all
such Permits except, in each case and in the aggregate, for noncompliance that
has not had and could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Permits of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are valid and in full force and effect and
have not been expired or been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded or
terminated, other than those that, individually and in the aggregate, have
not had and could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.10 _FCC Matters_.

(a) _Section 3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of all Station Licenses and the corresponding Company
Subsidiaries that are the holders of such Station Licenses. The Station
Licenses constitute all of the licenses, Permits and other authorizations
issued by the FCC in respect of the Stations. Such Station Licenses are in
full force and effect and have not expired or been revoked, suspended,
canceled, rescinded or terminated. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
has (i) operated each Station in compliance with the Communications Laws and
the Station Licenses in all material respects, (ii) timely filed all material
registrations and reports required to have been filed with the FCC relating to
the Station Licenses, (iii) paid or caused to be paid all FCC regulatory fees
due in respect to each Station and (iv) completed or caused to be completed
the construction of all facilities or changes contemplated by any of the
Station Licenses or construction Permits issued to modify the Station
Licenses. There are no material Legal Proceedings, applications, petitions,
proceedings, or other material actions, complaints or investigations, pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing before the FCC
relating to any of the Stations, other than those affecting television
broadcast stations generally. None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
nor any Station, has entered into a tolling agreement or otherwise waived any
statute of limitations relating to any of the Stations during which the FCC
may assess any fine or forfeiture or take any other action or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to any FCC action, complaint, investigation or
Legal Proceeding before or brought by the FCC.

 



15 (b) There is not (i) pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
any Legal Proceeding by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend, cancel,
rescind, terminate or materially adversely modify any Station License (other
than, in the case of modifications, proceedings to amend the FCC Rules of
general applicability) or (ii) issued or outstanding, by or before the FCC,
any (A) order to show cause, (B) notice of violation, (C) notice of apparent
liability or (D) order of forfeiture, in each case, against any of the
Stations, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any of the
Stations that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in any
action described in the foregoing clause (i) with respect to such Station
Licenses. The Station Licenses have been issued by the FCC for full terms

the Stations or the Station Licenses.

the Company or any Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole. Neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has

 



18  received written notice of any material claims (described in subsection (i)
or (ii) above) since December 31, 2010, and there are no claims against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary presently pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, alleging material infringement, misappropriation or

respect to office actions in connection with applications in the ordinary
course of prosecution of any applied for Company Registered IP.

(e) Except as expressly provided in the Restructuring Agreements or other
agreements referred to therein, neither the execution, delivery or performance
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transaction or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Restructuring Agreements will, with
or without notice or the lapse of time or both, (i) result in any third party
having or give any third party the right or option to modify or terminate any
material license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other rights with respect
to any Company IP, or (ii) result in any third party having or give any third
party the right or option to receive, or to modify or accelerate the right or
option to receive, any payment with respect to material licensed Company IP.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Information Systems contains
any material "back door," "drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse,"
"virus" or "worm" (as such terms are commonly understood in the
software industry) or any other code designed or intended to (i) disrupt,
disable, harm, impair, distort or otherwise impede in any manner the operation
of, or provide unauthorized access to, any of the Information Systems, or (ii)
damage, destroy or misappropriate any trade secret, information, data or file
on the Information Systems (collectively, " _Malware_ "). The Company and each
Company Subsidiary uses commercially available antivirus software and uses
commercially reasonable efforts to protect its Information Systems from
becoming infected by Malware. To the Knowledge of the Company, there have been
no material breaches of Information Systems that resulted in a disclosure of
any proprietary information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or of

Section 3.18 _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters_.

 

(a) _Section 3.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, as of the date
of this Agreement, each Company Plan and each employment Contract to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party that, in either case,
provides for change in control, termination, severance or similar payments
and, in the case of employment contracts, which termination, severance
or similar payments exceed the lesser of $150,000 or one times base salary.
The Company has provided or made available to Gannett complete and correct
copies of (i) each material Company Plan (or a description of material terms
if there is no written plan document) or employment Contract required to be
listed in _Section 3.17(a)(x)_ or _(xi)_ , including all amendments and
modifications thereto, and (ii) to the extent applicable with respect to

Company Subsidiary has any other express or implied commitment (x) to adopt
any plan or arrangement that would be a material Company Plan if in existence
on the date hereof, or (y) to modify, change or terminate any material Company
Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by ERISA or the Code or that does not increase the costs to the
Company of the benefits provided under such Company Plan.

(b) Each Company Plan intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a), and
the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received (or a request is
pending for) a favorable determination letter, opinion letter or advisory
letter from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code, complete and
correct copies of which have been made available to Gannett. No such
determination letter has been revoked and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, revocation has not been threatened, and no such Company Plan has
been amended since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect (except for any amendments provided or
made available to Gannett pursuant to  _Section 3.18(a)_), and no act or
omission has occurred with respect to the operation of any such Company Plan,
in each case, which, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.18(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company, has in
the past six (6) years maintained, sponsored or been required to contribute to
a Pension Plan, or any multiemployer pension plan within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA. In the six (6) years prior to the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company has incurred any
material liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or
multiemployer Pension Plan that is unsatisfied with respect to a Pension Plan
(other than PBGC premiums) or the IRS under Title IV of ERISA or Code Section
412 and there is no such material liability, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no fact or event exists which would reasonably be expected to give

 



24  rise to any such material liability. There are no material unfunded
obligations under any Company Plan to provide welfare benefits after
Termination of Employment to any employee of the Company (or to any
beneficiary of any such employee), including but not limited to retiree health
coverage and deferred compensation, but excluding continuation of health
coverage required to be continued under Code Section 4980B or other
applicable Law and insurance conversion privileges under state Law.

(d) (i) Each Company Plan has been administered in accordance with its terms,
(ii) the Company, each of its ERISA Affiliates and each Company Plan are in
compliance with the currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and
the regulations thereunder and all other applicable Laws, (iii) none of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, any other "disqualified person" (within the
meaning of Code Section 4975) or any "party in interest" (within the meaning
of Code Section 3(14)) has engaged in any non-exempt prohibited transaction
(within the meaning of Code Section 4975 or Section 406 of ERISA) with respect
to any Company Plans that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) or "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), and (iv) all contributions and premiums required to
have been paid by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to any
Company Plan under the terms of any such plan or its related trust, insurance
contract or other funding arrangement, or pursuant to any applicable Law have
been paid within the time prescribed by any such plan, agreement or applicable
Law, in the case of each of (i) through (iv), except to the extent failure to
do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
result in any liability that is material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(e) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims or Legal Proceedings by or on behalf of any participant or beneficiary
in any Company Plan, or otherwise involving any such Company Plan or the
assets of any Company Plan, other than routine claims for benefits or claims
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(f) There has been no "reportable event" as that term is defined in Section
4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder with respect to any of the
Company Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA which would require the giving of
notice, or any event requiring notice to be provided under Section 4063(a)
of ERISA.

(g) Except as described in _Section 2.3_, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (alone
or together with any other event) or by the Restructuring Agreements would
reasonably be expected to, pursuant to any Company Plan or Contract, (i)
result in any material payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable
to any such individual, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment or vesting of any such material benefits or (iv) give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Section
280G or Code Section 162(m).

 



25 (h) Each Company Plan, employment agreement or other arrangement that is a
nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement subject to Code Section 409A
(each, a " _Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") complies in all
material respects with the requirements thereof and the IRS guidance issued
thereunder, in both form and operation. No Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan or payment to be made pursuant to any Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Tax or
penalty under Code Section 409A. Each Option granted by the Company has been
granted under terms such that the option is exempt from the requirements of
Code Section 409A.

(i) _Section 3.18(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
all collective bargaining agreements and other similar Contracts to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (" _Collective Bargaining
Agreements_ "). A complete and correct copy of each Collective Bargaining
Agreement has been delivered or made available to Gannett. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary has complied fully with each Collective Bargaining
Agreement to which it is a party, except for such noncompliance as had not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

of, and to acquire, own, operate and control, the Retained Stations under the
Communications Laws, including the provisions relating to media ownership and
attribution, foreign ownership and control and character qualifications. To
the Knowledge of Gannett, there are no facts or circumstances that
would, under the Communications Laws or any other applicable Law, disqualify
Gannett as the transferee of control of any of the Retained Station Licenses
or as the owner and operator of the Retained Stations. Assuming consummation
of the Restructuring at the Effective Time, except as set forth in the
Gannett Disclosure Letter (x) no waiver of or exemption, whether temporary or
permanent, from any provision of the Communications Laws, or (y) any
divestiture or other disposition by Gannett or any of its Affiliates of any
asset or property, is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained, in the
case of each of (x) and (y) under the Communications Laws in effect as of the

qualifications of Gannett or any of its Affiliates which might reasonably be
expected to (i) result in the FCCs refusal to grant the FCC Consent or

Consent, or (iii) cause the FCC to impose any material condition on its
granting of the FCC Consent.

 



30 (b) Each Restructuring Assignee is legally, financially and otherwise

the applicable Assigned Stations under the Communications Laws, including the
provisions relating to media ownership and attribution, foreign ownership and
control, and character qualifications. To the Knowledge of Gannett, there are
no facts or circumstances that would, under the Communications Laws or any
other applicable Law, disqualify the Restructuring Assignees as the assignees
of the applicable Assigned Station Licenses or as the owner and operator of
the Assigned Stations. Except as set forth in the Gannett Disclosure Letter
(x) no waiver of or exemption from, whether temporary or permanent, any

of (x) and (y) under the Communications Laws in effect as of the date hereof.
To the Knowledge of Gannett, there are no facts or circumstances related to
the FCC qualifications of the Restructuring Assignees or of any of their
respective Affiliates, which might reasonably be expected to (i) result in
the FCCs refusal to grant the FCC Consent with respect to the Restructuring
or otherwise disqualify any Restructuring Assignee, or (ii) solely with
respect to the FCC Consent relating to the transactions contemplated by the
Restructuring Agreement to which such Restructuring Assignee is a party, (A)

the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as Gannett may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to provide access to any information
that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (a) would result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege with respect to such information ( _provided_ ,
that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege), (b) would result in a breach of any
Contract to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
(except for Contracts that must be disclosed for the Company to comply with
its obligations hereunder), or (c) the disclosure of which, after the
Companys consultation with counsel, would violate any applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company shall provide access to such information to the
maximum extent that disclosure would not result in the events described in
clauses (a) through (c), and, upon Gannetts written request, the
Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver in respect of
information subject to clause (b). All information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.1_ shall be subject to the terms of 

 



35  the letter agreement between Gannett and the Company, dated November 28,
2012 (the " _Nondisclosure Agreement_ "), to the extent such information
constitutes "Company Evaluation Materials" as defined therein; _provided_ ,

investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ shall affect any representations
or warranties made herein, rights of the respective parties hereunder or the
conditions to the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Gannett
shall schedule and coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give
the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof,
setting forth the inspection or materials that Gannett or its Representatives
intend to conduct or review, as applicable.

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement_.

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall, with the
assistance of Gannett, prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, a
proxy statement relating to the approval by the stockholders of the Company of
this Agreement and all other transactions contemplated hereby that, under
applicable Law or NYSE rules, require stockholder approval (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Gannett and the
Company shall cooperate with one another in connection with the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and shall furnish all information concerning such
party as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. Gannett and the Company shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. The Company will file
a definitive Proxy Statement and cause the Proxy Statement to be delivered to
the stockholders of the Company as permitted by the Exchange Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement to include the opinion of the Companys
financial advisor referred to in  _Section 3.23_.

(b) Each of Gannett and the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable notify the other of (i) the receipt of any comments from the SEC
and all other written correspondences and oral communications with the SEC
relating to the Proxy Statement and (ii) any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information
with respect thereto. All filings by the Company with the SEC and deliveries
by the Company to the stockholders of the Company, in each case in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto and the Form 8-K announcing the entry into
this Agreement), shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and comment
of Gannett.

 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Company, Gannett or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Gannett or Merger Sub
which should be set forth in an amendment

 



36  or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, delivered to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

Section 6.3 _Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance with
its Organizational Documents and applicable Law, promptly and duly call and
give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date upon
which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, and shall convene and hold as
promptly as practicable thereafter, a meeting of the stockholders of the
Company (the " _Stockholders  Meeting_") for the sole purpose of seeking the
Stockholder Approval and the approval by the stockholders of the Company of
all other transactions contemplated hereby that, under applicable Law or NYSE
rules, require stockholder approval. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
6.4(d)_, the Company shall recommend approval of this Agreement and include in
the Proxy Statement such recommendation from the Company Board and, unless an
Adverse Recommendation Change occurs, shall take all lawful action to solicit
and obtain the approval of the stockholders of each matter to be voted on at
the Stockholders Meeting. Further, if the Company is unable to obtain a
quorum of its stockholders at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company may
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting if necessary in order to obtain a quorum of
its stockholders.

 

Section 6.4 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate any discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or
cause the destruction of all copies of confidential information previously
provided to such parties by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives. The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or
knowingly permit any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their
respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, except as expressly
provided in this _Section 6.4_, (i) solicit, initiate, induce, encourage or
knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the making
of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, request for information
or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Acquisition Inquiry_ "), (ii) other than with Gannett, Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives, enter into, continue, have or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any non-public information in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal
or any Acquisition Inquiry, (iii) approve, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, or (iv) enter into
any Contract with respect to any of the actions described in clauses (i)
through (iii) of this _Section 6.4(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or
any Related Agreement to the contrary, if at any time after the date hereof
and prior to the receipt

 



37  of the Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any Company Subsidiary
receives a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal (other than as a result of
a breach of this _Section 6.4_) and (ii) the Company Board has in good faith
determined, (A) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn, and (B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company may (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with such Person with
confidentiality provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company
than those contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement then in effect, _provided_
, that a copy of all such information not previously provided to Gannett
(or its Representatives) shall be provided to Gannett prior to or
contemporaneously with providing such Person with such information, and (y)
engage in discussions and negotiations with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives.

(c) The Company shall provide Gannett orally and in writing as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and no later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt and at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to furnishing information
permitted under _Section 6.4(b)_ to any Person making an Acquisition
Proposal) of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes
thereto) or Acquisition Inquiry and the identity of the Person making any such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and, if in writing, shall provide
Gannett with a copy of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The
Company shall keep Gannett reasonably informed of the status (including any
changes to the material terms and conditions thereof) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. The Company agrees that neither it nor any
Company Subsidiary will enter any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Gannett.

(d) The Company Board shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Gannett) or publicly propose to
withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Gannett), the approval,
adoption, recommendation or declaration of advisability of this Agreement or
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or
approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") (it being
understood that any such disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the recommendation of the Merger by the Company Board in such disclosure) or
(ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.4(b)_) (A) constituting
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or
(B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail

 



38  to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that, in the case of this clause (ii), the Company
shall not be prohibited from entering into any such Contract or document if,
subject to compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 6.4_, it
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ and
pays Gannett the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, but subject to the Companys compliance with the other
provisions of this _Section 6.4_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change related to an Acquisition Proposal or take an action described in
clause (ii) of this _Section 6.4 _if (A) the Company Board has in good faith
determined that, (x) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is and continues to be a
Superior Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn, and
(y) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law, (B) the Company Board shall have
first provided prior written notice to Gannett that it is prepared to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change or accept a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), which Superior Proposal Notice shall contain a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal (it being understood
and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) and, if in writing, include a
copy of such Proposal, and (C) Gannett does not make, within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice, a written
proposal setting forth revised terms and conditions of this Agreement that
would, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, cause the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal no longer to constitute a Superior
Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Counternotice_ "). If Gannett has in good
faith delivered a Superior Proposal Counternotice to the Company during the
five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice,
then the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Gannett for the three (3)
Business Day period following the Companys receipt of the Superior Proposal
Counternotice regarding any such revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement set forth in such Superior Proposal Counternotice. Any
material changes to the financial terms or any material change to other
material terms of such Superior Proposal occurring prior to the making of an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.4(d)_ by the
Company Board or the Company terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_ shall require the Company to deliver to Gannett a new Superior
Proposal Notice, give Gannett a new five (5) Business Day period following
receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice for Gannett to deliver a Superior
Proposal Counternotice, and give the parties a new three (3) Business Day
negotiating window if Gannett delivers the Company a Superior Proposal
Counternotice during such period.

 

(e) The Company agrees not to release any Person from, or to amend or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality, standstill or similar Contract to
which the Company is or becomes a party in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, unless the Company Board has in good faith
determined, (i) after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors, that the offer or proposal to which such Contract relates
is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law.

 



39 (f) The Company shall ensure that its Representatives and the Representatives
of the Company Subsidiaries are aware of the provisions of this _Section
6.4_, and the Company acknowledges and agrees that any action taken by or at
the direction of any Company director or officer that, if taken by the
Company, would constitute a breach of this _Section 6.4_, will be deemed to
constitute a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by the Company.

 

Section 6.5 _Further Action; Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, the Company, Gannett
and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates
to, use reasonable best efforts to:

 

(i) obtain as promptly as practicable any necessary permits, consents,
approvals, waivers and authorizations of, actions or nonactions by, and make
as promptly as practicable all necessary filings and submissions with, any
Governmental Authority or any third party necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, as
applicable, the Restructuring Agreements;

(ii) (A) avoid a Legal Proceeding, petition to deny, objection or
investigation, whether judicial or administrative and whether brought by a
Governmental Authority or other Person, and (B) avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, stay, temporary restraining order
or other order in any such Legal Proceeding, petition to deny, objection or
investigation, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), challenging this Agreement
or any Restructuring Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or that would or would be reasonably likely to otherwise prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Restructuring Agreements;

 

(iii) cooperate at Gannetts cost (A) to facilitate mailing of a notice of
redemption under the Supplemental Indenture within three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time for the redemption of all of the Companys
outstanding 8% Senior Notes due November 15, 2016, including, but not limited
to, providing such notices, officers certificates, resolutions of the
Company Board, opinions of counsel and other documents, and taking such other
actions, as may be reasonably requested by Gannett in connection with such
redemption, (B) to facilitate termination of the Companys revolving credit
facility, including by providing the administrative agent thereunder with
notice of termination no later than five (5) Business Days before the Closing,
to be effective no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective
Time, and (C) to facilitate the assumption by Gannett of, or the substitution
of Gannett for the Company under, the Companys outstanding 7 3/4% Senior
Debentures due June 1, 2027 and 7 1/4% Senior Debentures due September 15,
2027 (collectively, the " _Debentures_ ") pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, effective as of or after the Effective Time, as reasonably
requested by Gannett, including (x) providing such notices, officers
certificates, resolutions of the Company Board, opinions of counsel and other
documents and taking such other actions, using its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Gannett to be substituted for Belo as successor corporation
under Section 9.1 of the Indenture, and (y) using its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit the consent of the holders of each series of Debentures to
the substitution of Gannett as the successor corporation to the Company
pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Indenture, in each case 

 



40  as may be reasonably requested by Gannett in connection with such assumption
or substitution, as applicable;

(iv) upon the request of Gannett and at its expense, the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist Gannett and Gannetts independent public
accountants in the compilation and preparation of all financial statements
and financial statement schedules of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(prepared in accordance with GAAP) and reports and consents of the Companys
independent accountants as may be necessary for Gannett to comply with SEC or
other reporting and disclosure requirements. If requested by Gannett, the
Company shall deliver to Gannett or its or the Companys independent public
accountants all engagement letters and management representation letters as
may be reasonably requested by Gannett or such accountants, which shall cover
such periods as Gannett may reasonably request. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
independent public accountants to cooperate with and assist Gannett and its
independent public accountants in the preparation of the financial statements
contemplated by this _Section 6.5 (a)(iv)_, including such cold comfort
letters from the Companys independent public accountants as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any reports, registration statements,
consent or information statements, offering circulars, placement memoranda or
other disclosure documents;

 

(v) cooperate with each other in (A) determining which filings are required to
be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which material consents,
approvals, Permits, notices or authorizations are required to be obtained
prior to the Effective Time from, Governmental Authorities or third parties in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
related agreements, including the Restructuring Agreements, and consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) timely making all
such filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, Permits, notices
or authorizations; 

(vi) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable; and

(vii) take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be
done, and cooperate with each other in order to do, all other things
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Restructuring Agreements as soon as practicable.

In connection with the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company, on the one hand, will provide Gannett, and Gannett, on the
other hand, will provide the Company, with copies of any material
correspondence, filing or communication (or oral summaries or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between such party or any of its
Representatives and any third party with respect to the obligations set forth
in this  _Section 6.5_. Prior to submitting or making any such
correspondence, filing or communication to any Governmental Authority or
members of their respective staffs, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the parties shall first provide the other party with a copy of such
correspondence, filing or communication in draft form and give such other
party a reasonable opportunity to discuss its content before it is submitted
or filed with the relevant Governmental Authorities, and shall consider and
take account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party with
respect thereto. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the
parties

 



41  shall ensure that the other party is given the opportunity to attend any
meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) For purposes of this _Section 6.5_, "reasonable best efforts" shall
include (i) diligently prosecuting the FCC Applications, (ii) vigorously
defending, contesting and objecting to any claims, Legal Proceedings,
petitions to deny, objections or other proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, by or before any Governmental Authority or arbitral body
challenging the Transaction, including this Agreement, the Restructuring
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or that would
otherwise prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Restructuring Agreements, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or
other Governmental Authority or arbitral body vacated or reversed, and (iii)
executing settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other
Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, other than with respect to Auxiliary
Measures, Gannett shall not be required to (A) waive any substantial rights or
accept any substantial limitation on its operations, in each case, in respect
of any Material Assets, or to dispose of any Material Assets; or (B) dispose
of any assets, or otherwise take or agree to take any action or agree or
consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any such businesses,
assets, licenses, services or operations of Gannett, Merger Sub, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Affiliates) that,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect or Gannett Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

(c) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section
6.5(b)_ above:

(i) Within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the Company,
Gannett and Merger Sub, as applicable, shall file, and the Company shall cause
the applicable Company Subsidiaries to file, applications with the FCC
requesting the grant of its consent (A) with respect to the transfer of
control of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to Gannett as contemplated
by the Merger (the " _Merger Applications_"), and (B) with respect to the
assignment of the Assigned Stations and the Assigned Station Licenses to the
Restructuring Assignees, as contemplated by the Restructuring Agreements (the
" _Restructuring Applications_" and, together with the Merger Applications,
individually and collectively, the " _FCC Applications_"). The Company,
Gannett and Merger Sub shall, and the Company shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain the FCC Consent as
promptly as practicable. Gannett and the Company shall bear the cost of FCC
filing fees relating to the Merger Applications equally. Except as otherwise
contemplated by the proviso of _Section 6.5(b)_, no party hereto shall take
(or permit its controlled Affiliates to take) any action that would, or omit
to take (or permit its controlled Affiliates to omit to take) any action the
failure of which to take would have, or would reasonably be expected to have,
the effect of materially delaying the grant of the FCC Consent. The Company
and Gannett, as applicable, shall, and the Company shall cause the applicable
Company Subsidiaries to, each oppose any petitions to deny or other objections
filed with respect to the FCC Applications to the extent such petition or
objection relates to such Person in respect of the Transaction. As may
reasonably be necessary or advisable to facilitate the grant of the FCC
Consent with respect to the

 



42  Restructuring Applications, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause
each applicable Company Subsidiary to, promptly enter into customary
assignment or other arrangements, as may be requested by the FCC to resolve
any complaints with the FCC relating to any FCC License with respect to any
Station.

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, the
Company, Gannett and Merger Sub shall make any required filings with the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")pursuant to the HSR Act, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including a request for early termination of
the waiting period thereunder, and shall thereafter promptly respond to all
requests received from such agencies for additional information or
documentation. Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne equally by Gannett and the
Company.

 

(d) In connection with the expiration of the Station Licenses as set forth in
_Section 3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, if, at any point prior to
the Effective Date, an application for the renewal of any Station License (a "
_Renewal Application_ ") must be filed pursuant to the Communications Laws,
the Company shall, and the Company shall cause the applicable Company
Subsidiaries to, timely execute, file and prosecute with the FCC such Renewal
Application in accordance with this _Section 6.5(d)_. In order to avoid
disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Applications, Gannett shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, agree (i) as part of the FCC Applications,
to request that the FCC apply its policy of permitting the transfer of control
or assignment of FCC Licenses in transactions involving multiple stations
to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of any application for the renewal
of any FCC License, and (ii) to make such representations and undertakings as
are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including undertakings to
assume, as between the parties and the FCC, the position of the applicant
before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume
the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.
In addition, Gannett and Merger Sub acknowledge that, to the extent
reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any Renewal
Application with respect to any Station and thereby to facilitate the grant of
the FCC Consent with respect to such Station, the Company (or any applicable
Company Subsidiary) shall enter into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend
the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture
penalty against such Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints
that such Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or
profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such Station
with respect to which the FCC may permit the Company (or any applicable
Company Subsidiary) to enter into a tolling agreement. The Company and
Gannett shall consult in good faith with each other prior to the Company (or
any applicable Company Subsidiary) entering into any such tolling agreement
under this _Section 6.5(d)_.

 

(e) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement under _Section 8.1_, Gannett and the Company shall jointly
request an extension of the effective period of the FCC Consent. No extension
of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either party to exercise its
rights under _Section 8.1_.

 



43 Section 6.6 _Public Announcements; Public Disclosures_. Each press release
or other public statement by the Company or Gannett with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall, prior to the issuance
or release thereof, be approved in writing by Gannett and the Company (which
approval shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any press release or public statement as
may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of the NYSE may be made by the Company or Gannett,
after consultation with counsel and no earlier than the final date that such
press release or public statement may be made pursuant to such Law, listing
agreement or rule of the NYSE, so long as the Company or Gannett,
respectively, uses its commercially reasonable efforts to allow Gannett or the
Company reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance and accepts any reasonable changes or comments reasonably
made by Gannett or the Company, and (ii) the Company shall be permitted to
make such statements and announcements to its employees in furtherance of the
Merger that would not be required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC as
the Company shall deem to be reasonably necessary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall limit the Companys or the
Company Boards rights under _Section 6.4_, (B) no such press release
or public statement shall be subject to Gannetts prior written approval if
the Company Board has effected any Adverse Recommendation Change in compliance
with _Section 6.4_, and (C) no "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act made in compliance with _Section 6.4(d)_ shall require
Gannetts prior written approval.

 

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and, except as otherwise provided in
clause (iv) below, for a period of one year thereafter, Gannett shall provide,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the
Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(other than such employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or
employees participating in the Belo Change in Control Severance Plan (" _CIC
Plan Participant_ ")) (each, an " _Affected Employee_ "), (i) a base salary or
regular hourly wage, whichever is applicable, that is no less favorable than
the base salary or regular hourly wage provided to such Affected Employee by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that Gannett
shall have the right to reduce the base salary or regular hourly wages of an
Affected Employee consistent with such reductions that are made to similarly
situated employees of the Broadcasting Segment of Gannett, (ii) commission
opportunities that are no less favorable than the commission
opportunities provided to such Affected Employee by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time; provided that commissions will only be paid to
extent of satisfaction of the specified performance goals, (iii) benefits
under qualified defined contribution retirement plans that are no less
favorable than those provided to such Affected Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) welfare benefits that (A)
for the remaining portion of the 2013 calendar year, are no less favorable
than the welfare benefits provided to such Affected Employee by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) for the 2014 calendar year
are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the welfare benefits provided
to such Affected Employee by the Company in the 2013 calendar year, modified
as necessary so that the increase to the aggregate budgeted welfare benefits
costs

 



44  to the Company of all such plans for the 2014 calendar year does not exceed
5% of the aggregate budgeted welfare benefits costs to the Company of all such
plans for the 2013 calendar year (assuming no significant change in the
number of participants in such plans from 2013 to 2014); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to "paid time off" benefits, Gannett will
maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, the Companys paid
time off policy and honor all accruals thereunder through December 31, 2014
and there will be no carryover of paid time off benefits after 2014.
Additionally, effective as of the Effective Time, with respect to Affected
Employees who are eligible to participate in the Companys incentive plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the following will apply with respect
to their incentive opportunities: (x) for the remaining portion of the
2013 fiscal year of the Surviving Corporation, Gannett will maintain, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, the Companys annual cash bonus
programs as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall
administer (or cause to be administered) such plans in a manner consistent
with the Companys practices prior to the Effective Time and the provisions
set forth in _Section 6.7(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (y)
for the 2014 fiscal year of the Surviving Corporation, (I) Gannett will
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, such Affected
Employees with an annual cash bonus program on a basis and with terms and
conditions that are no less favorable than the program that is offered to
similarly situated employees of the Broadcasting Segment of Gannett and (II)
such Affected Employees will be eligible for participation in the Gannett
equity incentive compensation program on a basis and with terms and
conditions that are no less favorable than those offered to similarly
situated employees of the Broadcasting Segment of Gannett. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, for the one year period following the
Effective Time, Gannett shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide each Affected Employee who incurs a termination of employment that
would entitle such employee to severance benefits under the circumstances set
forth in _Section 6.7(a)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_Severance Plan_ ") with severance benefits in amounts and on terms and
conditions consistent with the Severance Plan, with any such severance to be
determined based on the Affected Employees base salary or regular hourly
wage as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (or any higher
amount as in effect thereafter) and taking into account the Affected
Employees continuous service with the Company (including any current or
former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company) prior to
the Effective Time and with Gannett (or any of its affiliates including the
Company and its affiliates) after the Effective Time. Each employee of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries who as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be
provided with compensation and benefits consistent with the terms of the
applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect. 

(b) Following the Effective Time, with respect to the Affected Employees,
Gannett shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
that periods of employment with the Company (including any current or former
affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company) shall be taken
into account for purposes of determining, as applicable, the
eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits under all employee benefit plans
maintained by Gannett or an affiliate of Gannett for the benefit of the
Affected Employees (the " _New Plans_ ") provided that such service credit (i)
shall not apply for purposes of calculating a participants benefit under a
defined benefit pension plan, (ii) shall not result in a duplication of
benefits for the same period of service; (iii) shall not apply to newly
established plans for which similar situated employees of the Broadcasting
Segment of Gannett do not receive such credit;

 



45  and (iv) shall only apply to the extent that the Affected Employee received
such service credit under a similar Old Plan (as defined below) immediately
prior to commencing participation in the New Plan. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such service credit rules shall not apply to any New Plan that is
frozen to new participation or that provides grandfathered benefits (e.g.,
Affected Employees may not participate in Gannetts pension plans or retiree
welfare plans that are closed to new participants or provide grandfathered
benefits). The protections set forth in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall apply to
the CIC Plan Participants but only with respect to New Plans that are
generally offered to all Affected Employees.

(c) Following the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of 
_Section 6.7(b)_, (i) each Affected Employee or CIC Plan Participant shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time or satisfaction
of evidence of insurability requirements, in any and all New Plans that
are health (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes medical, dental,
vision and prescription drug insurance) or income replacement plans to the
extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Plan that is a
health or income replacement plan in which such Affected Employee or CIC Plan
Participant participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), other than waiting periods or evidence of
insurability requirements that would have been in effect with respect to such
Affected Employee or CIC Plan Participant immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the comparable Old Plan; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing health or income replacement benefits to any Affected Employee or
CIC Plan Participant, Gannett shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable Old Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Affected Employee or CIC Plan
Participant with all deductible payments, out-of-pocket or other co-payments
paid by such employee under any Old Plan providing health benefits during the
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
for the purpose of determining the extent to which any such employee has
satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has reached the out-of-
pocket maximum under any New Plan providing health benefits.

(d) Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any employee of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates any benefits under any
benefit plans, programs, policies or other arrangements, including severance
benefits or right to employment or continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and are
not for the benefit of any third party.

Section 6.8 _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) Gannett and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify (including advancement of expenses to the extent provided in the
Companys Organizational Documents) and hold harmless all Indemnified Persons
to the same extent such persons are indemnified by the Company or held
harmless as of the date of this Agreement 

 



46  pursuant to the Companys Organizational Documents and indemnification
agreements identified on _Section 6.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law for acts or omissions
which occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to
any matter relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as those
provisions contained in the Companys Organizational Documents in effect on
the date hereof, and for a period of six (6) years from the date hereof such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
adverse to any present or former director and officer of the Company (each,
an " _Indemnified Person_ ") unless such modification is required by
applicable Law.

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability coverage maintained by
the Company, true and correct copies of which have been furnished to Gannett,
_provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
replacement policies and/or purchase (or, prior to the Closing, Gannett may
purchase in lieu hereof but subject to the limitations herein) a run-off or
tail insurance policy, in each case with reputable and financially sound
carriers, with at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are substantially the same as, or more favorable than, those
of the Companys current policies, including deductibles and caps that are no
less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than those in effect as of the date
hereof, covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including with respect to any matter relating to or arising
out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, with respect
to officers and directors who are currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy; _provided_ _further_
that if the annual premiums for such insurance for any single year in such
six-year period shall exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the per annum
rate of premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof for such insurance, then Gannett shall, or cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide only such coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium
equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of such rate.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, all Indemnified Persons and such persons heirs and
representatives. The rights of all Indemnified Persons under this _Section
6.8_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Indemnified Person may have by
contract, applicable Law or otherwise. The obligations under this _Section
6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Person without his or her written consent.

(d) If Gannett, the Surviving Corporation or any of its or their successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Gannett or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.8_. 

 



47 Section 6.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable
to the Merger, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and (b) otherwise take all such actions as are
reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Takeover
Law on the Merger.

Section 6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of the Company, on the one hand,
and Gannett, on the other hand, will (a) promptly advise the other in writing
of any Legal Proceeding threatened, commenced or asserted against it or any
of its stockholders, directors, officers or Affiliates relating to this
Agreement, the Merger, the Restructuring or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Restructuring Agreements, and (b) give the
other party the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or
settlement of any such Legal Proceeding. Except as permitted by _Section
5.1(b)(xii)_, no compromise or full or partial settlement of any such Legal
Proceeding will be agreed without the other partys prior written consent,
which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition of any equity securities of the Company (including
Derivative Securities) pursuant to this Agreement by any officer or director
of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section
16 of the Exchange Act (" _Section 16_ ") shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16\.

Section 6.12 _Resignations_. If requested by Gannett prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
directors and officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as specified
by Gannett, to tender their resignations as directors or officers, as
applicable, effective as of the Effective Time and to deliver to Gannett
written evidence of such resignations at the Effective Time. 

Section 6.13 _Transfer Taxes_. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (other than
such Taxes required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the holder of record of the Common Shares
with respect to which such payment is made), shall be borne and paid by the
Surviving Corporation (regardless of the Person liable for such Taxes
under applicable Law).

part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such
prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that, after the
Closing, Gannett may assign some or all of its rights, interests and/or
obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates of Gannett or to
any purchaser or purchasers of the stock, assets or business of Surviving
Corporation (whether structured as a sale of assets, merger, or otherwise).
Any such assignment shall not relieve Gannett of its obligations hereunder.

 

Section 10.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to provisions of conflicts of laws.

Section 10.7 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware in any Legal Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) waives
any claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court, and
(d) agrees not to bring any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement in any other court. Each party agrees to accept service of any
summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided for
the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_; _provided_ , that nothing in this
_Section 10.7_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve such summons,
complaint or other initial pleading in any other manner permitted by Law. EACH
OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT.

Section 10.8 _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein (including
_Section 8.2_, _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.3_), whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

Section 10.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties.

 

Section 10.10 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

 



67 Section 10.11 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Gannett, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company, in the
case of Gannett, or of Gannett or Merger Sub, in the case of the Company, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties, in the case of
Gannett, of the Company and, in the case of the Company, of Gannett or Merger
Sub, in each case, contained herein (or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto), and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions,
in the case of Gannett, of the Company and, in the case of the Company, of
Gannett or Merger Sub, in each case, contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. In
addition to the first sentence of this _Section 10.11_ and notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if as of the Outside Date
all conditions to this Agreement have been satisfied or waived other than any
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1(a) _and _(b)_ and
_Section 7.3(c)_, either Gannett or the Company (if the failure to be
satisfied or waived by such date has not in material part resulted from a
breach of this Agreement by such party) may unilaterally extend, by written
notice to the other, the Outside Date to 5:00 p.m., local New York time, on
June 27, 2014. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall act as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder.

Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or
more counterparts (delivery of which may be by facsimile or .pdf), each of
which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute one
and the same instrument.

 

Section 10.13 _Severability_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for
any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall be ineffective in the jurisdiction involved to the
extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions or any other provisions hereof,
unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

Section 10.14 _Third Parties_. Except as otherwise set forth in _Section
6.8_, nothing contained in this Agreement or in any instrument or document
executed by any party in connection with the Merger shall create any rights
in, or be deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person or
entity that is not a party hereto or a permitted successor or assign of such
a party.

Section 10.15 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or
the Merger was not consummated, and that money damages would not be
an adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other
appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties obligations to consummate the
Merger) in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are 

 



68  entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or
that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.
