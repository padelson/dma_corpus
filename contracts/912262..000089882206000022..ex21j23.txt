                                   ARTICLE II
                                   THE MERGER


          Section 2.1    THE MERGER.

          (a)   At the Effective Time, in accordance with the Delaware
Corporate Law, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, at which
time the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
survive the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

          (b)  As soon as reasonably practicable after the satisfaction or
valid waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Sub will
file a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") meeting the
requirements of the Delaware Corporate Law with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is endorsed by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later time as the Company and Merger Sub may agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective,
the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

          (c)    The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable
provisions of the Delaware Corporate Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

          (d)  The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place (i) at
the offices of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP located in Los Angeles, California,
as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event, no later than the second
Business Day) after the day on which the last condition to the Merger set forth
in ARTICLE IX is satisfied or validly waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or valid waiver of such conditions) or (ii) at such other place and
time or on such other date as the Company and Merger Sub may agree in writing
(the actual date of the Closing, the "CLOSING DATE").

          Section 2.2    CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective Time,
pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of the Common Stock:

          (a)  Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or otherwise owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including shares of Common Stock acquired by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Contribution and
Exchange Agreements), if any, shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no payment or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect
thereto.



                                       9



<PAGE>


          (b)  Each Merger Sub Common Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

          (c)  Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to SECTION
2.2(A) and Dissenting Common Shares (as hereinafter defined)), automatically
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive $37.25 in cash,
without interest (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"), payable to the holder thereof
upon surrender of the stock certificate formerly representing such Common Share
in the manner provided in SECTION 2.3. Such Common Shares, other than those
canceled pursuant to SECTION 2.2(A), sometimes are referred to herein as the
"MERGER SHARES."

          (d)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
if required by the Delaware Corporate Law but only to the extent required
thereby, Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to SECTION
2.2(A)) and that are held by holders of such Common Shares who have not voted in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of the Delaware Corporate Law (the
"DISSENTING COMMON SHARES") will not be convertible into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Common Shares will be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Common
Shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the Delaware Corporate Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such Dissenting Common Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. At the
Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Common Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of the
Delaware Corporate Law and as provided in the previous sentence. The Company
will give Parent (i) notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of shares of Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle any such
demands.

          (e)  If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
number of outstanding Common Shares is changed into a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the amount of Merger Consideration
payable per Common Share shall be correspondingly adjusted.

          (f)  All vested or unvested restricted shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all vested and unvested
restricted share units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "COMPANY RESTRICTED SHARES") shall, by virtue of this
Agreement and, without further action of the Company, Parent,



                                       10



<PAGE>


Merger Sub or the holder of such Company Restricted Shares, vest and
become free of all restrictions immediately prior to the Effective Time and
shall be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist and shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

          (g) The Company Options shall be treated as provided in SECTION 2.4.

          (h) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the contribution of Common Shares by the Contributing Holders to Parent pursuant
to the Contribution and Exchange Agreements shall be deemed to occur immediately
prior to the Effective Time and prior to any other above-described event.

          Section 2.3   PAYMENT OF CASH FOR MERGER SHARES.

          (a)    Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that is organized
and doing business under the laws of the United States or any state thereof and
that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 to serve as the
disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the
Company Options, unless another agent is designated as provided in SECTION
2.4(A) (the "DISBURSING AGENT"). At or prior to the Closing, Parent will cause
to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent cash in the aggregate amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to
pay for Company Options pursuant to SECTION 2.4. Pending distribution of the
cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent, such cash shall be held in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and such Company Options and shall
not be used for any other purposes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent may direct
the Disbursing Agent to invest such cash in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, as long as no such investments have maturities that
could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to SECTION 2.3(B).

          (b)    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but no
later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall send, or cause the Disbursing Agent to send, to each record
holder of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to SECTION 2.2(A)) a letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary
form and will specify that delivery of Merger Shares will be effected, and risk
of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the stock certificates
representing the Merger Shares to the Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such
stock certificate or certificates to the Disbursing Agent together with a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
documentation that the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in exchange therefor, less any amounts required to be withheld for Tax. Until so
surrendered and exchanged, each such certificate shall, after the Effective
Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to the holder of
such outstanding certificate in respect thereof.



                                       11



<PAGE>


          (c)   If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Merger Shares represented by the certificate or certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that
the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Disbursing
Agent that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not payable.

          (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Common Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates representing Merger Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this ARTICLE II.

          (e)   If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains
unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered
his Merger Shares certificates for the Merger Consideration prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for an amount paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date immediately prior
to such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

          (f)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate for Common Shares.

          (g)   From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Common Shares
(other than Dissenting Common Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Shares, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Agreement.

          (h)   In the event that any Merger Share certificate has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Merger Share certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in
addition to the posting by such holder of any bond in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Merger Share
certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Merger Share certificate the proper amount of the Merger
Consideration.

          (i)   Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder any amounts



                                       12



<PAGE>


required to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent
any amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the holder from whose Merger Consideration the
amounts were so deducted and withheld.

          Section 2.4   TREATMENT OF OPTIONS.

          (a)   As of the Effective Time, each Company Option (other than
Amended Options) will be cancelled and extinguished, and the holder thereof will
be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (A) the
product of (i) the number of Common Shares subject to such Company Option and
(ii) the Merger Consideration over (B) the aggregate exercise price of such
Company Option, without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under any applicable Law. All payments with respect to canceled
Company Options shall be made by the Disbursing Agent (or such other agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the
Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
from funds deposited by or at the direction of Parent to pay such amounts in
accordance with SECTION 2.3(A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
Company Options that are identified in a Contribution and Exchange Agreement
between a Contributing Holder and Parent, such Company Options will be assumed
by Parent and amended concurrently with the consummation of the Merger pursuant
to the terms of such Contribution and Exchange Agreement (any Company Option so
to be amended, an "AMENDED OPTION").

          (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent will adopt
such resolutions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the actions
contemplated by this SECTION 2.4, without paying any consideration or incurring
any debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

          (c)   Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts to be paid hereunder in respect of Company Options
or Company Restricted Shares any amounts required to be deducted and withheld
under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
Company Option or Company Restricted Share holder from whose payments in respect
of Company Options or Company Restricted Shares the amounts were so deducted and
withheld.

                            THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

          Section 3.1   ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be amended as set forth on EXHIBIT B, and, as so amended, shall be

amended in accordance with the terms thereof and as provided by applicable Law.

          Section 3.2   BYLAWS. The bylaws of the Company in effect at the
Effective Time shall be amended to read the same as the bylaws of the Merger Sub
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms
thereof and as provided by applicable Law.

          Section 3.3   DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. From and after the Effective
Time, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company at
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified in accordance with applicable Law.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

          Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of
the Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent and Merger Sub by the Company
concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the "DISCLOSURE LETTER") or as
may be disclosed in reasonable detail in any Current Company SEC Report filed
prior to the date hereof (it being understood that any information set forth in
a particular section or subsection of the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
be disclosed in each other section or subsection thereof to which the relevance
of such information is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

          Section 4.1   CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER.

          (a)   Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
corporate powers and authority required to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company has all
corporate powers and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, and to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform each of its obligations hereunder. Each of the Company Joint Ventures
has all powers and authority required to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

          (b)   Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries listed on Exhibit 21.1
to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January
29, 2005 (the "SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES") is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
or be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the
Company Subsidiaries (other than the Significant Subsidiaries) has any material
assets or liabilities, conducts any operations or has any employees.

          (c)   The Company has made available to Parent and Merger Sub true and
complete copies of the currently effective articles of incorporation and bylaws
or similar organizational and governing documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary nor, to the Company's knowledge, any Company Joint Venture, is in
violation of its organizational or governing documents.

rights to indemnity hereunder may be limited by federal or state securities laws
or the public policies embodied therein, (ii) as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (iii) as the
remedy of specific performance and other forms of injunctive relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which
any proceeding therefor may be brought.

          (c)       On or prior to the date hereof, the Board of Directors of
the Company, based on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, has

          (d)       Merrill Lynch & Co. (the "COMPANY FINANCIAL ADVISOR") has
delivered to the Board of the Directors of the Company its opinion to the effect
that, as of the date such opinion was delivered, the consideration to be

<PAGE>


or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to be material to the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary and (B) would not reasonably be expected to adversely
effect in any material respect, or materially hinder or delay, the consummation
of the Merger or the Company's ability to observe and perform its obligations
hereunder.

          Section 4.4   NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the organizational or governing documents of the Company or any of
its Significant Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures; (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referenced in SECTION 4.3 and the receipt of the Requisite
Shareholder Vote, contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any

agreement, contract or other instrument applicable to or binding upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures, except those
consents set forth in Section 4.4 of the Disclosure Letter (the "REQUIRED
CONTRACTUAL CONSENTS"); or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
on any assets that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole (other than any such Lien as may be created or imposed in connection with
the Financing or as otherwise may arise from any actions taken by Parent or
Merger Sub), except in the case of (ii) - (iv) above, which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or materially hinder or delay the consummation of
the Merger or the Company's ability to observe and perform its obligations
hereunder.

          Section 4.5   CAPITALIZATION.

          (a)   The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
75,000,000 Common Shares, of which as of January 18, 2006 there were 26,436,542

Options and other stock-related awards, including grants of Company Restricted
Shares, which list sets forth the name of the holders thereof and, to the extent
applicable thereto, the exercise price or purchase price thereof, the governing
stock option plan with respect thereto and the expiration date thereof.

          (b)   Except as set forth in SECTION 4.5(A), and except for changes
since January 18, 2006 resulting from the exercise of Company Options
outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding, and there have not been
reserved for issuance, any (i) shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company; (ii) securities of the Company or any Subsidiary
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company



                                       16



<PAGE>


or its Subsidiaries; (iii) Company Options or other rights or options to acquire
from the Company or its Subsidiaries, or obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be; or
(iv) equity equivalent interests in the ownership or earnings of the Company of
its Subsidiaries or other similar rights (the items in CLAUSES (I) through (IV)
collectively, "COMPANY SECURITIES"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities. There are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or by which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or preemptive
rights with respect thereto.

          (c)   Other than the issuance of Common Shares upon exercise of
Company Options, since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not declared or
paid any dividend or distribution in respect of any Company Securities, and
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed
or otherwise acquired any Company Securities, and their respective Boards of
Directors have not authorized any of the foregoing.

          (d)   Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
any commitment or agreement, or are otherwise obligated, to contribute capital,
loan money or otherwise provide funds or make additional investments in any
Company Joint Venture or any other Person.

          Section 4.6        COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES.

          (a)   Section 4.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth all
Subsidiaries of the Company and Company Joint Ventures, as well as the
respective jurisdictions of incorporation and all jurisdictions in which the
Company and such Subsidiaries and Company Joint Ventures are qualified to do
business. Each of the Company Subsidiaries is wholly owned (directly or
indirectly) by the Company and, except for such Company Subsidiaries and Company
Joint Ventures, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity
interest in any other Person.

          (b)   All equity interests of the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Joint Ventures held by the Company or any other Company Subsidiary are fully
paid and non-assessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. All such equity interests are free and clear of any Liens or any
other limitations or restrictions on such equity interests (including any
limitation or restriction on the right to vote, pledge or sell or otherwise
dispose of such equity interests).

          Section 4.7 REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

          (a)   The Company has timely filed with or otherwise furnished to the
SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since
August 4, 2003 (such documents, as supplemented or amended since the time of
filing, the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS"). No Subsidiary of the Company is or at any
time since August 4, 2003 has been required to file with



                                       17



<PAGE>


or furnish to the SEC any such forms, reports, schedules or other documents. As
of their respective dates, the Company SEC Reports, including any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, at the
time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on
the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively) (i) complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and (ii) did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (b)   The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements included or incorporated by reference
in the Company SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the periods set forth
therein, and in each case were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved (except as otherwise disclosed in the notes
thereto and subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end adjustments that
would not be material in amount or effect).

          (c)   There are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise) which, individually or in the aggregate, would be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole other than (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in the Balance Sheet or
disclosed in the notes thereto; (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred after
the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business; (iii) liabilities
under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iv) liabilities disclosed on Section 4.15 of the
Disclosure Letter.

          (d)   The Company has heretofore made available or promptly will make
available to Parent and Merger Sub a complete and correct copy of any amendments
or modifications to any Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof which
are required to be filed with the SEC but have not yet been filed with the SEC,
and any Company SEC Reports required to be filed by the Company on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

         Section 4.8    DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS. The proxy statement (the "COMPANY
PROXY STATEMENT") and the Rule 13e-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3
(the "SCHEDULE 13E-3") relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, to be filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with
seeking the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Company shareholders
will not, at the date it is first mailed to shareholders of the Company (in the
case of the Proxy Statement) or at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting
(other than as to information supplied by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion
therein), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Company will cause the Company Proxy Statement, the Schedule
13E-3 and all related SEC filings to comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act applicable thereto as of the date of
such filing. No representation is made by the Company with respect to statements
made in the



                                       18



<PAGE>


Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 based on information supplied, or
required to be supplied, by Parent and Merger Sub or their Affiliates
specifically for inclusion therein.

          Section 4.9   ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS.

          (a)   Since the Balance Sheet Date through the date hereof, the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Company's knowledge,
the businesses of the Company Joint Ventures, have been conducted in all
material respects in the ordinary course and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to the Company's knowledge any Company Joint Venture, has
engaged in any transaction or series of related transactions outside the
ordinary course material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE
COMPANY" means any change, circumstance, event or effect that would be
materially adverse to the assets and liabilities, business, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
other than any change, circumstance, event or effect resulting from (i) changes
in general economic conditions, (ii) the announcement or pendency of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) general changes or
developments in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
operate, (iv) any actions required under this Agreement to obtain any approval
or authorization under the HSR Act or any applicable Other Antitrust Laws for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (v)
changes in any Laws or applicable accounting regulations or principles, except,
in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (iii), to the extent such changes
or developments referred to therein would reasonably be expected to have a
materially disproportionate impact on the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to other industry participants, it being understood that in the event
the Company should fail to meet any expected financial or operating performance
targets, the fact of such failure, alone, would not constitute a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company (although any party can assert the facts
underlying any such failure in any dispute as to whether there has been a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company).

          (b)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing SECTION 4.9(A),
since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been (except, in each case, for
transactions solely among the Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among
the Company's wholly-owned Subsidiaries):

          (i)   any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
     distribution or capital return in respect of any shares of the Company's
     capital stock or any redemption, purchase or other acquisition by the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any shares of the Company's capital
     stock or any amendment of any material term of any outstanding capital
     stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (ii)  any (A) incurrence of, or guarantee with respect to, or
     provision of credit support for, any indebtedness for borrowed money by the
     Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than pursuant to the Company's or
     any Company Subsidiary's existing credit facilities in the ordinary course
     of business; (B) event of default or default under the Company's or any
     Subsidiary's existing credit facilities or outstanding loans; or



                                       19



<PAGE>


          (c) creation or assumption  by the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
     of any material Lien on any material asset, other than Permitted Liens;

          (iii) any material change in any method of financial accounting or
     financial accounting principle or practice used by the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries, other than such changes required by Law or a change in
     GAAP;

          (iv)  (A) any deferred compensation, severance or similar agreement
     entered into or amended by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
     employee; (B) any material increase in or acceleration of the compensation
     or benefits payable or to become payable by the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries to its directors or officers or generally applicable to all or
     any category of the Company's or any such Subsidiary's employees; (C) any
     material increase in the coverage or benefits available under any vacation
     pay, company awards, salary continuation or disability, sick leave,
     deferred compensation, bonus or other incentive compensation, insurance,
     pension or other employee benefit plan, payment or arrangement made to, for
     or with any of the directors or officers of the Company or any Subsidiary
     or generally applicable to all or any category of the Company's or any
     Subsidiary's employees; or (D) any Material Employment Agreement or any
     amendment to the same, other than increases in compensation in the ordinary
     course of business and that in the aggregate have not resulted in a
     material increase in the benefits or compensation expense of the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries;

          (v)   any loan, advance or capital contribution made by the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries to, or investment in, any Person other than loans,
     advances or capital contributions made to a Subsidiary;

          (vi)  any amendment, alteration or modification in any material term
     of any currently outstanding Company Options, warrants or other rights to
     purchase any capital stock or other equity interests in the Company or any
     securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible into the same; or

          (vii) any  agreement  to take or permit any actions  specified in this
     SECTION 4.9(B), except for this Agreement.

          Section 4.10  LITIGATION. As of the date hereof, there is no material
action, suit, claim, investigation, arbitration or proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties before any arbitrator,
arbitration provider or Governmental Authority (a "PROCEEDING"). As of the date
hereof, neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any officer,
director or employee of the Company or any such Subsidiary has been permanently
or temporarily enjoined by any Law from engaging in or continuing any conduct or
practice in connection with the business or assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company. To the knowledge of the Company as of the date
hereof, none of the Company, nor any Subsidiary of the Company, nor any officer,
director or employee of the Company or any such Subsidiary is under
investigation by any Governmental Authority related to the conduct of the
Company's or any such Subsidiary's business, the results of which investigation
reasonably could be materially adverse to the business or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          Section 4.11  TAXES.

          (a)   Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company:

          (i)   Within the times and in the manner prescribed by Law, the
     Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) have properly
     prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns required by Law, have timely paid
     all Taxes due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) and have
     timely withheld and deposited all Taxes required to be withheld and
     deposited. Tax Returns filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
     predecessors) are true, correct and complete, and include all statements
     and other information required to avoid penalties or additions to Tax. The
     Company and its Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) have complied with
     all Law relating to Taxes. The Company has made available to Parent and
     Merger Sub all federal and material state, local and foreign Tax Returns
     containing material elections of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
     with respect to periods commencing on or after January 31, 2002. Neither
     the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any of their predecessors) has
     either (A) been a party to a "reportable transaction" (as such term is
     defined in Treasury Regulations issued under the Code) that has not been
     properly reported on its Tax Returns, or (B) been a party to a "listed
     transaction" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations issued under
     the Code).

          (ii)  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any
     predecessor thereof) (A) is a party to or bound by any closing agreement,
     offer in compromise or any other agreement with any Tax authority or any
     Tax indemnity agreement, Tax sharing agreement or other agreement whereby
     amounts due thereunder are determined with reference to Taxes or items used
     to determine the amount of any Taxes, in each case, that is currently in
     effect; (B) has requested in writing a ruling or other advice or guidance
     from any Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes; (C) has present or
     contingent liabilities for Taxes, other than Taxes that either have been
     (1) incurred in the ordinary course of business thereof and reflected as a
     liability on the most recent balance sheet included in the Financial
     Statements or (2) incurred in the ordinary course of business with respect
     to taxable periods or portions of taxable periods following the date of the
     most recent balance sheet included in the Financial Statements in amounts
     consistent with prior years (adjusted for changes in ordinary course
     operating results and ordinary course changes in assets) and for which
     adequate reserves have been established and separately reflected in the
     financial records of the Company; or (D) that is subject to United States
     federal income taxation, has engaged in a trade or business, or had a
     permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable tax treaty),
     within a country other than the United States.

          (iii) There are no proposed, threatened or actual pending assessments,
     audits, examinations, disputes or requests from a Governmental Authority
     for filings or information pertaining to Taxes relating to the Company or
     any of its Subsidiaries (or their predecessors). There are no (A)
     adjustments under Section 481 of the Code or any similar adjustments with
     respect to the Company or any Subsidiary (or their predecessors) applicable
     to the current or any future taxable year of the Company or such



                                       21


<PAGE>


     Subsidiary, (B) waivers or extensions of the statute of limitations with
     respect to Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary could be held
     liable, or (C)grants by the Company or any Subsidiary of power of attorney
     to any Person with respect to Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary
     would be liable.

          (iv)  During any taxable year for which the applicable statute of
     limitations on the assessment of Tax against the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries remains open, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
     (nor any predecessor thereof) has been (A) a "distributing corporation," or
     a "controlled corporation" in connection with a distribution intended or
     purported to be governed by Section 355 of the Code, or (B) a member of an
     affiliated group of corporations, within the meaning of Section 1504 of the
     Code, or a member of a combined, consolidated or unitary group for state,
     local or foreign Tax purposes, other than such a group the common parent of
     which is and at all times has been the Company (or TSA Stores, Inc.) or a
     group that did not include as members entities other than the Company and
     its Subsidiaries (or TSA Stores, Inc. and its Subsidiaries).

          (v)   No Subsidiary of the Company (or predecessor thereof) that is
     not a United States person, as defined in the Code, is a passive foreign
     investment company within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, and
     neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a shareholder, directly or
     indirectly, in a passive foreign investment company, except, in each case,
     as is properly reflected in Tax Returns with respect to periods commencing
     on or after January 31, 2002. No Subsidiary of the Company (or any
     predecessor thereof) that is not a United States person as defined in the
     Code (x) is, or at any time has been, engaged in the conduct of a trade or
     business within the United States or treated as or considered to be so
     engaged and (y) has, or at any time has had, an investment in "United
     States property" within the meaning of Section 956(c) of the Code other
     than investments in United states property that are properly reflected in
     Tax Returns filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
     nor any Subsidiary is, or at any time has been, impacted by (A) the dual
     consolidated loss provisions of the Section 1503(d) of the Code, (B) the
     overall foreign loss provisions of Section 904(f) of the Code, or (C) the
     recharacterization provisions of Section 952(c)(2) of the Code, except for
     any such impacts that are properly reflected in Tax Returns filed by the
     Company or its Subsidiaries.

          (b)   (i) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company is not and has
not been a United States real property holding corporation at any time during
the applicable period specified in Code Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii), (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no interest in the stock in the Company constitutes a
United States real property interest pursuant to Section 897(c) of the Code, and
(iii) prior to Closing the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Parent an affidavit satisfying the requirements of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Parent.

          (c)   It is understood and agreed that the Company does not provide
any representations or warranties under this Agreement regarding Taxes, except
for those set forth in this SECTION 4.11 or SECTION 4.12.

          Section 4.12  ERISA.

          (a)   Section 4.12(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list
identifying as of the date hereof (i) all Employee Benefit Plans and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
retirement, health, life, or disability insurance, dependent care, severance and
other similar fringe or employee benefit plans or programs maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of or
relating to any employee or former employee (each such plan or program, an
"EMPLOYEE PLAN") and (ii) each Material Employment Agreement; provided, however,
that there shall be no obligation to disclose on Section 4.12(a) of the
Disclosure Letter any Employee Plan that is not material. The most recent copies
of each material Employee Plan and Material Employment Agreement (and, if
applicable, related trust agreements) and all amendments thereto have been made
available to Parent and Merger Sub together with, to the extent applicable, (A)
the two most recent annual reports (Form 5500 including applicable schedules and
financial reports) or ERISA alternative compliance statements prepared in

report prepared in connection with any such Employee Plan; (C) the most recent
summary plan description and any summaries of material modifications for each
such Employee Plan and (D) the most recent favorable IRS determination letter
for each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified pursuant to Section
401(a) of the Code.

          (b)       Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors,
maintains, contributes to or has an obligation to contribute to, has sponsored,
maintained, contributed to or been required to contribute to within the last
five years, or has any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to a
pension plan subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains,
contributes to or has an obligation to contribute to, has in the last five years
sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or incurred an obligation to contribute
to, or has any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any plan sponsored
by more than one employer within the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA
or Section 413(c) of the Code. There does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a material liability of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing.

          (c)   Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Employee Plan is so qualified, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of the most
recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters that could be reasonably
expected to adversely affect the tax-qualified status of any Plan. Each Employee
Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Plan. No prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code) has occurred in respect of any Employee Plan.

          (d)   There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering
any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates that,
individually or



                                       23
<PAGE>


collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.

          (e)   No payment, accrual of additional benefits, acceleration of
payments or vesting in any benefit under any Employee Plan or Material
Employment Agreement will be caused by the Company's entering into this
Agreement or by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other event).

          (f)   No Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) provides benefits to former employees of the
Company, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state
or local law.

          Section 4.13  LABOR MATTERS.

          (a)   There is no labor strike, dispute, slowdown, stoppage or lockout
actually pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Subsidiary and since August 4, 2003 there has not
been any such action.

          (b)   To the knowledge of the Company, no union claims to represent
the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining or similar
agreement with any labor organization, or work rules or practices agreed to with
any labor organization or employee association applicable to employees of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

          (c)   None of the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary are
represented by any labor organization and, to the Company's knowledge, there are
no current union organizing activities among the employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary.

          (d)   From the Balance Sheet Date, except as has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,
there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company or any
Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened before the
National Labor Relations Board or any similar state or foreign agency.

          Section 4.14  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

          (a)   The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and at all times
since the Balance Sheet Date has been, in compliance in all material respects
with all material Laws applicable to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses and activities.

          (b)   The Company and each Company Subsidiary has and maintains in
full force and effect, and is in compliance with, all Permits necessary for the
Company and each Subsidiary to carry on their respective businesses as currently
conducted and currently proposed to be conducted, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

the Company and its Subsidiaries based on the dollar value of materials or
products purchased by the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 2005. Since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been, and the
Company has not received any notice of or threatening, any material change in
relations with any of the major suppliers of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
the result of which would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

          Section 4.18  CONTRACTS.

          (a)   Section 4.18 of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list, as of the date hereof, of all Contracts (as hereinafter defined)
that are material Contracts within the meaning of Item 601 of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act or Contracts that the Company's management
considers material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
("MATERIAL CONTRACTS"). All of the Material Contracts are in full force and
effect, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used herein,
"CONTRACTS" means contracts, undertakings, commitments or agreements (other than
contracts, undertakings, commitments or agreements for employee benefit matters
set forth in Section 4.12(a) of the Disclosure Letter and real property leases
set forth in Section 4.20(c) of the Disclosure Letter and any vendor contracts
entered into in the ordinary course of business).

          (b)   True and complete copies of all written Material Contracts have
been either (i) filed as exhibits to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005 or (ii) delivered or made available
to Parent and Merger Sub. Each such Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of the Company (or the Subsidiaries party thereto) and enforceable
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Company's knowledge, the
other parties thereto in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, arrangement or
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of
equity, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (c)   As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, nor to the knowledge of the Company is any other party, in
material breach, default or violation (and no event has occurred or not occurred
through the Company's action or inaction or, to the knowledge of the Company,
through the action or inaction of any third parties, which with notice or the
lapse of time or both could constitute a breach, default or violation) of any
term, condition or provision of any Material Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is now a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

          (d)   With respect to each of the Company Joint Ventures, all
agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party that
contain (i) any change of control provisions, put options or call options
related to the interests in such Company Joint Venture, (ii) any rights of first
refusal or other similar provisions or (iii) any provisions that are reasonably



                                       26

likely to alter the Company's rights with respect to such Company Joint Venture
following consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case, have been disclosed in Section 4.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter and
true, correct and complete copies (or descriptions of oral agreements, if any)
of such agreements have been made available to Parent and Merger Sub. No Company
Joint Venture has any material liability for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may be held liable.

          Section 4.19  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Section 4.19 of the Disclosure
Letter sets forth the material Intellectual Property of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that have been registered with any Governmental Authority (or as to
which there are pending applications for registration). With respect to
Intellectual Property that is used in the conduct of the business of the Company
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company:

          (a)   the Company and its Subsidiaries own or have a valid right to
use all of their material Intellectual Property free and clear of all material
Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and there are no agreements or arrangements
by which any such Intellectual Property has been licensed to any third parties;

          (b)   to the Company's knowledge, no third party is materially
infringing the Company's Intellectual Property, the Company and its Subsidiaries
are not materially infringing any Intellectual Property of a third party, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in default (or with the giving of time
or lapse of notice would be in default) on any material license to use their
Intellectual Property; and

          (c)   no material claim has been asserted against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and is pending by any Person challenging the ownership or
use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their Intellectual Property,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries have not asserted any material claims
against any third parties challenging the use by third parties of their
Intellectual Property.

        Section 4.20  ASSETS AND PROPERTY.

          (a)   The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to or
a valid leasehold estate, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), in all real property and personal properties and assets reflected on the
Balance Sheet at the Balance Sheet Date or acquired after the Balance Sheet Date
(except for properties or assets subsequently sold, including real property
leases that are subsequently terminated, in the ordinary course of business).

          (b)   Section 4.20(b) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all real property owned in fee simple by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "OWNED REAL PROPERTY").
With respect to each such parcel of Owned Real Property: (i) there are no
leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other agreements, written or oral,
granting to any person the right of use or occupancy of any portion of such
parcel other than the Leases (as defined below); and (ii) there are no
outstanding rights of first refusal or options to purchase such parcel.

correct and complete list of all of the leases and subleases (the "LEASES") and
each leased and subleased parcel of real property in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a tenant, subtenant, landlord or sublandlord (collectively,

options to extend the term; and (ii) other than in respect of subleases, closed
stores and non-store properties, the current rent payable (including all

Subsidiary) holds a valid and existing leasehold or subleasehold interest or
landlord or sublandlord interest as applicable in the Leased Real Property,
under each of the Leases listed in Section 4.20(c) of the Disclosure Letter. The
Company has delivered or made available to Parent and Merger Sub true, correct
and complete copies of each of the Leases, including, without limitation, all
material amendments, modifications, side agreements, consents, subordination
agreements and guarantees. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company: (A) each Lease is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect; (B) each Lease will continue to be legal, valid, binding,
enforceable and in full force and effect on the same terms and conditions
following the Effective Time; (C) neither the Company (or its applicable
Subsidiary), nor, to the Company's knowledge, any other party to any Lease, has
received written notice of a material breach or default under any Lease, and to
the Company's knowledge, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
time, would constitute a breach or material default by the Company (or such
Subsidiary) or permit termination, modification or acceleration under any Lease
by any other party thereto; (D) there are no material disputes, oral agreements
or rent forbearance programs in effect as to any Lease; (E) the Company has not
assigned, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered any
interest in any Lease; (F) no Lease has been modified in any material respect,
except to the extent that such modifications are set forth in the documents

guaranty by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in full force and effect
and no default has occurred thereunder.

          (d)   The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property are
referred to collectively herein as the "REAL PROPERTY." To the knowledge of the
Company, each parcel of Real Property is in material compliance with all
existing material Laws applicable to such Real Property. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, (i) the Company has not received written notice
of any proceedings in eminent domain, condemnation or other similar proceedings
that are pending, and, to the Company's knowledge, there are no such proceedings
threatened, affecting any portion of the Real Property and (ii) the Company has
not received written notice of the existence of any outstanding writ,
injunction, decree, order or judgment or of any pending proceeding, and, to the
Company's knowledge, there is no such writ, injunction, decree, order, judgment
or proceeding threatened, relating to the ownership, lease, use, occupancy or
operation by any person of the Real Property.

          (e)   To the knowledge of the Company, there are no violations of any
covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, agreements or orders of any

compliance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (d) compliance
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act; (e) compliance with any

hereunder.

          Section 5.4   NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (a) contravene or conflict with the organizational or governing documents of

under or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any right or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub or to a loss of any material
benefit to which Parent or Merger Sub is entitled under any agreement, contract
or other instrument.

          Section 5.5   DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the
Company Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 will, (a) at the date it is first

Statement) or (b) at the time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any
information so provided by Parent or Merger Sub that subsequently changes or
becomes incomplete or incorrect to the extent such changes or failure to be

          Section 5.7   FINANCING. Parent and Merger Sub have delivered to the
Company financing letters from the following Persons: Green Equity Investors IV,
L.P. (the "GEI IV LETTER"), Banc of America Securities LLC and Bank of America,
N.A. and TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Management III, LLC and TCW/Crescent Mezzanine
Management IV, LLC (collectively, the "FINANCING LETTERS"), which together
reflect commitments from such equity investors and financial institutions, in
each case subject to the conditions set forth in the respective Financing
Letters, sufficient to pay the full Merger Consideration (and all other cash
amounts payable pursuant hereto), and all of the related fees and expenses
payable by Parent or Merger Sub (or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation) in connection with the Merger (the funds necessary to pay the
foregoing amounts, the "FINANCING"). Such Financing Letters are in full force
and effect and the parties thereto have not withdrawn or indicated an intent to
withdraw



                                       30



<PAGE>


the commitments made therein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, one or more Financing Letters may be superseded at the option of
Parent and Merger Sub after the date hereof but prior to the Effective Time by
instruments (the "NEW FINANCING LETTERS") which replace existing Financing
Letters and/or contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other
or additional parties; PROVIDED, that the terms of the New Financing Letters
shall not (a) expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth
in the Financing Letters in any respect that would make such conditions less
likely to be satisfied, (b) reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or (c)
otherwise have an adverse impact on the Company at any time that is prior to the
Closing. In such event, the term "FINANCING LETTERS" as used herein shall be
deemed to include the Financing Letters that are not so superseded at the time
in question and the New Financing Letters to the extent then in effect. There
are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
Financing other than as set forth or referred to in the Financing Letters.

          Section 5.8   NO OTHER INFORMATION. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
that the Company makes no representations or warranties as to any matter
whatsoever except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and specifically
(but without limitation) that the Company makes no representation or warranty
with respect to any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made
available to Parent and Merger Sub or to any of their respective Affiliates or
any representatives of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries or of the future business
and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

          Section 5.9   INTEREST IN COMPETITORS. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
owns any interest(s) (nor do any of their respective Affiliates insofar as such
Affiliate-owned interests would be attributed to Parent or Merger Sub under the
HSR Act) in any entity or Person that derives a substantial portion of its
revenues from a line of business within the Company's principal lines of
business.

          Section 5.10  OWNERSHIP OF COMMON SHARES. On the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub owns any shares of Common Stock of the Company.

          Section 5.11  SOLVENCY OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE
MERGER. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub,
immediately following the Effective Time and after giving effect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries will not (i) be insolvent (either because of its financial
condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the fair market
value of its assets or because the fair saleable value of its assets is less
than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts as
they mature), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
business or (iii) have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
due.

          Section 5.12  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Other than (i) the Contribution
and Exchange Agreements, (ii) the stockholders agreement among Parent and the
Contributing Holders and (iii) those certain amendments to the Contributing
Holders' respective Employment Agreements entered into by the Contributing
Holders and Merger Sub in connection with the Contribution and Exchange
Agreements, there are no Contracts between Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one



                                       31

hand, and members of the Company's management on the other hand. None of the
foregoing agreements requires any material performance or forbearance by the
Contributing Holders prior to the Effective Time.

cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective authorized representatives, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice (i) such access to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Company and such Subsidiaries (so

that Parent



                                       35



<PAGE>


or Merger Sub reasonably may request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent,
Merger Sub and their representatives shall not have access to any books, records
and other information the disclosure of which would, in the Company's good faith
opinion after consultation with legal counsel, result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege with respect to such books, records and other
information.

          (b)   The Company will and will cause its Subsidiaries to and will
request their respective representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent,
Merger Sub and their authorized representatives in connection with the

Parent or Merger Sub; PROVIDED, that any information provided to Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this SECTION 6.3 shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall not be required to
incur any significant expenses or become subject to any significant obligations
relating to such activities prior to the Closing.

          Section 6.4   SOLICITATION.

          (a)   During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 12:01 a.m. (EST) on the 21st day after the date of this
Agreement (the "EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD START DATE"), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors, affiliates and other representatives (such Persons, together with the
Subsidiaries of the Company, collectively, the "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES") shall
have the right (acting under the direction of the Special Committee) to: (i)
initiate, solicit and encourage Company Acquisition Proposals (as hereinafter
defined), including by way of providing access to non-public information
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements (as hereinafter defined); PROVIDED that the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access
which was not previously provided to Parent and Merger Sub; and (ii) enter into
and maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with respect to Company
Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in,
or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations.

          (b)   Subject to SECTION 6.4(C), and except as may relate to any
Person or group of related Persons from whom the Company has received, after the
date hereof and prior to the Exclusivity Period Start Date, a written indication
of interest that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee if such committee still exists) believes in good faith is bona
fide and could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) (each such Person or group, an "EXCLUDED PARTY"), from the
Exclusivity Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article X, the Company shall
not, and shall not direct, authorize or permit any of the Company
Representatives, and shall be responsible for noncompliance with the following
provisions by any of the foregoing, to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate,
solicit or encourage



                                       36



<PAGE>


(including by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise cooperate with
or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations or (B) accept a Company Acquisition Proposal or
enter into any agreement or agreement in principle (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) providing for or relating to a Company Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the
Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder. Subject to SECTION
6.4(C) and except as may relate to an Excluded Party, on the Exclusivity Period
Start Date the Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
conducted theretofore by the Company or any Company Representatives with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Company (A) shall not, and shall not permit any of the
Company Representatives to, provide any non-public information to any Excluded
Party without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
(B) will promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any Excluded
Party which was not previously provided to Parent and Merger Sub.

          (c)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in SECTION
6.4(B), if at any time prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the
Company has otherwise complied with its obligations under this SECTION 6.4 and
the Company has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third
party that the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee if such committee still exists) believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee if such committee still exists) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that
such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) after consultation with its outside
counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee if such committee still exists) determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company
Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, that the Company (A) will not, and will not
allow Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person without entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (B) will
promptly provide to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which
was not previously provided to Parent and Merger Sub and (C) will promptly
notify Parent and Merger Sub in the event it receives such Company Acquisition
Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity
of the party making such proposal or inquiry, and shall keep Parent and Merger
Sub reasonably informed as to the status and any material developments
concerning the same, including furnishing copies of any such written inquiries,
correspondence, draft documentation and written summaries of any material oral
inquiries or discussions. Nothing contained in this SECTION 6.4(C) shall
prohibit the



                                       37



<PAGE>


Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (in each case, acting through
the Special Committee if such committee still exists) from taking and disclosing
to the Company's stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure required by applicable Law.

          (d)   Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee
thereof of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any alternative Company Acquisition Proposal,
including any Permitted Alternative Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (any
action described in this CLAUSE (I) being referred to as an "ADVERSE
RECOMMENDATION CHANGE") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting
or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and, to the extent a Company Acquisition Proposal involves the
issuance of securities to stockholders of the Company, other than an appropriate
confidentiality agreement that allows the Company to receive and review
confidential information with respect to a proposed issuer of any such
securities) (a "COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"); PROVIDED, that the Company
shall not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement and entering into a
Permitted Alternative Agreement in accordance with SECTION 10.1(E).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee if such committee still exists) may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change if such Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel) that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.


          (e)   From and after the date hereof, the Company shall provide
notice promptly to Parent and Merger Sub of any resolution to take any of the
actions described in this SECTION 6.4 or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
SECTION 10.1(E).

          (f)   As used in this Agreement, the term:

                (i)     "ACCEPTABLE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT" means a
     confidentiality and standstill agreement that contains provisions that are
     no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in
     the Confidentiality Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that an Acceptable
     Confidentiality Agreement may include provisions that are less favorable to
     the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement so long
     as the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality



                                       38


<PAGE>


     Agreement, concurrently with execution of such Acceptable Confidentiality
     Agreement, to include substantially similar provisions for the benefit of
     LGP;

               (ii)     "COMPANY ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means any inquiry,
     proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent,
     Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates relating to any direct or
     indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 25% or more
     of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 25% or more of the outstanding Company
     Securities, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
     result in any Person or group of Persons beneficially owning 25% or more of
     the outstanding Company Securities, or any merger, reorganization,
     consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
     liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or
     any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes
     25% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
     its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); (iii) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a
     Company Acquisition Proposal (but changing the references to "25% or more"
     in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "50% or more") which
     the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee
     if it still exists) in good faith determines (based on such matters as it
     deems relevant, including the advice of its independent financial advisor
     and outside counsel), would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
     is more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the
     Company, (in their capacities as stockholders) than the transactions
     contemplated hereby.


                                   ARTICLE VII
                       COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

          Section 7.1   VOTING OF SHARES. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agree to
vote all Common Shares beneficially owned by it, and to cause all Common Shares
beneficially owned by any of their respective Affiliates that are (i) controlled
by Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) members of the Company's Board of Directors to
be voted, in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Shareholder
Meeting.

          Section 7.2   DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.

          (a)   The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of the
Company's and its respective Subsidiaries' obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) (i) the
present and former officers and directors thereof against any and all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
("DAMAGES"), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time to the
extent provided under the Company's or such Subsidiaries' respective
organizational and governing documents or agreements in effect on the date
hereof, including, without limitation, the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this



                                       39



<PAGE>


Agreement or arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) such persons and any other present or former employee
of the Company against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in
connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary
in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such obligations shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the
Surviving Corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws from the Effective
Time until the expiration of the applicable statue of limitations with respect
to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether the
conduct of an individual seeking indemnification has complied with the standards
set forth under applicable Law shall be made by independent counsel mutually
acceptable to the Surviving Corporation and such individual. For a period of six
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of officers' and directors' liability
insurance maintained on the date hereof by the Company and its respective
Subsidiaries (the "CURRENT POLICIES"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Surviving
Corporation may, and in the event of the cancellation or termination of such
policies shall, substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially
sound carriers providing at least the same coverage and amount and containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered persons (the
"REPLACEMENT POLICIES") in respect of claims arising from facts or events that
existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time under the Current
Policies; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend annually in excess of 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company under the Current Policies; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent may
direct the Company to purchase "tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage
no less favorable than the coverage described above, PROVIDED that the Company
shall not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to
the Closing.

          (b)   This SECTION 7.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present
or former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns, and the agreements and
covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other
rights to which any such present or former director or officer is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights
to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this SECTION 7.2 is not prior to
or in substitution for any such claims under any such policies.

          (c)   If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity or (ii) transfers or conveys
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each
case to the extent reasonably necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this SECTION 7.2.

          Section 7.3   FINANCING EFFORTS. Parent and Merger Sub shall use all
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Letters. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Company (approved by the Special Committee), amend, modify or supplement
(including in the definitive documents) (i) any of the conditions or
contingencies to funding contained in the Financing Letters or (ii) any other
provision of the Financing Letters, in either case to the extent such amendment,
modification or supplement would have the effect of amending, modifying or
supplementing the conditions or contingencies to funding in a manner adverse to
the Company or the holders of Common Shares. In the event that any portion of
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters becomes unavailable
otherwise than due to the material breach of representations and warranties or
covenants of the Company or a failure of a condition to be satisfied by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use all reasonable best efforts to arrange
alternative Financing from the same or other sources on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the
Financing Letters as of the date hereof. Parent and Merger Sub shall use all
reasonable best efforts to satisfy on or before the Closing all requirements of
the definitive agreements pursuant to which the Financing will be obtained.
Parent and Merger Sub shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material
developments relating to the Financing.

          Section 7.4   SOLVENCY OPINION. The parties shall, at the expense of
the Surviving Corporation, retain a nationally recognized investment banking or
valuation firm to render a solvency opinion of customary scope and substance as
of the Closing to the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub.


                                  ARTICLE VIII
                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

          The parties hereto agree that:

          Section 8.1   REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including SECTION 6.4), each party will use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or
cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including obtaining all necessary consents, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, Permits or orders from all Governmental Authorities or other
Persons; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalties
or other consideration to any landlord or other third party to obtain any
consent or approval required for the consummation of the Merger under any real
estate leases or other material contracts (other than de minimis amounts or if
Parent and Merger Sub have provided adequate assurance of repayment). Each party
shall also refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure of any of the conditions to the Merger
in this Agreement being satisfied or restrict such party's ability to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
foregoing, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i)
to take all action necessary so that no takeover, anti-takeover, moratorium,
"fair price," "control share" or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) if any such Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take
all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this



                                       41



<PAGE>


Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

               Section 8.2   CERTAIN FILINGS.

          (a)   The parties shall cooperate with one another (i) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from any parties to any Contracts, in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in
seeking and obtaining any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making
any such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or
with the Company Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the conditions to the parties' respective obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to those conditions specified
in Article IX. The parties shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent reasonably practicable each will consult the other on, all the
information relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries that
appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify and provide a copy to the other party of any substantive written
communication received from any Governmental Authority with respect to any
filing or submission or with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the
other reasonable prior notice of any substantive communication with, and any
proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Authority regarding any such filing or any such transaction. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall, nor shall they permit their respective representatives to,
participate independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and without giving, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity of the other party to attend or
participate. The parties to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearance, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party to this Agreement in connection with proceedings under or related to
the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws.

          (b)   The parties (i) shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken (A) all actions necessary, proper or
advisable by such party with respect to the prompt preparation and filing with
the SEC of the Company Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, (B) such actions
as may be required to have the Company Proxy Statement and any related materials
cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable, and (C) such actions
as may be required to be taken under the Exchange Act and state securities or
applicable Blue Sky Laws in connection with the Merger; and (ii) shall promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions and filings, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all
material Permits from any Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
Merger (including, without limitation, any filing under the HSR Act or any
applicable Other Antitrust Law), including (1) responding as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of



                                       42



<PAGE>


Justice for additional information or documentation; and (2) complying with the
requirements of, and responding as promptly as reasonably practicable to all
inquiries and requests received from any Governmental Authority in connection
with, the HSR Act or Other Antitrust Laws related to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 8.3   PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. So long as this Agreement is in
effect, the parties will consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any press release or public
statement as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the
New York Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the consent of the other parties (not to be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).

          Section 8.4   FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets of the Company.

          Section 8.5   NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Each of the parties hereto
shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly notify the other party of:

          (a)   the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to cause any representation
or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect;

          (b)   any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any
event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would reasonably be expected to
cause the failure by such party to comply with or satisfy, any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;

          (c)   the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person, which consent is or
could reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
or the operation of their businesses, is or may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

          (d)   the receipt by such party of any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

          (e)   its learning of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced against, or affecting such party that, if they were
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be disclosed
pursuant to this Agreement or which relate to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 8.6   DISPOSITION OF LITIGATION. The Company will keep Parent
and Merger Sub reasonably apprised of all important developments relating to,
and consult with Parent and Merger Sub with respect to, any action by any third
party to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to SECTION 6.4, will
use reasonable best efforts to resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or
otherwise oppose the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub may participate in (but not control) the
defense of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its Directors
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at Parent and Merger
Sub's sole cost and expense (subject to SECTION 10.2). In addition, subject to
SECTION 6.4, the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to
resist any such effort to restrain or prohibit or otherwise oppose the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 8.7   EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

          (a)   For all purposes (other than benefit accrual under final
average pay defined benefit pension plans) under the employee benefit plans of
the Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to each current and former
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") after the
Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS"), except as would result in a duplication of
benefits, each Company Employee shall be credited with all years of service for
which such Company Employee was credited before the Effective Time under any
similar Employee Plans. In addition and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan
in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the "OLD PLANS"); and (ii) for purposes of each
New Plan providing medical, dental, disability, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

          (b)   For a period of one year from the Effective Time, Parent shall
honor, fulfill and discharge the Company's and its Subsidiaries' obligations
under the severance plans listed on Section 8.7(b) of the Disclosure Letter
without any amendment or change that is adverse to the Company Employees. During
the period specified above, severance benefits offered to Company Employees
shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after the
Effective Time in the compensation paid to Company Employees and used to
determine severance benefits.

          Section 8.8   CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT. The parties acknowledge that
the Company, and LGP entered into the Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement
shall be deemed incorporated herein as if it were set forth in its entirety, and
the Confidentiality Agreement shall



                                       44



<PAGE>


continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier
of (a) the Effective Time or (b) the expiration of the Confidentiality Agreement
according to its terms.


                                   ARTICLE IX
                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

Shareholder Vote;

          (c)   No Law shall be in effect which prohibits, restrains or renders
illegal the consummation of the Merger.

the satisfaction or valid waiver of the following further conditions:

all of its obligations hereunder required to be performed by it at or prior to
the Effective Time; (ii) the representations and warranties (A) set forth in
SECTION 4.5 shall be true and correct in all respects (except for inaccuracies
that are de minimis in the aggregate) as of the Effective Time as if made at and
as of such time and (B) set forth in ARTICLE IV, other than those described in

as if made at and as of such time (without giving effect to any qualification as

case of this CLAUSE (B) where the failure to be so true and correct does not

representations made as of a specific date shall be required to be so true and
correct (subject to such qualifications) as of such date only; and (iii) Parent
and Merger Sub shall have received a certificate signed by a senior officer of

          (b)   Parent and Merger Sub have obtained the Financing (other than

Parent or Merger Sub of their respective obligations under SECTION 7.3; and

          (c)   the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock at the Effective
Time, the holders of which have demanded appraisal of their shares from the

          (a)   Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material

senior officer of Parent and Merger Sub attesting to (a) and (b) above.


                                    ARTICLE X
                                   TERMINATION

          Section 10.1  TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding
any prior approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company):

          (a)   by mutual written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand;

          (b)   by either the Company or Merger Sub, if:

               (i)     the Merger has not been consummated by the End Date,
          provided that the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such date
          is not the result of, or caused by, the failure of the party seeking
          to exercise such termination right to fulfill any of its obligations
          under this Agreement;

               (ii)     there shall be any final and nonappealable Law that
          makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited;
          PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
          to this SECTION 10.1(B)(II) shall not be available to any party whose
          breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the application
          or imposition of such Law; or

               (iii)    at the Company Shareholder Meeting or any adjournment
          thereof at which this Agreement has been voted upon, the Company
          shareholders fail to approve this Agreement by the Requisite
          Shareholder Vote;

          (c)   by the Company, if a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement



                                       46



<PAGE>


shall have occurred which would cause any of the conditions set forth in
SECTIONS 9.3(A) or (B) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of
being satisfied by the End Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company is not then
in material breach of this Agreement;

          (d)   by Parent or Merger Sub, if:

               (i)     a breach of or failure to perform any representation,
          warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth
          in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any of the
          conditions set forth in SECTION 9.2(A) not to be satisfied, and such
          condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; PROVIDED,
          HOWEVER, that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach
          of this Agreement;

               (ii)     the Board of Directors of the Company shall make an
          Adverse Recommendation Change or approve a resolution or authorize or
          agree to do so; or

               (iii)   the Company shall have entered into a Company Acquisition
          Agreement;

          (e)   by the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Shareholder Vote, upon the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee but only if such committee still exists) resolving to enter
into, subject to the terms of this Agreement, including SECTION 6.4, a
definitive agreement containing a Company Acquisition Proposal; PROVIDED, that
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee
but only if such committee still exists) shall not so resolve unless (A) the
Company shall have complied with its obligations under SECTION 6.4, (B) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel) that
such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the
failure to take such action is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of the Company to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and (C) the Company shall have substantially negotiated and
documented the terms of such Company Acquisition Proposal; (ii) immediately
following the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the Special
Committee) so resolving, the Company shall have so notified Parent and provided
to Parent in writing the identity of the Person making, and the final terms and
conditions of, such Company Acquisition Proposal; and (iii) the Company shall
have the right to enter into such a definitive agreement (a "PERMITTED
ALTERNATIVE AGREEMENT") so long as (A) the effectiveness of such agreement is
conditioned upon the Company complying with its obligations under SECTION 10.2,
(B) the effectiveness of such agreement is conditioned upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 10.1(E) and (C) immediately following
the execution of such agreement, a copy of such agreement and all related
agreements, exhibits, schedules and other documents are delivered to Parent and
Merger Sub.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Sections 10.1(B)
through (E) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with SECTION 11.1 of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
termination by the Company shall be effective unless and



                                       47



<PAGE>


until the Company shall have paid any amounts required to be paid by the Company
pursuant to SECTION 10.2.


          Section 10.2  TERMINATION FEE. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to either SECTION
10.1(D)(III) or SECTION 10.1(E), then the Company shall immediately pay to
Parent and Merger Sub, collectively, a break-up fee of $30,000,000 (the
"TERMINATION Fee"). In addition, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
SECTION 10.1(B)(III), then the Company shall immediately pay to Parent and
Merger Sub, collectively, all of Parent's and Merger Sub's actual and reasonably
documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) actually incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates on
or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount shall not be greater
than $5,000,000 (the "PARENT EXPENSES"); PROVIDED that, if Parent's and Merger
Sub's actual and reasonably incurred and documented out-of-pocket expenses
exceed $5,000,000 as a result of their good faith efforts to satisfy the
conditions set forth in ARTICLE IX and their compliance with the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement, then the Company shall negotiate in good
faith with Parent with respect to increasing the amount of such expenses that
are reimbursed by the Company . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to SECTION 10.1(B)(III) and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting a Company Acquisition Proposal has been made public and not
withdrawn, then in the event that, within twelve months after such termination,
either (A) the acquisition of more than 50% of the voting securities of the
Company occurs or (B) the Company enters into a definitive agreement in respect
of such a transaction, which transaction is subsequently consummated (whether
within the twelve month period described above or thereafter), then in either
case the Company shall immediately pay to Parent and Merger Sub, collectively,
the Termination Fee (less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid by
the Company to Parent and Merger Sub). The parties hereto agree that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated Damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. The parties further agree that in the event any
payment of the Termination Fee is made by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this SECTION 10.2, the Termination Fee paid shall be the exclusive
remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub and, upon payment of such amounts by
the Company, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder.

          Section 10.3  EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to SECTION 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except (i)
SECTIONS 10.2, 10.3, 11.1, 11.4, 11.6 and 11.11 will survive the termination
hereof and (ii) with respect to any liabilities for Damages incurred or suffered
by a party as a result of the willful and material breach by any other party of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth
in this Agreement.

writing delivered pursuant hereto shall survive until (but not beyond) the
Effective Time. None of the representations and warranties herein shall be
considered modified, vitiated or waived in regard to any matter by any due
diligence review or research conducted by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub,
unless such matter is contained in the Disclosure Letter or an amendment to such
representation and warranty adopted pursuant to SECTION 11.3(A). This SECTION
11.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms
contemplates performance in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

          Section 11.3  AMENDMENTS NO WAIVERS.

          (a)   Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior
to the Effective Time only by amendment or waiver in writing and signed, (i) in
the case of an amendment to this Agreement, by the Company (approved by the
Special Committee), Parent and Merger Sub, or (ii) in the case of a waiver, by
the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
after the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, any
proposed amendment that by Law requires further approval by the shareholders of
the Company shall not be effective without such further shareholder approval.

          (b)   At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may but will have no
obligation to, or to consider, with respect to the other parties hereto (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
such party and (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
of such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto.

          (c)   No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as expressly set

cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies herein provided or
available at Law or in equity.

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate

                                       50



<PAGE>


obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties
hereto. Any purported assignment in violation of these provisions shall be null
and void AB INITIO.

          Section 11.6  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the conflicts or choice of law principles of such states.

          Section 11.7  COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS; THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.
This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signatures and in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the
signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement
shall become effective only when actually signed by each party hereto and each
such party has received counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. No provision of this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or with
respect hereto, except with respect to the matters provided in SECTIONS 2.3, 2.4
and 7.2.

          Section 11.8  SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any
Law, or due to any public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

          Section 11.9  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the Merger, will cause irreparable injury to the other
parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy.
Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by
any court of competent jurisdiction to compel performance of such party's
obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, in addition to any other rights or
remedies available hereunder or at law or in equity.

          Section 11.10 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to its subject matter and
supersedes all oral or written prior or contemporaneous agreements and
understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter.

          Section 11.11 JURISDICTION.

          (a)   Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle or, if
such court does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of such




                                       51



<PAGE>


proceeding or if such jurisdiction is not available, in the United State
District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or
proceeding in any of those courts or that any suit, action or proceeding which
is brought in any of those courts has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Process in any suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any of the named
courts.

          (b)   EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

THE OPTIONS AND THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK SUBSCRIBED FOR BY THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH OPTIONS WILL NOT BE
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR ANY STATE SECURITIES

EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE. TRANSFER OF SUCH OPTIONS AND
SHARES IS ALSO RESTRICTED BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND BY THE TERMS OF THE
STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT WITH SLAP SHOT HOLDINGS CORP.

    OPTION ASSUMPTION, CONTRIBUTION AND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

      This OPTION ASSUMPTION, CONTRIBUTION AND SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (this
"AGREEMENT"), dated as of January 22, 2006, is entered into by and between
___________, an individual (the "INVESTOR"), and Slap Shot Holdings Corp., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT").

      Parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary, SAS Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("MERGER SUB"), have been formed solely for purposes of effectuating
the Merger (as defined below) and will engage in no activities other than those
incident to the Merger;

      Investor currently is (i) a stockholder in The Sports Authority, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), the owner of shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY SHARES") and/or (ii) a holder of
options ("COMPANY OPTIONS") to acquire Company Shares;

      In connection with that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
January 22, 2006 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and among the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "MERGER"),
with the Company as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION");

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Investor desires to
(i) make contributions to Parent of Company Shares and/or cash and/or (ii) have
Company Options assumed and amended by Parent, in each case, in such amounts as
are set forth under the captions "Rollover Shares," "Cash Contribution" "and
Rollover Options," respectively, on SCHEDULE 1 to this Agreement (upon
completion of such Schedule pursuant to Section 1.7 below) and with an aggregate
value of not less than the amount set forth under the caption "Aggregate
Investment" on SCHEDULE 1 (as it appears on the date hereof, but subject to
Section 1.7);

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties desire
that with respect to any Company Shares owned by Investor that are set forth in
the final version of SCHEDULE 1 under the caption "Rollover Shares" (the
"ROLLOVER SHARES"), immediately prior to the Merger, Investor shall contribute
such Rollover Shares to Parent (the "EQUITY CONTRIBUTION") in exchange for (i)
newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the
"COMMON SHARES") and/or (ii) newly issued shares of (a) series A preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the "SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES")
and (b) series B preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the
"SERIES B PREFERRED SHARES" and, together with the

<PAGE>

Common Shares and Series A Preferred Shares, the "SHARES"), in each case, in the
amount set forth under the caption "Equity Contribution Shares" in the final
version of SCHEDULE 1 attached hereto (the Shares received in exchange for the
Equity Contribution are referred to herein as the "EQUITY CONTRIBUTION SHARES");

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties desire
that with respect to any Company Options owned by Investor that are set forth in
the final version of SCHEDULE 1 under the caption "Rollover Options" (the
"ROLLOVER OPTIONS"), immediately following the consummation of the Merger, such
Rollover Options shall be (i) assumed by Parent (and become exercisable for
Common Shares) and (ii) amended, such that, after giving effect to such
amendments, the number of option shares and exercise price per option share of
such options shall be as set forth under the caption "Amended Options" in the
final version of SCHEDULE 1 (such amended options are referred to herein as the
"AMENDED OPTIONS");

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties desire
that with respect to any cash amount that is set forth in the final version of
SCHEDULE 1 under the caption "Cash Contribution," immediately prior to the
Merger, Investor shall contribute such amount in cash to Parent (the "CASH
CONTRIBUTION") in exchange for (i) newly issued Common Shares and/or (ii) newly
issued Series A Preferred Shares and newly issued Series B Preferred Shares, in
each case, in the amount set forth under the caption "Cash Contribution Shares"
in the final version of SCHEDULE 1 (the Shares received in exchange for the Cash
Contribution are referred to herein as the "CASH CONTRIBUTION SHARES");

      For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
Equity Contribution and the Cash Contribution, as applicable, taken together
with (i) the contribution of securities and/or cash by other investors to
Parent, and (ii) the contribution by affiliates of Parent of cash to Parent,
will qualify as transfers described in Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), (b) none of the Shares received in
connection with those transfers will be treated as other property or money
within the meaning of Section 351(b) of the Code, and (c) with respect to the
Rollover Options and Amended Options, (i) the amendment and assumption of such
Rollover Options not be treated as a taxable event, and (ii) the Amended Options
be subject to taxation as options to which Section 421 of the Code does not
apply, in accordance with the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 83 of
the Code; and

      In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, Parent, certain affiliates of Parent,
Investor and certain other holders of Company Shares and Company Options will
enter into a Stockholders Agreement with terms and conditions substantially
similar to those described in EXHIBIT B-1 hereto (the "STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT").

      NOW, THEREFORE, in order to implement the foregoing and in consideration
of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows.



                                       2
<PAGE>

     1. OPTION ASSUMPTION, CONTRIBUTION AND SUBSCRIPTION.

     1.1 ASSUMPTION, CONTRIBUTION AND SUBSCRIPTION. The parties hereby agree
that the following transactions shall occur and be deemed effective as follows:

         (a) As of the Closing, on the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Parent shall issue to Investor, the number and class of Shares (if any) set
forth under the caption "Equity Contribution Shares" in the final version of
SCHEDULE 1 in exchange for the Equity Contribution by the Investor of the
Rollover Shares.

         (b) Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein, Parent shall assume the Company's obligations
with respect to the Rollover Options (if any) set forth under the caption
"Rollover Options" in the final version of SCHEDULE 1 and the terms of such
Rollover Options shall be amended as follows:

             (i) such that, after giving effect to such amendments, the number
     of option shares and exercise price per option share of such options shall
     be as set forth under the caption "Amended Options" in the final version of
     SCHEDULE 1;

             (ii) to provide (if not already provided) for the exercise price of
     such option to be paid by one or more certificates evidencing Shares of any
     class owned by Investor immediately prior to such exercise, together with a
     duly executed stock power tendering such Shares with an aggregate fair
     market value on the date on which the applicable exercise notice is given
     equal to the aggregate exercise price set forth in such exercise notice;
     PROVIDED that such Shares have been held by Investor for at least six
     months (or such greater or lesser period required by Parent) or have such
     other characteristics as are necessary in order to prevent Parent or the
     Surviving Corporation from incurring an accounting charge on account of the
     use of such Shares to pay the purchase price (such Shares being referred to
     hereinafter as "MATURE SHARES"); and

             (iii)to provide (if not already provided) that, upon exercise,
     Investor may elect to satisfy any required income and employment tax
     withholding by having Parent (or any of its affiliates) withhold from the
     delivery of Common Shares upon such exercise a number of Common Shares with
     a fair market value (determined in the same manner as is used in computing
     the amount of gain reported upon such exercise for tax purposes) equal to
     the amount of such required withholding;

     PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that with respect to the amendments described in clauses
     (ii) and (iii) above, if at the time of exercise of any Amended Option (x)
     the payment of the exercise price with Mature Shares or (y) the
     satisfaction of the applicable tax withholding by Parent (or its
     affiliates) withholding Common Shares would violate any provision of any
     debt agreement or other material agreement binding on Parent, the Surviving
     Corporation or any of their subsidiaries), then the applicable amendment
     shall not be effective as to such Amended Option at such time.

     The Amended Options shall be fully and immediately exercisable upon
consummation of the transactions described in this Section 1.1(b). An example of
the option assumption and amendment mechanics is set forth on EXHIBIT D hereto.



                                       3
<PAGE>

         (c) As of the Closing, on the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Parent shall issue to Investor, the Cash Contribution Shares (if any) in the
number and class set forth under the caption "Cash Contribution Shares" in the
final version of SCHEDULE 1 in exchange for the Cash Contribution by the
Investor (if any). The contributions, subscriptions and amendments described in
this Section 1.1 are hereinafter referred to as the "TRANSACTIONS").

     1.2 CLOSING. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Section 1.4, the closing (the "CLOSING") of the Transactions shall
occur and be deemed effective immediately prior to the closing of the Merger;
provided that the assumption and amendment of the Rollover Options described in
Section 1.1(b) shall occur and be deemed effective immediately following the
consummation of the Merger. The Closing shall take place at the offices Gibson,
Dunn & Crutcher LLP located in Los Angeles, California, or such other place
determined by the parties.

     1.3 FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THE MERGER. In the event that, after the
Transactions have occurred, the Merger is not consummated for any reason
whatsoever and the Merger Agreement is terminated, the parties hereto agree that
concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement, regardless of the
price at which the Company Shares are quoted at that time on the New York Stock
Exchange or any other national securities exchange on which the common stock of
the Company is listed, (i) Parent shall return to Investor the Rollover Shares
and Cash Contribution, as applicable, (ii) Investor shall return to Parent the
Equity Contribution Shares and Cash Contribution Shares, as applicable, (iii)
the proposed assumption of and amendments to the Rollover Options shall be of no
further force or effect and (iv) subject to compliance with clause (i) and (ii)
above, this Agreement shall be considered null and void and of no further force
or effect and no party shall have any liability to the other with respect to
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event, Investor shall have
no claim against Parent other than the right to receive such Rollover Shares and
Cash Contribution, as applicable, upon return of the Equity Contribution Shares
and/or Cash Contribution Shares.

     1.4 CONDITIONS TO CLOSING. The effectiveness of the Transactions shall be
subject to the following conditions unless waived in writing by the party

and Series B Preferred Shares received by the Investor pursuant to this
Agreement shall be of the same class and series of stock as each of the Common

Merger over the aggregate exercise price of such Amended Option will not exceed
(B) the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the Company Shares subject

the aggregate exercise price of such Rollover Option and (ii) on a share by
share comparison, the ratio of the exercise price to the fair market value of

consummation of the Merger will not be greater than the ratio of the exercise
price to the fair market value of the Company Shares subject to such Rollover
Option immediately before the consummation of the Merger.

represents and warrants to Parent as of the date hereof and as of the Closing
Date as follows.

acknowledges to Parent as follows.

     4.1 NO REGISTRATION. Investor understands and agrees that the Shares and
the Amended Options (and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Amended
Options), are being, or will be, acquired by Investor in a transaction not
involving any public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act, in
reliance on an exemption therefrom. Investor understands that the Shares and the
Amended Options (and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Amended Options),
have not been, and will not be, approved or disapproved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission or by any other federal or state agency, and that no such
agency has passed on the accuracy or adequacy of disclosures made to Investor by
Parent. No federal or state governmental agency has passed on or made any
recommendation or endorsement of the Shares or the Amended Options (or the
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Amended Options) or an investment in
Parent.

     4.2 LIMITATIONS ON DISPOSITION AND RESALE. Investor understands and
acknowledges that the Shares and the Amended Options (and the Shares issuable
upon exercise of the Amended Options), have not been and will not be registered
under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state and, unless the
Shares are so registered, they may not be offered, sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction
not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable securities laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction. Investor
understands that it may not be possible for Investor to liquidate Investor's
investment in Parent; and Investor agrees not to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Shares or the Amended Options (or the Shares issuable upon
exercise of the Amended Options), unless the Shares or the Amended Options have
been so registered or an exemption from the requirement of registration is
available under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.
Investor further acknowledges and agrees that his or her ability to dispose of
the Shares and the Amended Options (and the Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Amended Options), will be subject to restrictions contained in the Stockholders
Agreement. Investor recognizes that there will not be any public trading market
for the Shares and, as a result, Investor may be unable to sell or dispose of
its interest in Parent. Investor further acknowledges and agrees that, except as
may be set forth in the Stockholders Agreement, Parent shall have no obligation
to register the Shares or the Amended Options.

     4.3 LEGEND. (a) Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Amended Options
will bear the legend set forth in Section 7.4 of the Stockholders Agreement
(with such changes as may necessary to reflect the fact that security so
legended is an option and not a Share).

         (b) Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Shares received in
pursuant to this Agreement and any Shares received upon exercise of the Amended
Options represented by physical certificates will bear the legend set forth in
Section 7.4 of the Stockholders Agreement.



                                       9

     4.4 INFORMATION REGARDING PARENT. Investor acknowledges that (a) Parent has
made available to Investor, a reasonable time prior to the date of this
Agreement, information concerning Parent sufficient for Investor to make an
informed decision regarding an investment in the Shares and an opportunity to
ask questions and receive answers concerning the Shares; (b) Parent has made
available to Investor, a reasonable time prior to the date of this Agreement,
the opportunity to obtain any additional information that Parent possesses or
can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense deemed necessary by Investor
to verify the accuracy of the information provided, and has received all such
additional information requested; and (c) except for information contained in
documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior
to the date hereof and information provided by Parent to Investor contained, or
described, in the Stockholders Agreement and this Agreement, including, without
limitation EXHIBITS B-1 through B-3 hereto, Investor has not relied on Parent,
the Company or any of their respective affiliates, officers, employees or
representatives in connection with Investor's investigation or the accuracy of
the information provided or in making any investment decision.

     4.5 COMPLIANCE WITH AGREEMENT. Investor agrees to execute any and all
further documents reasonably necessary to become an optionholder and a
stockholder of Parent. Investor agrees to execute and deliver any and all
further documents and writings, and to perform such other actions, as may be or
become reasonably necessary or expedient to effect and carry out the terms of
this Agreement.

     4.6 IRREVOCABLE SUBSCRIPTION AND CANCELLATION. Each of Investor and Parent
understands that this subscription is irrevocable, except as expressly provided
herein or otherwise provided in any applicable federal or state law governing
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.

     4.7. TAX WITHHOLDING AND COOPERATION. Investor understands and agrees that
Parent or its affiliates and successors (including the Company) may withhold
taxes required by law to be withheld, and may withhold such taxes from the
proceeds of the Transactions, the Merger or other amounts due to the Investor
pertaining to the Equity Contribution Shares, Cash Contribution Shares or
Amended Options (or any successor securities), and may condition the issuance of
Shares or amendment of the Rollover Options (or successor securities) or the
sale thereof upon the payment by Investor to Parent or its affiliates and
successors of all applicable withholding taxes. Investor will cooperate as
reasonably requested by Parent with respect to Parent's and its affiliates' and
successors' compliance with applicable tax laws pertaining to such securities.
Investor shall be liable for and timely pay all taxes imposed on Investor with
respect to the Transactions and with respect to such securities (whether upon
receipt, exercise, sale or otherwise), and promptly following request from
Parent (or its successors) shall provide proof of such payment in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (or its successors).

     4.9 PURCHASER REPRESENTATIVE. If Investor used the services of a Purchaser
Representative (as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act) in connection with
the Transactions, such Purchaser Representative has disclosed or will disclose,
by submitting to Parent a Purchaser Representative Questionnaire in the form
given Investor by Parent, any material relationship which now exists between
each Purchaser Representative or its affiliates and Parent, the Company and
their respective affiliates, or which is mutually understood to be contemplated,
or which has existed at any time during the previous two (2) years, and further



                                       10
<PAGE>

setting forth any compensation received or to be received as a result of such
relationship. To the extent Investor has appointed a Purchaser Representative
and such Purchaser Representative may be an officer, director or employee of the
Company, Investor acknowledges and agrees that such Purchaser Representative has
acted as such solely in an individual capacity and not as an officer, director,
employee or representative of the Company.

     5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in
accordance with the law of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made
and to be performed entirely in such state. If any provision of this Agreement
or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of that provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby, and that provision shall be enforced to the greater extent permitted by
law.

     6. ASSIGNMENT. Investor shall have neither the right nor the power to
assign or delegate any provision of this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion). Except as
provided in the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties' respective successors, assigns,
executors and administrators.

     7. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which shall constitute one
and the same document.

     8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and may be
amended only in a writing executed by the party to be bound thereby.

     9. TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. This Agreement may be terminated: (i) by the
mutual written consent of the parties hereto or (ii) by either party if the
Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever.

     10. OTHER MANAGEMENT PARTIES. Each Management Party (as defined in the
Stockholders Agreement) other than Investor has entered (or will enter) into an
Option Assumption, Contribution and Subscription Agreement with Parent
containing terms and conditions identical to the terms and conditions contained
in this Agreement (other than variances in the amounts set forth on Schedule 1
to each such agreement).

     11. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the terms and conditions provided
herein, each party hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable, whether under applicable laws and
regulations or otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                    AMENDMENT

          Section 7.1 AMENDMENT OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. The Corporation
reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in
this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by
the laws of the State of Delaware, and all rights conferred herein are granted
subject to this reservation.

          Section 7.2 AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of
Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the

                   LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS

          Section 8.1 NO PERSONAL LIABILITY. To the fullest extent permitted by
the DGCL as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, no director of the
Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders
for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

          Section 8.2 INDEMNIFICATION. The Corporation shall indemnify to the
full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware as from time to time
in effect any person against all liability and expense (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation,
he is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
partner or trustee of, or in any similar managerial or fiduciary position of, or
as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, association or other enterprise, or by reason of any action alleged to
have been taken or omitted in such capacity. Expenses (including

                                       3
<PAGE>

attorneys' fees) incurred in defending an action, suit, or proceeding may be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit, or proceeding to the full extent and under the circumstances permitted by
Delaware law. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent of
the Corporation against any liability asserted against and incurred by such
person in any such capacity or arising out of such person's position, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify against such liability
under the provisions of this Article VIII. The indemnification provided by this
Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those
indemnified may be entitled under this Certificate of Incorporation, any bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, statute, or
otherwise, and shall inure to the benefit of their heirs, executors, and
administrators. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to
preclude the Corporation from indemnifying other persons from similar or other
expenses and liabilities as the Board of Directors or the stockholders may
determine in a specific instance or by resolution of general application.

          Section 8.3 AMENDMENT OR REPEAL. Any amendment, alteration or repeal
of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of an indemnitee or its
successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such
right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
amendment or repeal.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 CORPORATE POWER

          The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred on stockholders
herein are granted subject to this reservation.
