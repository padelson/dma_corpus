of  the Closing, such lesser number of trading days between the date hereof 
and the date which is two days prior to the Closing Date).   "EXCHANGE
RATIO" shall mean the Company Exchange Ratio, the Series  A Exchange Ratio or

the denominator of which  is $13.00, if the Average Stock Price is greater
than $65.00 per share  but less than $78.00 per share, or (C) 4,200,000, if
the Average Stock  Price is equal to or greater than $78.00 per

accordance  with Section IV.C.3 of the Company\'s Certificate of

Ratio shall be determined as follows:   (i) If the Series A Election Notice
specifies that the holder  will convert its shares of Series A Preferred
Stock in accordance with  Section IV.C.5.(a) of the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation, or if  the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock fails to
timely file such  election, then the Exchange Ratio for each class of Company
Capital Stock  (the "COMPANY EXCHANGE RATIO") shall be equal to the quotient
of: (A) the  Parent Stock Amount; divided by (B) the aggregate number of
shares of  Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Closing
Date,  computed on a fully-diluted basis (including for these purposes the 
number of: (i) shares of Company Common Stock issued upon conversion of  the
Company Preferred Stock; and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock  issuable
pursuant to the Company Stock Rights (whether or not vested))  (such
denominator being, as of the date hereof, a total of 56,688,946).   (ii) If
the Series A Election Notice is timely received and  specifies that the
holder will treat the Merger as a liquidation in  accordance with Section

(including for  these purposes the number of (i) shares of Company Common
Stock  issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock and the 
Series C Preferred Stock; and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock  issuable
pursuant to Company Stock Rights (whether or not vested),  but expressly
excluding any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or  Company Common Stock
issued or issuable upon conversion of the  Series A Preferred Stock).   (d)
Each Share of Company Capital Stock held in the Company\'s treasury or held
by any subsidiary of the Company, immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled without the payment of any consideration therefor (it being
understood that the shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Company\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan shall not be deemed treasury shares
and shall be exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger in

contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a
Dissenting Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) shall not be converted as
described in Section 3.1 hereof, but instead shall be converted into the

Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if a Dissenting Stockholder
shall fail to perfect his demand, withdraw his demand or otherwise lose his
right for appraisal under the terms of the DGCL, then the Company Capital
Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder (the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall be
deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.1 hereof. Except as required by applicable Law, the
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, settle, or
offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. All amounts paid to
Dissenting Stockholders shall be paid without interest thereon (to the extent
permitted by applicable law). For purposes hereof, the term "DISSENTING
STOCKHOLDER" shall mean a stockholder of the Company      6  8  who

law.   Section 3.4 Stock Transfer Books. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with this Article
III shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
shares of Company Capital Stock represented thereby. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of
Company Capital Stock shall be made thereafter. If after the Effective Time,
certificates for Company Capital Stock (a "CERTIFICATE") are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
such consideration as set forth in Section 3.1 hereof, subject to applicable
law in the case of Dissenting Stockholders.   Section 3.5 Exchange
Procedure.   (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall issue an aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the
total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
3.1 hereto (such shares, subject to adjustment for fractional shares as set
forth in Exhibit F, the "ESCROW SHARES") to be held in escrow pursuant to
Article XI and Exhibit F hereof. The portion of the Escrow Shares issued and
contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock shall be in
proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock which
such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Article 3 by virtue
of ownership of Company Capital Stock; provided that, no fractional shares
shall be escrowed and the number of Escrow Shares issued and contributed on
behalf of each holder of Company Stock shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole number of shares in the manner set forth in Exhibit F.   (b) As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected and appointed by Parent, which exchange agent
shall be a reputable institution reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the
"EXCHANGE AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital Stock,
(i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (other than
fractional shares and other than the Escrow Shares) issuable in accordance
with Section 3.1 hereof, and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares to be
paid pursuant to Section 3.1, in each case in exchange for the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.   (c) Promptly after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of (A)
the      7  9  Certificates and (B) such other certifications,
affidavits or documents as Parent may request, in form acceptable to Parent
and its counsel and duly executed by such holder, said letter of transmittal
to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock
(other than fractional shares), and cash in lieu of fractional shares. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with the other required documentation and such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
subject to the provisions of Article XI hereof, (x) certificates representing
the number of whole shares of the Parent Common Stock and (y) a check
representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, after giving effect to any
required withholding tax; and, the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, certificates representing the proper number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for the cash to be
paid in lieu of fractional shares, may be issued or paid to such a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Company Capital Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   (d) Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions on
the Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid with respect to any shares of Company Capital Stock represented by a
Certificate, nor shall any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid
with respect to such shares, until such Certificate is surrendered for
exchange as provided herein. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes
which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of the Parent Common
Stock, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required
thereon.   (e) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued pursuant hereto. In lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, cash adjustments will be paid to
holders in respect of any       8  10  fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable, and the amount of such cash
adjustment shall be equal to the product of such fractional amount and the
Average Stock Price.   (f) Any portion of the Parent Common Stock held by
the Exchange Agent (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 3.5 shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and any dividends and other distributions on the Parent Common Stock,
if any, in each case, without any interest thereon.   (g) None of Parent,
Acquisition, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any such amounts remaining unclaimed by any holder
of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to such time when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity
(as hereinafter defined), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable laws,
become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims, or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.   (h) In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the execution of an indemnity agreement
reasonably acceptable to Parent by such person against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent or
Parent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the shares of Parent Common Stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares, and
any unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (i) Each of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Parent Common
Stock, and cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof (and any dividends or
distributions thereon), otherwise payable hereunder to any person, such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign
income tax law. To the extent that the Surviving Corporation or Parent so
withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.   (j) Subject to
applicable law, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any person
constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c)
under     9  11  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
promulgated thereunder (the "SECURITIES ACT"), shall not be exchanged until
Parent has received from such person a signed Rule 145 Letter, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which such person will agree to
comply with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act.   Section
3.6 Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A)
and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Section 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Income Tax Regulations.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS

is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and
is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or held under
lease or the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary,

subsidiaries taken as a whole, as applicable; provided, however, that (i) any
adverse change resulting from conditions affecting the United States economy
that is material to the business of a party hereto, shall not be taken into
account in determining whether there has been or      10  12  would be
a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with respect to such party, (ii)
any adverse change that is primarily caused by conditions affecting a
party\'s industry sector shall not be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or would be a "Material Adverse Effect" on or with
respect to such party, (iii) any adverse change in the stock price or trading
volume of a party\'s capital stock shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would be a "Material Adverse Effect" on
or with respect to such party, (iv) any failure by any party to meet the
revenue or earnings predictions of equity analysts or any other revenue or
earnings predictions or expectations (whether internal or external), for any
period ending for which earnings are released on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in and of itself, shall not be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or would be a "Material
Adverse Effect" on or with respect to such party, and (v) any adverse change
arising primarily out of, or resulting primarily from, actions taken by any
party in connection with (but not in breach of) this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder, or which is primarily attributable to
the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, any litigation, employee attrition or any
loss or postponement of business resulting from termination or modification
of any vendor, customer or other business relationships, delay of customer
order or otherwise and any corresponding change in the margins, profitability
or financial condition of a party) shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or would be a "Material Adverse Effect" on
or with respect to such party.   Section 4.2 Authority. The Company has full
power and authority (including full corporate power and authority) to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery hereof and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Company have been duly and validly
authorized and approved by the Company\'s board of directors and by the
stockholders of the Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company, and assuming the due authorization, execution and

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors\'
rights and to general principles of equity, including principles
of commercial reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.   Section 4.3

or other rights presently outstanding that would obligate the Company to

enter into any such option, warrant, call, convertible note, agreement,
commitment or other right. In addition to the foregoing, as of the date

Opinion is so delivered by such date and is in all respects satisfactory to
the Company, Parent and their respective professional advisors, then in such
event:    35  37   (a) By not later than ninety (90) days after Parent
has completed an offering of Parent Common Stock or debt or securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock (but in no event later than March 31,
2001), Parent shall:   (i) Prepare and file a registration statement with
the  Commission on Form S-3 under the Securities Act (or in the event that
the  Company is ineligible to use such form, such other form as the Company
is  eligible to use under the Securities Act) ("REGISTRATION STATEMENT") 
covering the resale of the Parent Common Stock including all Escrow  Shares
(the "REGISTRABLE SECURITIES"), issued to holders of Company  Capital Stock
as of the Effective Time who receive shares of Parent  Common Stock in
connection with the Merger, or their successors or  assigns in accordance
with Section 6.1(n) (the "HOLDERS"), which  Registration Statement (including
any amendments or supplements thereto  and prospectuses contained therein)
shall not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to  be stated therein, or necessary to make the
statements therein not  misleading. Such Registration Statement shall, in
addition and without  limitation, register (pursuant to Rule 416 under the
Securities Act, or  otherwise) such additional indeterminate number of
Registrable Securities  as shall be necessary to prevent dilution resulting
from stock splits,  stock dividends or similar transactions. Thereafter, the
Company shall  use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration
Statement and  other filings to be declared effective as soon as practicable.
Parent  shall not be obligated to include in such Registration Statement
any  shares of Parent Common Stock of the Holders other than shares issued 
pursuant to this Agreement.   (ii) Prepare and file with the Commission such
amendments and  supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus
used in  connection with such Registration Statement as may be necessary to
keep  the Registration Statement effective and to comply with the provisions
of  the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities 
covered by such Registration Statement as set forth in the Registration 
Statement and then on a continuous basis in accordance with Rule 415  under
the Securities Act; and, notify the Holders of the effectiveness of  such
Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.   (iii)
Furnish to each Holder such numbers of copies of a current  prospectus
conforming with the requirements of the Securities Act, copies  of the
Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement thereto and  any
documents incorporated by reference therein and such other documents  as such
Holder may reasonably require in order to facilitate the  disposition of
Registrable Securities owned by such Holder.    36  38   (iv) (A)
Register and qualify, or obtain an appropriate  exemption from registration
or qualification for, the securities covered  by such Registration Statement
under such other securities or "Blue Sky"  laws of each jurisdiction of the
United States as the Holders may  reasonably request, (B) prepare and file in
those jurisdictions such  supplements (including post-effective amendments)
and supplements to such  registrations and qualifications as may be necessary
to maintain the  effectiveness thereof, (C) take such other actions as may be
necessary to  maintain such registrations and qualifications in effect at all
times,  and (D) take all other actions reasonably necessary or advisable to 
qualify the Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions;  provided
that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith  or as a
condition thereto to qualify to do business as a foreign  corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified, or to  file a general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction with  respect to matters unrelated
to the issuance of Parent Company Stock  pursuant hereto.   (v) Promptly
notify each Holder in writing of the happening of  any such event as a result
of which the prospectus (including any  supplements thereto or thereof)
included in such Registration Statement,  as then in effect, includes an
untrue statement of material fact or omits  to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to  make the statements therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances  then existing, and use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly update  and/or correct such prospectus to
correct such untrue statement or  omission, and deliver such number of copies
of such supplement or  amendment to each Holder as such Holder may reasonably
request.   (vi) Promptly notify each Holder of the issuance by the 
Commission or any state securities commission or agency of any stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the  initiation
of any proceedings for that purpose. Parent shall take all  reasonable
actions necessary to prevent the issuance of any stop order  and, if any stop
order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the  earliest possible
time.   (vii) Permit a single firm of counsel, designated as Holders\' 
counsel by a majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities included  in
the Registration Statement, and reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to  review
(A) the Registration Statement and (B) all amendments and  supplements
thereto relating to information concerning the Holders within  a reasonable
period of time prior to filing thereof, to the extent  practicable.  
(viii) List the Registrable Securities covered by such  Registration
Statement with all securities exchange(s) and/or markets on  which the Parent
Common Stock is then listed and prepare and file any  required filings with
the    37  39   National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or any
exchange or  market where the shares of Parent Common Stock are traded.  
(ix) If applicable, take all steps necessary to enable Holders  to avail
themselves of the prospectus delivery mechanism set forth in  Rule 153 (or
successor thereto) under the Securities Act.   (x) Provide a CUSIP number
and a transfer agent and registrar,  which may be a single entity, for the
Registrable Securities not later  than the effective date of the Registration
Statement.   (xi) At the reasonable request of the Holders of a  majority-
in-interest of the Registrable Securities, prepare and file with  the SEC
such amendments (including post-effective amendments) and  supplements to the
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in  connection with the
Registration Statement as may be necessary in order  to change the plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration  Statement.   (xii) Furnish to
the Holders a "10b-5 negative assurances letter"  and independent auditor\'s
comfort letter, both similar to such as would  be provided in an underwritten
offering.   (xiii) In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter 
into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in  usual
and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such  offering.   (b)
Upon written notice to the Holders, Parent may suspend the use of any
prospectus used in connection with the Registration Statement if the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in good faith based upon advice of
counsel that the use of the prospectus would be misleading because of
material non-public information known to Parent and disclosure of which is
determined by the Board of Directors to be materially detrimental to Parent
and is not otherwise required by law; provided, however, that Parent may
utilize this provision only once in any twelve (12) month period and any such
suspension shall not exceed forty-five (45) calendar days. Parent will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause any such suspension to terminate at the
earliest possible date.   (c) Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by it
in complying with its obligations under this Section 6.1, including all
registration and filing fees, exchange listing fees, the fees and expenses of
counsel for Parent, the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel retained
by the Holders, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and
the fees and expenses of accountants for Parent, but excluding any brokerage
fees, selling commissions or underwriting discounts incurred by the Holders
in connection with sales under the Registration Statement.     38 
40   (d) Parent shall seek to continue to qualify for registration on
Form S-3 or any comparable or successor form or forms, or in the event that
the Company is ineligible to use form, such form as the Company is eligible
to use under the Securities Act.   (e) In the case of the registration
effected by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.1, Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to keep such registration effective until all the
Holders have completed the sales or distribution described in the
Registration Statement relating thereto or, if earlier, until such
Registrable Securities may be sold under Rule 144(k) (provided that Parent\'s
transfer agent has accepted an instruction from Parent to such effect).  
(f) Parent will indemnify each Holder, each of its directors, officers and
partners, and each person controlling each Holder within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any registration
statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document incident to any
registration, qualification or compliance effected by Parent pursuant to this
Section 6.1, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or any violation by Parent of the
Securities Act or any state securities law or in either case, any rule or
regulation thereunder applicable to Parent and relating to action or inaction
required of Parent in connection with any such registration, qualification or
compliance, and will reimburse each Holder, each of its officers, directors
and partners, and each person controlling such Holder, for any legal and any
other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating and
defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, provided that
Parent will not be liable in any such case to a Holder to the extent that any
such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based on
any untrue statement or omission based upon written information furnished to
Parent by or on behalf of such Holder therefor and stated to be specifically
for use therein. The indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.1(f)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the
consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).   (g)
Each Holder will indemnify Parent, each of its directors, officers and
partners, each person who controls Parent within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each
other Holder, and each of their directors, officers and partners, and each
person controlling such other Holder(s), against all claims, losses, damages
and liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arising out of or based on
any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular
or other document, or any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a
material fact     39  41  required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statement therein not misleading, and will reimburse Parent and such
other Holder(s) and their directors, officers and partners, or control
persons for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
with investigating and defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
action, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is
made in such registration statement, prospectus, offering circular or other
document in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to Parent by such Holder and stated to be specifically for use
therein; provided, however, that the obligations of each of the Holders
hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds to such
Holder of securities sold pursuant to the Registration Statement. The
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 6.1(g) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such claims, losses, damages or liabilities
if such settlement is effected without the consent of such Holder (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).   (h) Each party entitled to
indemnification under this Section 6.1 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give
notice to the party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any
claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying
Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting
therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall
conduct the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom,
shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall
not unreasonably be withheld) and the Indemnified Party may participate in
such defense at the Indemnified Party\'s expense (unless the Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in such
action, in which case the fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party), and provided further that the failure of
any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 6.1 unless, and only
to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.
No Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding
itself or the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the
defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.   (i) If the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.1 is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect
to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense referred to herein, then the
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a
result of such loss, liability, claim,     40  42  damage or expense in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the Indemnified Party on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the
Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue (or alleged untrue) statement of a material fact
or the omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party
and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.   (j)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on
indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting
agreement entered into in connection with any underwritten public offering
contemplated by this Agreement are in conflict with the foregoing provisions,
the provisions in such underwriting agreement shall be controlling.   (k)
With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations
of the SEC which may permit the sale of restricted securities to the public
without registration, Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
make and keep public information available as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or any successor rule, at
all times after the date hereof, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to file
with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of
Parent under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at any time, and (iii)
so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to the Holder
upon request, a written statement by Parent as to its compliance with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144, and of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Parent,
and such other reports and documents so filed as the Holder may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing the
Holder to sell any such securities without registration.   (l) Each Holder
shall notify Parent in writing promptly after, and in no event later than
five (5) business days after, the sale or other disposition by the Holder of
any of the Registrable Securities.   (m) Parent shall not include any
securities in the Registration Statement other than securities owned by the
Holders.   (n) Any Holder may assign its registration rights under this
Section 6.1 in connection with a transfer of the Registrable Securities,
prior to the date of the initial filing of the Registration Statement with
the Commission, to an affiliate of such Holder or a child, spouse or other
member of such Holder\'s immediate family or a trust for the benefit of any
such person, provided each such transferee agrees in a written instrument
delivered to Parent to be bound by this Section 6.1; provided, however, that
any Holder who owns in excess of 50,000 shares of the Registrable Securities
may     41  43  assign its registration rights under this Section 6.1
at any time in connection with a private resale of the Registrable Securities
or in connection with a transfer of the Registrable Securities to an
affiliate of such Holder or a child, spouse or other member of such Holder\'s
immediate family or a trust for the benefit of any such person, provided each
such transferee agrees in a written instrument delivered to Parent to be
bound by this Section 6.1.   (o) Parent agrees not to file any registration
statement (other than a registration statement related to a public offering
by Parent of its securities or a registration statement in connection with an
offering by Parent pursuant to Rule 144(A) under the Securities Act) prior to
the effective date of the Registration Statement.   (p) If the Registration
Statement is not declared effective on or before June 1, 2001, Parent agrees
to assume and be bound by the terms and provisions of that certain
Registration Rights Agreement dated September 30, 1998 by and among the
Company and the other parties identified therein, as amended by Amendment No.
1 dated August 27, 1999.   Section 6.2 Registration Statement on Form S-4.
If the Dilworth Securities Opinion for any reason is not delivered to Parent
within ten (10) days after the date hereof, or if the Dilworth Securities
Opinion is not in all respects satisfactory to the Company, Parent and their
respective professional advisors, then in such event:   (a) Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to prepare and cause to be filed on or before October
31, 2000 with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-4 with
respect to the issuance of parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "Form
S-4"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Form S-4 to comply with applicable law and the rules
and regulations promulgated by the Commission, to respond promptly to any
comments of the Commission or its staff and to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is
filed with the Commission. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly furnish
to the other party all information concerning itself, its stockholders and
its affiliates that may be required or reasonably requested in connection
with any action contemplated by this Section 6.2. If any event relating to
Parent or the Company occurs, or if Parent or the Company becomes aware of
any information, that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4, Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall inform the other
thereof and shall cooperate with each other in filing such amendment or
supplement with the Commission, and if appropriate, in mailing such amendment
or supplement to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. Each party will
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the
Commission or its staff or any other government officials and of any request
by the Commission or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or for additional information and
will supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between Parent,
the Company or any of their      42  44  representatives, on the one
hand, and the Commission, or its staff or any other government officials, on
the other hand, with respect to the Form S-4 or the Merger. Each party shall
cooperate as requested by the other party in connection with responding to
any such comments or requests.   In addition, Parent shall file a Form S-3
if required in order to permit the resale of the Registrable Securities by a
Holder which is an affiliate of Parent.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory or other
approvals needed to ensure that the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger: (i) will be registered or qualified under the securities law of every
jurisdiction of the United States in which any registered holder of the
Company Capital Stock who is receiving shares of registered Parent Common
Stock has an address of record or be exempt from such registration and (ii)
will be approved for quotation at the Effective Time on the Nasdaq subject to
official notice of issuance; provided, however, that Parent shall not,
pursuant to the foregoing, be required (A) to qualify to do business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified or
(B) to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction with
respect to matters unrelated to the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant
hereto.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company (in respect of the
information respectively supplied by it) agrees that (i) none of the
information to be supplied by it or its affiliates for inclusion in the Form
S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the Securities Act
and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading: and (ii) as to matters respecting it,
the Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respect with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission thereunder, except that
no covenant, representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect
to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein and no
covenant, representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.   Section 6.3 Notice to Company Stockholders of the Merger. As soon
as may be reasonably practicable, but not later than five (5) days after the
date hereof, the Company shall notify each of the stockholders of the Company
who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the Merger and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of capital stock of the
Company held by such stockholders, in accordance with the provisions of (a)
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, and (b) Section 228(d) of the DGCL. The
Company shall permit counsel for Parent to review such      43 
45  notice within a reasonable period of time prior to the date of the
making of such notification. In connection with such notification, Parent
shall provide to the Company and its counsel such SEC Documents and
information concerning Parent, for inclusion in the notification, as the
Company and its counsel may reasonably request.   Section 6.4 Cooperation;
Access to Information; Consents..   (a) Upon reasonable prior notice, the
Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time to all of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by
applicable law) as Parent may reasonably request and all its key employees.
Upon reasonable prior notice, Parent shall afford the Company and
its accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of
its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel (subject to
restrictions imposed by applicable law) as the Company may reasonably request
and all its key employees. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.   (b) The Company
and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the consents,
waivers, assignments and approvals under any of their respective material
contracts as may be required in connection with the Merger so as to preserve
all rights of, and benefits to, the Company and Parent thereunder.  
Section 6.5 Expenses. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, including,
without limitation, all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and
all other fees and expenses of third parties ("THIRD PARTY EXPENSES")
incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees
and expenses, it being understood that the fees and expenses associated with
printing and distributing the materials under Section 6.2 are the obligations
of the Parent.   Section 6.6 Public Disclosures. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by law, the NASDAQ or any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange. The parties have agreed to the text of the
joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.     44 
46   Section 6.7 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions provided in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents, tax opinions and approvals and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments
or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to cause the Merger to be effective
on or before October 31, 2000 or as soon as practicable thereafter and
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) none of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be required
to agree to any divestiture or hold separate or similar transactions by it or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property of any of them or any of their subsidiaries or
affiliates, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of
any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such
assets, properties and stock and (B) the Company shall not, without Parent\'s
prior written consent, commit to any divestiture or hold separate or similar
transaction by it or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of
capital stock or of any business, assets or property of any of them or any of
their subsidiaries or affiliates, or the imposition of any
material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses
or to on or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.  
Section 6.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the other party of (i) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is
likely to cause any representation or warranty of any party contained in this
Agreement to be untrue and inaccurate at or prior to the Effective Time such
that the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(b) or 7.3(b) would not be
satisfied and (ii) any failure of Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder which is likely to cause any condition set
in Article VII hereof not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice
and no disclosure by Parent or the Company, pursuant to this Section 6.8
shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Parent Disclosure Letter or the
Company Disclosure Letter, respectively, or prevent or cure any
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant, unless the
recipient party shall agree in writing to accept the disclosures set forth in
any such notice.   Section 6.9 Support Agreements; Share Transfer

herein as required by the H-S-R Act, as well as comparable pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws and
regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties.
Parent and the Company each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any
information which may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b)

at the request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 6.12 Company
Stock Rights.   (a) Each Company Stock Right which is vested prior to or as
of the Closing may be exercised by the holder thereof as and if so vested at
any time prior to or at Closing, and shares of Company Common Stock shall be
issued to such holder upon such exercise in accordance with the terms of such
Company Stock Right, provided that such holder pays to the Company the
applicable exercise price or warrant purchase price and otherwise complies
with all conditions to and procedures for the exercise of such options,
warrants or rights.   (b) Each Company Stock Right which (i) is not vested
prior to or as of the Closing or (ii) otherwise is not exercised by the
holder thereof prior to or at the Closing, shall without further action on
the part of the holder thereof be converted into an option to acquire a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
(applicable to the conversion of Company Common Stock, as determined in
accordance with Section 3.1(c)(i) or 3.1(c)(ii)(B), as applicable, hereof),
rounded up to the nearest whole share (except where such rounding would
adversely affect the status of an option to acquire Company Common Stock as
an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code), and at a per share
option price equal to the per share option price, if any, under the related
Company Stock Right divided by the Exchange Ratio (applicable to
the conversion of Company Common Stock, as determined in accordance with
Section 3.1(c)(i) or 3.1(c)(ii)(B), as applicable, hereof),     46 
48  on terms and conditions substantially identical to the terms and
conditions existing under the related Company Stock Right so converted.  
(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the options assumed in accordance with this Section 6.12.
Not later than ten (10) days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the
Securities Act with respect to all shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
options that may be registered on a Form S-8, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement for
so long as such options remain outstanding.   Section 6.13 Employee
Benefits. From the Effective Time and until December 31, 2000, Parent shall
cause the Company to continue (a) to maintain employee benefits plans and
benefit arrangements for the benefit of the Company\'s employees which are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the Employee Plans and Benefit
