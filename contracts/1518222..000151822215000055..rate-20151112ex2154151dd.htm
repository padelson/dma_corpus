"Deferred Payment Date"), Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to (i)
$25,000,000, minus (ii) the adjustments pursuant to Section 2.5 (the
"Deferred Payment Amount"), subject to the provisions of this Section 2.2(b).
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2(b) but
subject to Section 2.2(b)(ii), to the extent that Buyer is unable to pay the
Deferred Payment Amount in full as a result of prohibitions under the Credit
Agreement on or before the Deferred Payment Date, Buyer shall (A) pay on the
Deferred Payment Date as much of the Deferred Payment Amount as is permitted
to be paid under the Credit Agreement on the Deferred Payment Date, (B) notify
the Seller in writing on the Deferred Payment Date of such inability to pay
the applicable portion of the Deferred Payment Amount in full in a timely
manner, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed explanation of the
circumstances giving rise to such inability to pay and (C) deliver a
subordinated promissory note duly executed by Buyer in favor of Seller in the
form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Promissory Note") in a principal amount equal
to the sum of (I) the amount of the Deferred Payment Amount that has not been
paid in cash on or before the Deferred Payment Date, plus (II) interest on
such unpaid portion of the Deferred Payment Amount accruing at 8% per annum
compounding annually from the Closing Date through the Deferred  \t\t

Payment Date. Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to pay (A) the Deferred
Payment Amount in full on the Deferred Payment Date to the fullest extent
permitted under the terms of the Credit Agreement, and (B) if applicable, all
outstanding principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest on the
Promissory Note to the fullest extent Buyer is permitted to make such payment
or any portion thereof from time to time under the terms of the Credit
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
period that any portion of the Deferred Payment Amount and/or any obligations
under the Promissory Note, if applicable, remain unpaid, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, not (A) amend, waive or otherwise modify any
provision of the Credit Agreement or any Loan Document (as defined in the
Credit Agreement) or (B) otherwise, directly or indirectly, take any action,
in each case, which would be expected to restrict, prohibit or delay Buyer's
ability to pay the Deferred Payment Amount and/or, if applicable, any
obligations under the Promissory Note in accordance herewith; provided,
however, that this sentence shall not restrict any such amendment, waiver,
modification or the taking of such action to the extent taken for a bona fide
business purpose and not with the specific intent of restricting, prohibiting
or delaying Buyer's ability to pay the Deferred Payment Amount and/or, if
applicable, any obligations under the Promissory Note in accordance herewith.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note and the Subordination
Agreement, the entire Deferred Payment Amount and/or, if applicable, all
outstanding principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest under the
Promissory Note, shall be due and payable in full in cash within five (5)
Business Days after the occurrence of any Acceleration Event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tUnless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto intend
and agree that all payments made pursuant to this Section 2.2(b) are to be
treated by Buyer (and its Affiliates) and Seller (and its Affiliates) as
additional consideration for the Purchased Equity Interests, except to the
extent appropriately treated as interest under applicable Law, and none of the
parties hereto shall take any position on a Tax Return inconsistent with such
characterization. \t\t

Amount shall be allocated to the NetQuote Shares and IQ Holdings Interests as
set forth in Section 7.5(e). \t\t

(iii) Seller's calculation of the amount payable under Section 2.2(a) on the

applied, and using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and
procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation
methodology, as were used in the preparation of the Audited Balance Sheet and

reasonable access to the Books and Records of the Acquired Companies and shall
cause the personnel of the Acquired Companies to reasonably cooperate with
Buyer for the purpose of enabling Buyer to calculate, and to review Seller's
calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Cash and such

Maximum Cash Amount); provided, however, that in the event of a decrease, in
lieu of decreasing the amount payable under Section 2.4(b)(i), the Deferred
Payment Amount shall first be decreased by up to an aggregate of $2,000,000,
and, if applicable, thereafter the amount payable under Section 2.4(b)(i)
shall be decreased by the amount in excess of $2,000,000. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tClosing Statement. As soon as practicable, but not later than sixty
(60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare in good faith and
deliver to Seller a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth a
calculation of Net Working Capital and Cash, in each case, along with
reasonable supporting detail to evidence the calculation of such amount.
The Closing Statement and all calculations therein shall be determined as of
12:01 a.m. Eastern time on the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tReasonable Access. Upon receipt of the Closing Statement and prior to
the delivery of a Protest Notice, if any, Seller and its Representatives shall
be given reasonable access, upon prior reasonable written request, during
regular business hours, to the Books and Records of the Acquired Companies
and the work papers, trial balances and other materials relating to the
preparation of the Closing Statement and Buyer shall cause the personnel of
the Acquired Companies to reasonably cooperate with Seller for the purpose of
enabling Seller to calculate, and to review Buyer's calculation of Net Working
Capital and Cash. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tProtest Notice. Within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Closing Statement, Seller may deliver written notice (the "Protest Notice")
to Buyer of any disagreement that Seller may have as to the Closing Statement
setting forth in reasonable detail each item and amount(s) in dispute, along
with reasonable detail of the basis therefor, including reasonable supporting
documentation, schedules, and calculations enabling Buyer to calculate and
review Seller's calculation of Net Working Capital and Cash. If Seller fails
to deliver a Protest Notice on or before the date which is sixty (60) days
following delivery of the Closing Statement (or applicable later date if such
period is tolled), the Net Working Capital and Cash, as set forth on the
Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by Seller. In
addition, any item of Net Working Capital and Cash not disputed in the Protest
Notice shall be final, binding and non-appealable by Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tResolution of Protest. If a Protest Notice is timely delivered in
accordance with Section 2.5(e), Seller and Buyer shall promptly endeavor in
good faith to resolve any disagreement as to the Closing Statement. If Buyer
and Seller are unable to resolve in writing any disagreement as to the Closing
Statement within thirty (30) days following Buyer's receipt of the Protest
Notice, then the amounts set forth in the Protest Notice remaining in dispute
will be promptly referred to Ernst and Young  \t\t

LLP (or such independent accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized
national standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Seller) (the
"Accountants") for final arbitration, which arbitration shall be completed
within thirty (30) days after the matter is submitted to the Accountants, and
which arbitration shall be final, binding and non-appealable by Buyer and
Seller. The Accountants shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based solely
on presentations and submissions by Buyer and Seller (which presentations and
submissions shall be made to the Accountants no later than fifteen (15) days
after the engagement of the Accountants), and not by independent review, only
those amounts set forth in the Protest Notice still in dispute, in each case,
in accordance with the definitions of Net Working Capital and Cash set forth
herein. The Accountants' determination shall be made within thirty (30) days
of its engagement, shall be set forth in a written statement, which includes
the basis for its determination on each of the disputed items set forth in the
Protest Notice, delivered to Buyer and Seller and shall be final, binding and
conclusive. In resolving any disagreement, the Accountants shall not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party, as set forth on the Closing Statement and Protest Notice. The Closing
Statement shall be modified if necessary to reflect such determination by the
Accountant. Buyer and Seller agree to execute, if requested by the
Accountants, a reasonable engagement letter. The fees and expenses of the
Accountants shall be allocated between Buyer and Seller (as determined by the
Accountants) so that Seller's share of such fees and expenses shall be equal
to the product of (i) the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses, and (ii)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute that is ultimately
unsuccessfully disputed by Seller (as determined by the Accountant) and the
denominator of which is the total amount in dispute submitted to arbitration.
The balance of such fees and expenses shall be paid by Buyer. The parties
agree that the purpose of the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.5 with
respect to Net Working Capital and Cash is to measure the amount of changes in
Net Working Capital and Cash in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
and using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and procedures,
with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were
used in the preparation of the Audited Balance Sheet and the Example Net
Working Calculation. The term "Final Closing Statement," as used in this
Agreement, shall mean the Closing Statement if deemed final in accordance with
Section 2.5(e) or the definitive Closing Statement agreed to in writing by
Seller and Buyer or resulting from the determinations made by the Accountants
in accordance with this Section 2.5(f). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tPayment. Within five (5) days of the determination of the Final
Closing Statement: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tif the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Cash
(provided that in no event shall the Estimated Cash exceed the Maximum Cash
Amount) is greater than the sum of the Net Working Capital and Cash set forth
on the Final Closing Statement, Seller shall pay to Buyer such difference as
follows: first to the extent there was an increase under Section 2.4(b)(i),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer up to an amount equal to such increase; second, if applicable, by
decreasing the Deferred Payment Amount by up to an aggregate of $2,000,000
(including, if applicable, any decrease pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i)); and
third by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Buyer; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tif the sum of the Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Cash
(provided that in no event shall the Estimated Cash exceed the Maximum Cash
Amount) is less than the sum of the Net Working Capital and Cash set forth on
the Final Closing Statement, then Buyer shall pay to Seller such difference as
follows: first to the extent there was an decrease in the Deferred Payment
Amount under Section 2.4(b)(i), by increasing the Deferred Payment Amount by
up to an aggregate of $2,000,000 (provided, that in no event will the
Deferred Payment Amount be increased pursuant to this to more than
$25,000,000) and second by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller. \t\t

Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the process set forth in this Section 2.5 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto for any disputes related to items required to be
included or reflected in the calculation of Net Working Capital and/or
Cash. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWithholding. Notwithstanding any other provision to this Agreement
but subject to the remainder of this Section 2.6, Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and any applicable paying agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any payments under this Agreement, to any person such amounts
that Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any applicable paying agent are required
to deduct and withhold under applicable Law with respect to any such
deliveries and payments under the Code or any provision of state, local,
provincial or foreign Tax Law (including the employee portion of all payroll
Taxes); provided, however, that Buyer shall act in good faith to provide
Seller with written notice prior to Buyer deducting and withholding any amount
from consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and timely and properly paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by Buyer, the Acquired Companies and any
applicable paying agent in accordance with the foregoing, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
compensatory amounts subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable
pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be promptly payable
through the applicable payroll of the applicable Acquired Company in
accordance with applicable payroll procedures. \t\t

payable by Buyer on the Closing Date pursuant to Article II and the payment of
all costs and expenses required to be paid by Buyer at the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSeller and the Acquired Companies will be deemed to be in compliance
with this Section 5.2, and Buyer shall not allege that Seller or any Acquired
Company is or has not been in compliance with this Section 5.2, unless Buyer

which failure to comply has not been cured within five (5) Business Days from
receipt of such written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 8.1(b), as it

(ii) Buyer does not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.4(b) as a result of any breaches of this Section 5.2 by any
Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

negotiate, recommend, propose or enter into any agreement or any transaction
involving a merger, consolidation, business combination, purchase or
disposition of any assets of the Acquired Companies or any capital stock of
the Acquired Companies other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"); provided, however, that an
"Acquisition Transaction" shall exclude any such agreement or transaction
involving all or any material portion the assets of Seller (other than the
Acquired Companies) or all or any material portion of Seller's capital stock
after giving effect to the sale of the Acquired Companies pursuant to this
Agreement (provided, that (x) Seller shall provide Buyer with prompt written
notice (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) following the entry into
of any such agreement or transaction and (y) for the avoidance of doubt, any
such agreement or transaction shall not relieve Seller of its obligations
hereunder), (ii) knowingly encourage, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an

Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties or
assets of the Acquired Companies in connection with a proposal for an
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) otherwise knowingly cooperate in any way
with, or assist or participate in, or encourage, any effort or attempt by any
other Person or entity to do or seek any of the foregoing. Seller shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies and their representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any persons or entities (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAccess to Premises and Information. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VIII, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
permit Buyer, the prospective providers of the Debt Financing and their
respective Representatives to have reasonable access (at reasonable times,
during regular business hours, and upon reasonable notice) to all
Representatives of the Acquired Companies and to all premises, properties,
books, records (including Tax records), contracts, financial and operating
data and other information and documents of, or pertaining to, the Acquired
Companies or the Business, in any such case, to the extent reasonably required
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and to make copies (at its own expense) of such books, records, contracts,
data, information and documents as Buyer, the prospective providers of the
Debt Financing or their respective Representatives may reasonably request;
provided, however, that neither Seller nor any Acquired Company or any of
their Representatives are under any obligation to provide any such access,
furnish any information, or otherwise disclose to Buyer, the prospective
providers of the Debt Financing or any of  \t\t

their respective Representatives any information the disclosure of which, in
Seller's reasonable discretion upon the advice of outside legal counsel, would
reasonably be likely to contravene any Contract or applicable Law or to
compromise or otherwise jeopardize any applicable privilege (including the
attorney-client privilege); provided, further, that in the event that access
is to be denied pursuant to this proviso, Seller shall notify Buyer and Seller
and Buyer shall cooperate to implement commercially reasonable procedures
designed to both allow for such examination and avoid such loss or impairment
of privilege to the extent possible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tRegistered Intellectual Property. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing, Seller shall transfer, contribute, assign and convey or
cause to be transferred, contributed, assigned and conveyed to the Acquired
Companies, all of the right, title and interest in and to all of the
Registered Intellectual Property and any other Contracts or material assets
primarily used in the Business, to the extent not currently held by any of the
Acquired Companies, and, if applicable, shall record such transfer in the
public record, including updating Internet domain name registrations (to
reflect an Acquired Company as the "Registrant Organization" for each domain
name included in the Registered Intellectual and to have an Acquired Company
own the account from which changes to and renewals of such domain names can be
made) and the filing of assignments with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
and U.S. Copyright Office to reflect any Acquired Company as the record owner
of each such item). In the event that, at any time on or within two (2) years
after the Closing, Seller becomes aware that it has received or continues to
possess any Registered Intellectual Property, Contracts or other material
assets primarily used in the Business, Seller shall notify Buyer and promptly
transfer, contribute, assign or convey, or cause to be transferred,
contributed, assigned or conveyed such Registered Intellectual Property,
Contracts or other assets to Buyer (or any Acquired Company or Person
designated by Buyer) (the "Transferee") and such Transferee shall accept, or
cause to be accepted, such Registered Intellectual Property, Contracts or
other assets. Prior to any transfer required by this Section 5.5, the Seller
shall hold such Registered Intellectual Property, Contracts or other assets
primarily used in the Business in trust for the benefit of Buyer.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the remedies
contemplated by Section 10.12(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for
any breach of this Section 5.5. \t\t

behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
(b) will have or be subject to any liability or obligation to Buyer or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' use of, any such information,
including the Confidential Information Memorandum prepared by Merrill Lynch,

made available to Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their Representatives in

behalf of the Acquired Companies certain projections, including projected

Affiliates are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have no claim against Seller, the Acquired Companies, any of
their Affiliates or any Representatives of any of the foregoing with respect
thereto, other than to the extent any such information or materials described
in this sentence are the subject of a representation or a warranty expressly
set forth in Article III, or in any certificates delivered hereunder (and then
only to the extent of such representation or warranty). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.2, elsewhere in this
Agreement (including Section 8.5, Article IX and Section 10.16) or otherwise,
Buyer retains all of its rights and remedies with respect to claims based on
fraud committed by or on behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEfforts to Obtain Financing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause
to be done, all things reasonably necessary to obtain the Equity Financing at
the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter, including to: (i) maintain the Equity Commitment Letter in effect,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto,
(iii) comply with and perform the obligations applicable to it pursuant to
such Equity Commitment Letter, (iv) subject to Section 10.12(b), draw down on
and consummate the Equity Financing, including enforce its rights under the
Equity Commitment Letter and cause the Sponsor to fund the Equity Financing at

all conditions applicable to it in such definitive agreements that are within
its control. \t\t

 \t\t

to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to

in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) comply with and maintain the Debt Commitment Letter in
effect, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto, (iii) comply with and perform the obligations applicable to it
pursuant to such Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) draw down on and consummate the
Debt Financing if the conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing
have been satisfied or waived, and (v) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to it in such definitive agreements that are within its
control. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf at any time it becomes likely (as determined in the reasonable

Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or if any portion of
the Debt Financing expires or terminates or otherwise becomes unavailable,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for, and obtain as

contemplated hereby and perform all of its obligations hereunder and, for the
purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Debt Financing shall be
deemed to include such Alternative Financing, all references to the Debt
Commitment Letter shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing and all references to the Lenders shall include the Persons
providing or arranging the Alternative Financing; provided, that Buyer shall
be under no obligation to obtain alternative financing on terms which are in
the aggregate less favorable to Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Sponsor) than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer), it being understood that if Buyer enters into a
commitment letter with respect to any Alternative Financing, Buyer shall be
subject to the same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as
set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall not replace, amend or waive any Commitment Letter or any
provision thereof without Seller's prior written consent if such replacement,
amendment or waiver would, or would reasonably be expected to, when taken
together with all such amendments, modifications waivers and replacements:
(i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to
occur, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated at the Closing,
(iv) reduce (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing)
the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) (unless such
amount is replaced with any amount of new committed equity financing or one or
more replacement debt facilities, or (v) impose new conditions precedent or
adversely expand, amend or modify any of the existing conditions precedent to
the receipt of the Financing. Upon any permitted amendment, supplement,
modification or replacement of any Commitment Letter (including with respect
to any Alternative Financing) in accordance with this Section 6.3, the term
"Commitment Letters" shall mean the Commitment Letters as so amended,
supplemented, modified or replaced, and references to "Financing", "Equity
Financing", "Debt Financing" and/or "Alternative Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as so amended, supplemented,
modified or replaced. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all the
conditions to the Closing set forth in this Agreement (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction thereof), and the completion of the Marketing Period, Buyer shall
draw down on the Debt Financing referred to in the Debt Commitment Letter when
the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter are satisfied. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall provide Seller prompt (but in any event, within three (3)
Business Days) notice (i) upon becoming aware of any material breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any material breach, default, repudiation, cancellation or
termination) by any party of any Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements relating to the Financing or any termination of any Commitment
Letter or such definitive agreements relating to the Financing, (ii) upon
receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any written
notice or other written communication of any such material breach, default,
repudiation, cancellation or termination, (iii) upon becoming aware of any
dispute or disagreement between or among the parties to any of the Commitment
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing with respect to
the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at the Closing, and (iv) if for any reason Buyer believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letters or the definitive documents related to the Financing in any manner
which impairs, delays or prevents the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within three (3) Business Days, after the date Seller delivers Buyer a
written request,  \t\t

Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by Seller relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence. In addition, Buyer shall, upon reasonable request of

detail of the status of its efforts to finalize the Financing and provide to

 \t\t\tBuyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Acquired Companies
and their respective Representatives and Affiliates from and against all
Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the obligations
under Section 5.2, except for any of the foregoing to the extent the same is
the result of (a) historical information furnished in writing by or on behalf
of the Seller or the Acquired Companies, including financial statements, or
(b) the willful misconduct, fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed
by or on behalf of Seller or the Acquired Companies. Buyer shall promptly,
upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller or the Acquired Companies for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or the Acquired

employees, suppliers, equipment, designs, drawings, programs, strategies,
analyses, profit margins, sales, methods of operation, plans, products,
technologies, materials, trade secrets, strategies, prospects or other
proprietary information ("Seller Confidential Information"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller Confidential Information shall not include information
which is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result
of a breach of this Agreement by Buyer. For the five (5) year period
immediately following the Closing, Buyer will refrain from using or disclosing
any of the Seller Confidential Information except (i) in connection with
enforcing its rights, or defending any claim, under this Agreement and (ii) to
the extent reasonably required in connection with the preparation, filing or
reporting of Tax Returns, financial statements and other public disclosures
which Buyer believes in good faith are required by applicable Law or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which any of Buyer or its Affiliates
lists or trades any securities. In the event that, during such period, Buyer
is requested or required by Law, by any Governmental Entity or by
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process
to disclose any Seller Confidential Information, Buyer may disclose the Seller
Confidential Information so requested or required, provided that Buyer will
notify Seller promptly of the request or requirement so that Seller may seek
an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of
this Section 6.4. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExcluded Names. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that no
Acquired Company has any right, title or interest in any Excluded Name and no
interest in or right to use the Excluded Names is being assigned, licensed,
transferred or otherwise conveyed to Buyer or to any Acquired Company pursuant
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. After the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) will
promptly, and in any event within ninety (90) days, stop using the Excluded
Names. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies following the Closing) will register, attempt to register or assist
another in registering the Excluded Names anywhere in the world as a

or any other indication of source. \t\t

to make certain payments to Employees pursuant to the terms of the Retention

Employee's termination of employment on or prior to any such date.
Accordingly, following the Closing, Buyer shall provide prompt written notice
to Seller of any termination of the employment of any Employee who was awarded
a bonus under the Retention Plans and the circumstances of such termination to
enable Seller to determine whether payments will be due to each such Employee
under the Retention Plans. \t\t

incurred by Seller under or in connection with its obligations as a guarantor
under the Boston Lease. \t\t

Seller and Buyer shall use their respective best efforts to promptly obtain
any clearance required under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental Entity
and shall respond as promptly as practicable to any such inquiry or request.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEach of the parties hereto agrees to instruct their respective counsel
to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate and expedite the identification and resolution of any issues
arising under the HSR Act and any Other Antitrust Laws at the earliest
practicable dates. Such commercially reasonable efforts and cooperation
include counsel's undertaking (i) to promptly provide copies of written

the opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of any of the
parties, shall be limited to outside antitrust counsel only). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSupplemental Disclosure. From time to time prior to the Closing,
Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend
the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to any representation or warranty
contained in Article III solely to reflect any matter first existing or first
occurring after the date hereof that, if existing or occurring at or prior to
the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described on the
applicable Seller Disclosure Schedule or that is necessary to complete or
correct any information in any representation or warranty contained in Article
III (each a "Schedule Supplement"); provided, however, that in the event that
any such Schedule Supplement includes disclosure of events or circumstances
that would entitle Buyer to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.4(b) and Buyer does not elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.4(b) within thirty (30) days of its receipt of such Schedule
Supplement, then such Schedule Supplement shall automatically be deemed to be
incorporated into and to supplement and amend the Seller Disclosure Schedules
for all purposes hereunder, including Sections 8.1, 8.4 and 9.2, and Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived all conditions to its obligations hereunder and
rights to terminate this Agreement with respect to the matters disclosed
therein under Sections 8.1 or 8.4 or otherwise and shall have no right to
indemnification or reimbursement with respect to the matters disclosed therein
under Section 9.2 or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEfforts to Close; Further Assurances.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSubject to the terms of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied and for the Closing to occur. The "efforts" of Seller
shall not require Seller or any of its Affiliates to provide financing to
Buyer for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for
the Deferred Payment Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFrom and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either Buyer or

Preparation of Tax Returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf any Acquired Company is required to be included in any
consolidated, unitary, combined or similar Tax Return filed by Seller or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), Seller shall prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, such Tax Return and Buyer shall
cause such Acquired Company to join Seller or such Affiliate in the filing of
such Tax Return, and take any actions reasonably requested by Seller in
connection with the preparation and filing of such Tax Return to the extent in
accordance with applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSeller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Income Tax Returns
for the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period") with an initial due date after the
Closing Date (each, a "Pre-Closing Income Tax Return"). All Pre-Closing
Income Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with the past practice of the
Acquired Companies and shall reflect, to the extent allowed by applicable Law,
a deduction for the Transaction Tax Deductions. All Pre-Closing Income Tax
Returns shall reflect carrybacks of net operating losses, to which Seller
shall be entitled, to the maximum extent allowed by Law. At least thirty (30)
days prior to the date on which any Pre-Closing Income Tax Return is required
to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions), Seller shall submit
such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return to Buyer for Buyer's review. Buyer shall
provide written notice to Seller of its disagreement with any items in such
Pre-Closing Income Tax Return within ten (10) days of its receipt of such Pre-
Closing Income Tax Return, and if Buyer fails to provide such notice, such
Pre-Closing Income Tax Return shall become final and binding upon the parties
hereto, and Buyer shall timely and properly file such Pre-Closing Income Tax
Return as prepared by Seller. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any
dispute regarding any Pre-Closing Income Tax Return within five (5) days after
Buyer delivers such notice of disagreement, then the dispute will be finally
and conclusively resolved by the Accountants in accordance with the dispute
resolution procedure set forth in Section 2.5(f). The Accountants shall
resolve any dispute in favor of Seller if Seller's position is supported by
the "more likely than not" standard under the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Income Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for all Tax periods
that begin on or before and end after the Closing Date (each such Tax period,
a "Straddle Period" and each such Tax Return, a "Straddle Period Income Tax
Return"). All Straddle Period Income Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent
with the past practice of the Acquired Companies. At least thirty (30) days
prior to the date on which any Straddle Period Income Tax Return is required
to be filed (taking into account any valid extensions), Buyer shall submit
such Straddle Income Period Tax Return and a pro forma Income Tax Return for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (a "Pro Forma
Return"), to Seller for Seller's review. Seller shall provide written notice
to Buyer of its disagreement with any items in such Straddle Period Income Tax
Return or related Pro Forma Return within ten (10) days of its receipt of such
Straddle Period Income Tax Return or related Pro Forma Return, and if Seller
fails to provide such notice, such Straddle Period Income Tax Return, and any
related Pro Forma Return, shall become final and binding upon the parties
hereto, and Buyer shall timely and properly file such Straddle Period Income
Tax Return. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any dispute regarding
any Straddle Period Income Tax Return or related Pro Forma Return within five
(5) days after Seller delivers such notice of disagreement, then the dispute
will be finally and conclusively resolved by the Accountants in accordance
with the dispute resolution procedure set forth in Section 2.5(e). The
Accountants shall resolve any dispute in favor of Seller if Seller's position
is supported by the "more likely than not" standard under the Code. Seller
shall pay to Buyer the Seller's portion, determined in accordance with Section
7.5(b), of any Income Taxes reflected as due on any Straddle Period Income Tax
Return (as finally prepared pursuant to this Section 7.5(a)(iii)) not later
than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle Period
Income Tax Return. \t\t

Allocation of Straddle Period Tax Liability. For all purposes under this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the preparation of any Pro
Forma Return), in the case of any Straddle Period, the portion of Taxes (or
any Tax refund or amount credited against any Tax) that are allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of the Closing Date will be:
(i) in the case of property Taxes and other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
without regard to income, payroll, gross receipts or sales or use, deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes (or Tax refund or amount credited against Tax) for
the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending at
the end of the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Acquired Companies
terminated at the end of the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTax Refunds. Any cash Tax refunds that are actually received (or, in
the case of a Straddle Period, that would have been received if the Straddle
Period ended on the Closing Date) by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired
Companies), and any amounts actually credited against any cash Taxes due and
payable to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the
Closing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired Companies) become entitled,
that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) except to the extent that (i) such refund
or credit was reflected as a current asset in the determination of the Net
Working Capital on the Final Closing Statement, or (ii) such refund or credit
is attributable to the carryback of a Tax attribute (including a net operating
loss, net capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development credit)
arising in a period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be for the
account of Seller, and Buyer shall pay over to Seller, as additional purchase
price for the Purchased Equity Interests, any such refund or the amount of any
such credit within five (5) days after actual receipt or actually receiving
credit with respect thereto (or, in the case of any deemed refund or credit
for a Straddle Period, within five (5) days after the Tax Return for such
Straddle Period is due to be filed). Upon Seller's request, Buyer shall file
(or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns) or
other documents claiming any refunds, including through the carryback of any
net operating losses that are attributable to a Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date, to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence. Any refund or credit of Taxes with respect to the
Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing and post-Closing
Tax Periods in accordance with Section 7.5(b). Other than any Tax refund or
credit the benefit of which is payable to Seller pursuant to this Section
7.5(d), Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall receive the benefits of all
Tax refunds or credits received by the Acquired Companies after the Closing
Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTransaction Tax Deductions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
any Transaction Tax Deduction shall be reflected in the Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies in Tax periods or portions of Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, in each case to the extent allowed by applicable
Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAgreed Tax Treatment. Buyer shall be a "C corporation" for purposes
of the Code. Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company eligible to do so to (i)
join Buyer's "consolidated group" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-1(h)) effective as of the beginning of the date following the
Closing Date and (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, treat the
Closing Date as the last date of a Tax period of such Acquired Companies, and
Seller and Buyer agree that cause the sale and purchase of the IQ Holdings
Interests to be treated (A) as the sale of all of the assets of IQ Holdings by
Seller and (B) as the purchase of all of the assets of IQ Holdings by Buyer
(collectively, the "Agreed Tax Treatment"). Each party hereto shall file all
Tax Returns consistently with the Agreed Tax Treatment and the Allocation and
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith, unless an IRS audit
concludes otherwise and the time permitted to challenge the outcome of such
audit has lapsed. \t\t

Allocation of Purchase Price. The Closing Payment Amount and the Deferred
Payment Amount (and any other item of consideration for purposes of Section
1060 of the Code (together, the "Consideration") and any adjustment thereto
will be allocated for tax purposes 43.1% to the NetQuote Shares and 56.9% to
the IQ Holdings Interests; provided, however, that any consideration
consisting of any liabilities of IQ Holdings shall be allocated to IQ
Holdings. The Consideration allocated to the IQ Holdings Interests shall be
further allocated among the assets of IQ Holdings for Tax purposes (including
for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code) in accordance methodologies set
forth on Schedule 7.5(f). No later than sixty (60) days following the
determination of the Final Closing Statement, Buyer shall prepare and provide
to Seller for Seller's review and comment an allocation of the Consideration
(the "Allocation"). In the case of any dispute regarding an Allocation
prepared by Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.5(f), such dispute shall be
resolved by the Accountants (which shall determine whether the Allocation was
prepared in accordance with this Section 7.5(f)) in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.5(f). In case any subsequent adjustment to
the Consideration requires an amendment to the Allocation, Buyer shall prepare
such amendment in accordance with this Section 7.5(f) and, subject to Seller's
review and comment and any dispute resolution such amended allocation shall
become the Allocation for purposes of this Agreement. Each party hereto shall
file all Tax Returns consistently with the Agreed Tax Treatment and the
Allocation and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing for the avoidance of doubt, the Acquired
Companies) to, (i) except pursuant to Section 7.5(a) or upon Seller's written
request pursuant to Section 7.5(c), file, re-file, supplement or amend any Tax
Return of any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) initiate
any voluntary disclosure process or similar with any taxing authority
regarding any Taxes or Tax Returns of any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (iii) take any action relating to Taxes or that would actually
create a Tax liability of Seller on the Closing Date (other than as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement) that is outside the ordinary course of
business, (iv) make a Tax election for any Acquired Company with an effective
date on or before the Closing Date, (v) except with Seller's consent (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed) carryback
any net operating losses to a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, or (vi) make (or permit to be made) any election
under Section 338 of the Code (or any comparable applicable provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law) with respect to any Acquired Company.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the Seller shall be entitled to pursue (on,
before, and after the Closing Date) a process (including voluntary disclosure
to, and settlements with the relevant Governmental Entity, and/or the filing
of Tax Returns and amended Tax Returns with the relevant Governmental Entity
in connection therewith) that it in good faith believes is appropriate to
ensure that the Acquired Companies have complied with their respective Tax
Return filing and Tax payment obligations with regard to sales and use or
similar Taxes by the Acquired Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and the
portion of any Straddle Periods ending on the Closing Date (such process, the
"VDA Process"). In connection with the VDA Process, Seller shall be entitled
to submit ruling requests to any Tax jurisdictions seeking a determination
whether the Acquired Companies sales are subject to sales and use or similar
Taxes in such jurisdiction. Within a reasonable time before submitting to a
Governmental Entity any ruling request, voluntary disclosure statement or
agreement, Tax Return or amended Tax Return pursuant to the VDA Process that
shows or will result in liability for state or local sales or use or similar
Taxes attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods ("Pre-Closing VDA Process"), the
Seller shall provide the Buyer with a copy of such ruling request, voluntary
disclosure statement or agreement, settlement agreement, Tax Return or amended
Tax Return, as applicable, and Seller shall in good faith consider any
reasonable comments provided in writing by the Buyer with respect to a Pre-
Closing VDA Process. Upon the Buyer's reasonable written request, Seller
shall provide the Buyer with reasonable information regarding the status of
the Pre-Closing VDA Process. The parties hereto shall, and Buyer shall cause

to, cooperate in the VDA Process, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies, to timely and properly sign and file any ruling request,
voluntary disclosure or similar statement or agreement, Tax Return or amended
Tax Return provided to Buyer by Seller as part of the VDA Process and, upon
receipt of any payment from Seller required by the indemnification obligations
under Section 9.2(a)(iii) resulting from the VDA Process, Buyer shall promptly
make any payments required to be made in connection with the VDA Process.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEach of Buyer and Seller shall pay fifty percent (50%) all Transfer
Taxes arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNot more than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (in form reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer) stating that the Seller is not a "foreign person" and conforming to the
applicable requirements of Section 1445 of the Code, dated as of the Closing
Date (a "FIRPTA Certificate"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEach of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify Seller or Buyer (as the case may be) in writing of any written
notice of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding principally involving Taxes received by them involving the
Acquired Companies which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be
grounds for indemnification under Section 9.2; provided, however, that a
failure to give such notice will not affect the right to indemnification under
this Agreement absent actual prejudice to the indemnifying party (but in such
event only to the extent of such prejudice). In the case of such an audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding that relates solely to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period and solely to an Acquired Company, except to the extent provided
otherwise below, Seller shall have the right at its own expense to control the
conduct of such audit or proceeding so long as they conduct the defense
actively, diligently and in good faith. Buyer also may participate in any such
audit or proceeding at its own expense and, (1) if Seller does not assume or
is not conducting the defense of any such audit or proceeding actively,
diligently and in good faith or (2) Buyer has been advised in writing by
counsel that a conflict exists between a Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller in
connection with the defense thereof that would prevent Seller or their counsel
from defending such audit or proceeding and Seller fails to cure such conflict
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice thereof, Buyer
may, without any effect on the right to indemnification under this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereunder, defend the same
actively, diligently and in good faith, including, but not limited to,
settling such audit or proceeding after giving twelve (12) Business Days prior
written notice to Seller setting forth the terms and conditions of such
settlement. With respect to such an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding (A) which involves a proposed assessment or claim (or may result in
an assessment or claim) for Taxes that applies to both a Pre-Closing Tax
Period and a post-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle Period) or (B)
which involves a change of accounting method or similar issue that recurs for
a taxable period or portion thereof that ends after the Closing Date (whether
or not the subject of an audit or proceeding at such time), (i) each party
hereto may participate in the audit or proceeding, (ii) the audit or
proceeding shall be controlled by that party hereto which would bear the
burden of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any
corresponding adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for the next five
(5) Tax periods and (iii) each party hereto shall bear the appropriate portion
of the expenses of such audit or proceeding. The principle set forth in the
preceding sentence shall govern also for purposes of deciding any issue that
must be decided jointly (in particular, choice of judicial forum) in
situations in which separate issues are otherwise controlled hereunder by
Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate and to act in good
faith, and Buyer agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to cooperate and to
act in good faith, in conducting, and in the defense against or compromise of
any claim in, any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding subject to
this Section 7.5(k). The Seller shall be entitled to control any proposed
assessment or claim in an audit, administrative or juridical proceeding
involving a  \t\t

consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of which any of the Acquired
Companies was a member, provided that to the extent any proposed assessment or
claim in an audit, administrative or judicial proceeding involving a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of which any of the Acquired
Companies was a member that could reasonably be expected to result in Tax
liability to the Buyer or the Acquired Companies for which the Buyer is not
indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, then Sellers shall keep the Buyer and
Acquired Companies reasonably informed as to such proceedings, and in no event
shall Seller or any other party controlling such audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding settle or otherwise compromise such audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.5(k) shall
in any way limit or modify any of Buyer's rights under Section 7.5(h). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEmployee Matters.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNot later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall offer, or cause its Affiliates to offer, in writing employment to each
Employee, effective as of immediately following the Closing, other than the
Employees set forth on Schedule 7.6. Such written offer of employment shall
include with respect to each Employee (i) at least the same base salary or
wage rate and target cash incentive opportunities (other than any retention or
change-of-control incentive opportunities) as were provided to such employee
by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
such health, welfare and retirement benefits (including dental and vision
benefits) that are at least substantially equivalent to those provided in the
Seller Plans and all other employee benefits, if any, that are offered to
similarly situated employees of Buyer under the Buyer Plans. Each Employee
who accepts Buyer's offer of employment shall become as of the Closing Date a
transferred employee ("Transferred Employee"). As of the Closing, Seller
shall terminate the employment of each Transferred Employee, and release, from
and following the Closing, each Transferred Employee from any non-competition
or non-solicitation obligation, or any confidentiality obligation with respect
to any confidential information of the Business, owed to Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (whether under Seller's Senior
Officer Severance Plan or under any other Contract, plan or policy).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEffective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees shall
cease participation in any and all employee benefit plans provided by Seller
and its Affiliates immediately before the Closing Date (other than the
Retention Plans) ("Seller Plans"), and all employee benefits provided to the
Transferred Employees shall be provided to the Transferred Employees under
employee benefit plans sponsored, maintained or otherwise provided by Buyer or
its Affiliates (the "Buyer Plans"). Each Transferred Employee shall be
eligible to participate, effective as of the Closing Date, and without any
waiting time, in any and all Buyer Plans to the extent coverage under such
Buyer Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Seller Plan in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately before the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit Transferred
Employees for service earned on and prior to the Closing Date with Seller and
its Affiliates, and any of their respective predecessors, in addition to
service earned with Buyer and its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, to
the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or
the calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and other benefits
(but not for purposes of defined benefit pension benefit accruals or of
benefits under any post-retirement or post-employment welfare plan) under any
Buyer Plan. On the Closing Date, prior to the Closing, Seller shall pay to
each Transferred Employee an amount equal to the value of any vacation, Paid
Personal Leave or other paid time (as applicable) accrued by such Transferred
Employee under the applicable policy of Seller, but unused, as of the Closing
Date. For purposes of each Buyer Plan, Buyer shall cause all preexisting
condition exclusions of such Buyer Plan to be waived for such employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent waived under the Seller Plans.

and any liability incurred under the WARN Act that is incurred or accrued
following the Closing, in each case with respect to any Transferred Employee.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tOn or before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a true
and complete list, by date and location, of employees who have experienced or
will experience an employment loss or layoff (as defined under the WARN Act)
within the ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date at any site owned or
leased by Seller or any Acquired Company where Transferred Employees will be
located after the Closing.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe provisions of this Section 7.6 are for the benefit of Buyer and
Seller only, and no employee or other Service Provider of Seller or any
Acquired Company shall have any rights under this Section 7.6. Nothing herein
expressed or implied shall be deemed an amendment of any employee benefit
plan, constitute the establishment of any other employee benefit plan, or
otherwise confer upon any employee of Seller or any Acquired Company, or any
legal representatives or beneficiaries thereof, any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period or to be covered under or by any employee benefit plan or arrangement,
or shall cause the employment status of any employee to be other than
terminable at will. \t\t

complied with by Seller at or prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

qualifiers and material adverse effect qualifiers set forth therein) shall

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFrustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Seller nor Buyer may rely
on or assert the failure of any condition set forth in this Article VIII, as
the case may be, if such failure results from or was caused by such party's
failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTermination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated herein may be abandoned, prior to the Closing solely: \t\t

by Buyer, if (i) a breach or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this Agreement shall
have occurred which has prevented the satisfaction of one or more of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and has not been waived by Buyer or, if
susceptible to cure, cured by Seller within twenty (20) days after written
notice thereof from Buyer and (ii) Buyer has not materially breached any
provision of this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tby Seller, if (i) a breach or failure to perform any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred which has prevented the satisfaction of one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 and has not been waived by
Seller or, if susceptible to cure, cured by Buyer within twenty (20) days
after written notice thereof from Seller and (ii) Seller has not materially
breached any provision of this Agreement; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tby Buyer or Seller if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before January 4, 2016 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that if the
non-terminating party hereto is in material compliance with its covenants set
forth in Section 7.2 and either or both of (A) the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.1(e) or 8.2(d) (as applicable) have not been satisfied and (B) any
other condition set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 (as applicable) have not been
satisfied as result of the effectiveness of a temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order preventing the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement arising with respect to the
HSR Act or any Other Antitrust Laws, then the Outside Date shall be extended
to February 2, 2016), and (ii) the terminating party has not materially
breached any provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event of termination and abandonment by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to this Section 8.4, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given
to the other party or parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and,
subject to Section 8.5, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
be abandoned, without further action by Buyer or Seller.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEffect of Termination.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.4
shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder and none
of the parties shall have any liability to the other party hereunder, except
that (i) Section 6.3(f), Section 7.1 and this Section 8.5 (including the
obligation to pay the Termination Fee, if applicable, subject to the
limitations in Section 8.5(c)) and Article X shall survive any such
termination, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve the Seller from liability
for any willful breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement prior to
such termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement, and
regardless of the reason for the termination, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and any
such termination shall not amend, modify, release, waive or otherwise limit
any rights or obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event of termination by (i) Seller pursuant to Section 8.4(c)
or (ii) either party pursuant to Section 8.4(d) if in the case of this clause
(ii), (A) the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.1 are satisfied
or capable of being satisfied or are waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of
which shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing), and (B) Buyer has
failed to satisfy its obligations to effect the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3, Buyer shall
promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of
such termination, pay or cause to the paid to Seller, by wire transfer of same
day funds an amount equal to $8,500,000 (the "Termination Fee"), without
offset or deduction of any kind. If Buyer fails to timely pay the Termination
Fee when due pursuant to this Section 8.5(b), and in order to obtain payment,
Seller commences a Suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment
against Buyer and/or the Sponsor, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to

 \t\t

Seller, Seller's reasonable and documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such Suit, together
with interest on the Termination Fee at the rate of 8.0% per annum compounding
quarterly from the date such payment was required to be made through the date
such payment was actually received (collectively, the "Seller Recovery
Costs"). It is agreed that the Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not
a penalty, and the payment of the Termination Fee in the circumstances
specified herein is supported by due and sufficient consideration (including
the fact that Seller would not be entitled to receive the Purchase Price and
would suffer other Losses of an incalculable nature and amount). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, the right of Seller to
receive (i) the Termination Fee, (ii) the Seller Recovery Costs, and (iii) any
indemnity or expense reimbursement obligations under Section 6.3(f)
(collectively, the "Obligations"), including from Sponsor pursuant to the
Sponsor Guaranty, if the Obligations are payable and are paid in full, shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquired Companies, Seller and any of
their shareholders, directors, officers and Affiliates (the "Seller Related
Parties") against Buyer, its shareholders, and any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
management company, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, Buyer, including and the Lenders, or any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
management company, stockholder, equityholder, controlling person, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing (the "Buyer Related Parties"). From and after
a valid termination at this Agreement, and without limiting the effect of the
last sentence of this Section 8.5(c), if the Obligations are payable and are
paid in full, no Buyer Related Party shall have any other Liability for any or
all Losses suffered or incurred by the Acquired Companies, Seller or any other
Seller Related Party in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of the
Acquired Companies, Seller or any other Seller Related Party shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against Buyer or
any other Buyer Related Party or any Lender arising out of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any matters forming the basis
for such termination. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that
in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement by
Seller pursuant to Section 8.4(c), the right to the Termination Fee
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the losses that will be suffered by
reason of any such termination of this Agreement and constitutes liquidated
damages (and not a penalty). For the avoidance of doubt, while Seller may
pursue both a grant of specific performance pursuant to Section 10.12(b) and
the payment of the Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall Seller be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any
money damages, including all or any portion of the Termination Fee. \t\t

INDEMNIFICATION 

---|--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement and covenants or
other agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms contemplate
performance before the Closing shall survive the Closing until the date (the
"General Survival Date") which is the later to occur of (x) fifteen (15)
months following the Closing Date and (y) thirty (30) days following receipt
of the audited financial statements for the Business for FY2016 (except that
in no event shall such date be later than the date that is eighteen (18)
months following the Closing Date); provided, however, that (i) the
Fundamental Representations (other than the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.22 (Taxes)) shall survive the Closing indefinitely and (ii)
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.22 (Taxes) shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (taking into account any tolling periods and extensions  \t\t

under applicable law) plus thirty (30) days. The covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms contemplate
performance after the Closing shall survive the Closing for the period
contemplated by its terms. The indemnification obligations under this Article
IX shall terminate when the survival of the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to this Section 9.1;
provided, that, the indemnification obligation with respect to Losses arising
prior to such termination date shall not terminate if a claim with respect to
such Losses is made by the Indemnified Party in accordance with this Agreement
prior to such termination date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, claims based on fraud committed by or on behalf of Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall survive the Closing
indefinitely. \t\t

 \t\t\tIndemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFrom and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article IX, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Buyer
Indemnitee from and against any and all Suits, Orders, Liens, losses, damages,
Liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses, bonds, dues, assessments,
fines, penalties, Taxes, fees, costs (including costs of investigation,
defense and enforcement of this Agreement), expenses or amounts paid in
settlement (in each case, including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees
and expenses) ("Losses"), incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee that are caused
by: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(x) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any Seller Fundamental
Representation or (y) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any other
representation or warranty set forth in Article III or the Seller Closing
Certificate, in each case, as qualified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules (in
each case, assuming that all qualifications contained in Article III or the
Seller Closing Certificate, in each case, as qualified by the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, as to materiality, including each qualifying reference
to the defined term "Material Adverse Effect" and the words "material" and
"materially" and all similar phrases and words were deleted therefrom,
provided, however, that the foregoing deletion shall not apply to (A) Section
3.7(b), (B) Section 3.8(b), (C) Section 3.18, (D) the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" or "Permitted Lien" or (E) the use of the term
"Material Contract"); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(x) any breach or non-performance by Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or the Restrictive Covenant Agreement,
which by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing and (y) any
breach or non-performance by Seller of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, which by their terms contemplate performance
before or at the Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany Buyer Indemnified Taxes and any sales and use or similar Taxes of
the Acquired Companies (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Taxes
or payments in connection with any voluntary disclosure agreement or similar
program and related filings that are or could be filed) for any U.S. federal,
state, local or foreign jurisdiction for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or any
portion thereof);  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthose matters set forth on Schedule 9.2(a)(iv); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany Indebtedness of any Acquired Company outstanding as of the Closing
or any Transaction Expenses. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFrom and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article IX, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Seller
Indemnitee from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller
Indemnitee that are caused by: \t\t

 \t\t

any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty set forth in
Article IV or the Buyer Closing Certificate (in each case, assuming that all
qualifications contained in Article IV or the Buyer Closing Certificate as to
materiality, including each qualifying reference to the defined term "Material
Adverse Effect" and the words "material" and "materially" and all similar
phrases and words were deleted therefrom); or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany breach or non-performance by Buyer of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tLimitations on Liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller
shall not have any obligation under Section 9.2(a)(i)(y) unless and until (i)
the Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any matter or
series of related matters for which indemnification is to be provided under
Section 9.2(a)(i)(y) exceed $50,000, in which case Seller shall be liable for
all Losses with respect to such matter or matters, including the first $50,000
(subject to all other applicable requirements and limitations herein,
including Sections 9.3(b) and 9.3(c)) (such Losses, "Qualifying Losses"), and
(ii) the aggregate of all Qualifying Losses exceed $750,000 (the
"Deductible"), in which case Seller shall be liable under Section 9.2(a)(i)(y)
for only those Qualifying Losses in excess of the Deductible (subject to all
other applicable requirements and limitations contained herein). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event
shall the aggregate liability of Seller under Section 9.2(a)(i)(y) exceed
$16,500,000 (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall the aggregate liability of Seller under this
Agreement exceed the Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEach Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate all
Losses for which such Indemnified Party is or may be entitled to
indemnification hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf any Buyer Indemnitee actually receives insurance proceeds or
indemnity, contribution or similar payments in respect of Losses under this
Article IX prior to being indemnified with respect to such Losses under this
Article IX, the payment under this Article IX with respect to such Losses
shall be reduced by the amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments, less reasonable out-of-pocket attorney's
fees and other expenses or increased premiums incurred in connection with such
recovery. If Buyer Indemnitee receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity,
contribution or similar payments described in the preceding sentence after
being indemnified with respect to some or all of such Losses, Buyer
Indemnitee shall pay to Seller the lesser of (i) the amount of such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment, less reasonable out-
of-pocket attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such
recovery and (ii) the aggregate amount paid by Seller to any Buyer Indemnitee
with respect to such Losses. The amount of any and all Losses under Section
9.2(a) and Section 9.2(b) shall be determined net of any Tax benefits
(determined on a "with" and "without" basis) actually received in cash
(whether by actual receipt of cash Tax refund or an actual reduction of cash
Taxes due and owing) by any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification
hereunder arising from the deductibility against Taxes of any such Losses in
the year of the Loss or the immediately following two (2) years (such
determination of the amount and timing of any such Tax benefit to be
determined at the reasonable discretion of the Indemnified Person in good
faith). If an Indemnified Party receives any such Tax benefit described in
the preceding sentence after receiving an indemnification payment with respect
to a Loss, but within the two (2) year period described above in this Section
9.3(d), the Indemnified Party shall pay an amount equal to such Tax benefit to
the Indemnifying Party within ten (10) days of such Tax benefit being
realized.  \t\t

In no event shall any party be entitled to recover or make a claim for any
amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed to include (i)
punitive damages, except to the extent awarded in connection with any Third-
Party Claim and (ii) any Loss to the extent that the amount of such Loss is
reflected as a current liability in the determination of the Net Working
Capital on the Final Closing Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not have any right to indemnification under this Agreement
with respect to, or based on, Taxes to the extent such Taxes (i) except as the
result of a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.22(e), Section 3.22(f), Section 3.22(g) or Section 3.22(i), are
attributable to Tax periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date, (ii) are due to the unavailability in any Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits
or other Tax attribute from a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, (iii) result from transactions or actions taken by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Acquired Companies) on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not
expressly required by this Agreement, or (iv) do not arise from a Third Party
Claim. \t\t

 \t\t\tIndemnification Procedures. \t\t

 \t\t

|  \t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t (a) \t\t\tThird-Party Claims. The party making a claim under this
Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party"; and the party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article IX is referred to as the
"Indemnitor". If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any action, suit, claim, arbitration, mediation or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim") against
such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnitor is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnitor prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt
written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnitor of its
indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is
prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all written evidence thereof and all correspondence from or to such
third party (or its representatives) related to the matter giving rise to such
Third-Party Claim and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been sustained by the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in or, by giving written
notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume and control the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, in all events at the Indemnitor's expense and by the
Indemnitor's own counsel, so long as (i) the Indemnitor gives written notice
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitor has
given notice of the Third-Party Claim, (ii) the Third-Party Claim involves
only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief
against the Indemnitor, (iii) the Indemnified Party has not been advised by
counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnitor and
the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third-Party
Claim, (iv) the Third-Party Claim does not relate to or otherwise arise in
connection with Taxes (which shall be governed by Section 7.5) or any criminal
or regulatory enforcement action and (v) settlement of, an adverse judgment
with respect to, or conduct of the defense of the Third-Party Claim by the
Indemnitor is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely
to be adverse, in any material respect, to the Indemnified Party's reputation
or continuing business interests (including its relationships with current or
potential customers, suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its
business) and (vi) the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third-Party
Claim actively and diligently (provided this clauses (i) - (vi) shall not
apply to with respect to Third-Party Claims subject to indemnification under
Section 9.2(a)(iv)). In the event that the Indemnitor is permitted to and
does assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 9.4(b),
(i) it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to
avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such
Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the  \t\t

Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim
with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnitor's right to control the
defense thereof; provided, that the Indemnitor will pay the fees and expenses
of separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Party that are incurred after
notice of such Third Party Claim has be given in accordance herewith and prior
to the Indemnitor's assumption of control of the defense of the Third-Party
Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable
respects in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim. 

--- 

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSettlement of Third-Party Claims. If the Indemnitor and the
applicable third party wish to settle, or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to, a Third-Party Claim and the proposed settlement or judgment
(i) does not include any monetary damages payable by the Indemnified Party and
provides for the payment by the Indemnitor of money as sole relief for the
claimant, (ii) does not include any restriction on the operations of the
Indemnified Party and does not subject the Indemnified Party to any equitable
relief, (iii) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Law or the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnified Party, and (iv) provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liabilities in
connection with such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall give written
notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor may settle,
or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to, such Third-Party Claim
without the Indemnified Party's consent. If the Indemnitor does not deliver
the notice contemplated by Section 9.4(a)(i), or otherwise at any time fails
to conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently, the
Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to, the Third-Party Claim
in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Party need not
consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith). If such notice is given on a timely basis and the Indemnitor
conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently but any
of the conditions in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of Sections 9.4(a) is
or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnified Party may defend, and may consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to, the Third-Party Claim; provided, that the entry of any such
judgment consented to, or any such compromise or settlement effected, without
Seller's prior written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall not be binding on Seller and shall
have no dispositive effect with respect to whether or not Seller has any
obligation (or the amount of any obligation) hereunder or otherwise with
respect thereto.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tDirect Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnitor prompt written notice
thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligations, except to the
extent that the Indemnitor is prejudiced by reason of such failure. Such
notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, shall include copies of all written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnitor shall have thirty
(30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such
Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such thirty
(30)-day period, the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have rejected such claim,
in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as
may be available to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tExclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach of this Agreement, the Restrictive Covenant Agreement or
otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Restrictive
Covenant Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein and therein
(except for those items with respect to which the process set forth in Section
2.5 is the sole and exclusive remedy as set forth in Section 2.5(h)). Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, from and after the  \t\t

Closing, Buyer, for itself and the other Buyer Indemnitees, (a) agrees that no
legal action sounding in contribution, tort, strict liability or any other
legal theory may be maintained by any Buyer Indemnitee, or any other Person
for any breach of this Agreement or otherwise with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, and (b)
hereby waives any and all statutory rights of contribution or indemnification
that any of them might otherwise be entitled to under any Law or any similar
rules of law embodied in the common law. The limitations in this Section 9.5
shall not apply with respect to (a) any claims based on fraud committed by or
on behalf of Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
(b) in the case where a party seeks to obtain specific enforcement pursuant to
Section 10.12, or (c) with respect to the Ancillary Documents (other than the
Restrictive Covenant Agreement), which shall be governed by their terms, from
and after the Closing and shall not be subject to this Article IX. The rights
of each Buyer Indemnitee and Seller Indemnitee under this Article IX are
cumulative, and each Buyer Indemnitee and Seller Indemnitee will have the
right in any particular circumstance, in its sole discretion, to enforce any
provision of this Article IX without regard to the availability of a remedy
under any other provision of this Article IX. With respect to any claim
brought by a Buyer Indemnitee against any Seller Indemnitee under this
Agreement or otherwise relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by hereby or thereby, Seller expressly waives any right of
subrogation, contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against
the Acquired Companies with respect to any amounts owed by Seller pursuant to
this Article IX or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tCharacterization of Indemnity Payments. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, any payment made pursuant to this Article IX shall be
treated, for Tax purposes, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. \t\t

Agreement to its lenders providing financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for collateral security purposes, but in each
case, no such transfer or assignment will relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. \t\t

 \t\t\tGoverning Law. This Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto
shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of Law or
conflict of Laws rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that all disputes
and proceedings (in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or related
to the Debt Financing shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of law
provision (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York. \t\t

 \t\t\tConsent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAny suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the
event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any
such suit, action or other proceeding. A final judgment in any such suit,
action or other proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party's respective
address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for any such
action, suit or proceeding.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding clause (a) above, the parties hereto agree that none
of them will bring or support any suit, action or other proceeding of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Lenders in any way relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not
limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than federal
and New York state courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City
of New York (and appellate courts thereof). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tCounterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and any
party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed and
delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts
taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.  \t\t

agree that the delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and any
other agreements and documents at the Closing, may be effected by means of an

 \t\t\tNo Third Party Beneficiaries. Other than Article IX, which is
intended to benefit and may also be enforced by the Indemnified Parties, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lenders are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and may enforce, this Section 10.8 and Sections 8.5, 10.2,
10.4, 10.5, 10.6(b), 10.6(c), 10.8 and 10.16. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tEntire Agreement. This Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, any
Schedules hereto and the other documents, instruments and agreements
specifically referred to herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All Schedules, including
any Seller Disclosure Schedule, referred to herein are intended to be and
hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement and incorporated by
reference herein. Any and all previous agreements and understandings between
or among the parties regarding the subject matter hereof, whether written or
oral, are superseded by this Agreement, except for the Confidentiality
Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSeller Disclosure Schedules. Except as otherwise provided in the
Seller Disclosure Schedules, all capitalized terms therein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. Matters reflected in the Seller
Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be disclosed. No disclosure made in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules shall constitute an admission or determination that any fact or
matter so disclosed is material, has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, meets a dollar or other threshold set forth in
this Agreement or would otherwise be required to be disclosed. Information
disclosed in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule will qualify any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to the extent that the relevance
or applicability of the information disclosed with respect to any such
representation or warranty, notwithstanding the absence of a reference or
cross-reference to such other representation or warranty on any such Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the absence of a reference or cross-reference to such
Seller Disclosure Schedule in such representation or warranty, to other
Section(s) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure. No
disclosure in the Seller Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach
or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred. \t\t

 \t\t\tCaptions. All captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not form a part of this Agreement and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t\tRemedies. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the failure of any party
to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder will cause irreparable
injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be
an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party
hereto of its covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, such party
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
such breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such other party,
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent such breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance
with, the covenants and obligations of such  \t\t

other party under this Agreement. Each of the parties hereby agrees not to
raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such parties under this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action
for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Seller
shall be entitled to seek specific performance pursuant to this Section 10.12
of Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing only in the event that (a) all
conditions in Section 8.1 have been satisfied or waived (other than those to
be satisfied at the Closing), the Marketing Period has ended and Buyer fails
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder on the date the Closing
should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3, (b) the financing provided for
by the Debt Commitment Letter (or Alternative Financing) has been or would be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and
(c) Seller has confirmed that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller be entitled to receive both
(x) a grant of specific performance to cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated and (y) payment of the Termination Fee.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary or otherwise, it is
acknowledged and agreed that Seller shall be entitled to seek specific
performance, pursuant to and subject to this Section 10.12, to cause Buyer to
consummate the Closing no earlier than the date required under Section
2.3. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSeverability. Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity or unenforceability without invalidating or rendering unenforceable
the remaining provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or unenforceability
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such
provision in any other jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tInterpretation. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or
interpreted against any party by virtue of the authorship of this Agreement
shall not apply to the construction and interpretation hereof. The parties
agree that any drafts of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document prior to the
final fully executed drafts shall not be used for purposes of interpreting any
provision thereof, and each of the parties agrees that no party or any
Affiliate thereof shall make any claim, assert any defense or otherwise take
any position inconsistent with the foregoing in connection with any Suit among
any of the foregoing. For the purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the
meaning assigned to each term defined herein shall be equally applicable to
both the singular and the plural forms of such term and vice versa, and words
denoting either gender shall include both genders as the context requires; (b)
where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms
shall have a corresponding meaning; (c) the terms "hereof," "herein,"
"hereunder," "hereby" and "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless
otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement; (d) when a reference is made in
this Agreement to an Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit or Schedule, such
reference is to an Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified; (e) the word "include," "includes," and
"including" when used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "but not limited to," unless otherwise specified; and (f) all accounting
terms used and not defined herein have the respective meanings given to them
under GAAP. The phrase "made available", "delivered" or "provided" in the
context of documents made available or delivered or provided to by any party
to Buyer means uploaded to the "Project Einstein" electronic data room hosted
by RR Donnelley and accessible for viewing by Buyer and/or its Representatives
prior to 6:00 a.m., Pacific time, on the Business Day immediately prior to the

Privilege; Conflicts of Interest.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer: (i) acknowledges that Paul Hastings LLP ("Paul Hastings") has
represented the Acquired Companies in connection with the transactions
provided for herein and that, effective upon the Closing, the Acquired
Companies shall, without the necessity of further documentation of transfer,
be deemed to have irrevocably assigned and transferred to Seller immediately
prior to the Closing, on behalf of the Acquired Companies, all of the Acquired
Companies', right to, title to and interest in all communications with, and
work product of, Paul Hastings as they relate to this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the preparation
and negotiation thereof, together with all written or other materials
consisting of, containing, summarizing or embodying such communications and
work product (collectively, the "Deal Communications"), and (ii) agree that
the intent and effect of this provision is to grant Seller control over the
exercise of the attorney-client privilege held by any Acquired Company in
respect of such Deal Communications, and (iii) agree that after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies will not (and Buyer will cause the Acquired Companies
not to) knowingly waive the attorney-client privilege belonging to any
Acquired Company, if any, relating to any matter relating to such Deal
Communications, without the express written consent of Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies and a third party (including any
Governmental Entity) other than a party to this Agreement or its Affiliates
after the Closing, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Paul
Hastings or Seller to such third party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe parties understand and agree that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement could result in the inadvertent
disclosure of such Deal Communications that may be confidential, eligible to
be subject to a claim of privilege, or otherwise protected from disclosure.
The parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of such Deal
Communications that may be confidential, subject to a claim of privilege, or
otherwise protected from disclosure will not constitute a waiver of or
otherwise prejudice any claim of confidentiality, privilege, or protection
from disclosure, including, but not limited to, with respect to information
involving or concerning the same subject matter as such Deal Communications.
The parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to return any inadvertently
disclosed information to the disclosing party promptly upon becoming aware of
its existence. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tBuyer and Seller further intend that Seller shall have the right,
should it so choose, to have the benefit of representation by Paul Hastings in
connection with post-Closing matters concerning this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder.
Accordingly, each Buyer and Seller agree that this Agreement will (i)
constitute consultation with respect to the potential conflict of interest
that Paul Hastings may have as a result of its representation of the Acquired
Companies both historically and in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder, (ii) confirm that each party understands the risks associated with
potential conflicts of interest and that the parties have alternatives to
waiving the potential conflict (including refusing to waive the potential
conflict or declining to engage in the matter giving rise to the potential
conflict), and (iii) that the parties still wish to consent to Paul Hastings's
representation, if requested, of Seller in connection with matters relating to
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and/or the transactions contemplated
hereunder and/or thereunder, and waive any conflicts of interest which may
exist as a result of such representations, including in connection with any
litigation or adversarial proceeding arising among the parties, or any of
them, regarding this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereunder and thereunder. \t\t

current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, management company, stockholder, equityholder, controlling
person, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any
financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the

and Sponsor) shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law
or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, except as
otherwise provided in the Sponsor Guaranty and/or Equity Commitment Letter,

otherwise set forth in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, this
Agreement, the Sponsor Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter, or the

all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be
available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard
the entity form of a party or otherwise impose liability of a party on any
Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity,
agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business
enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise,
and (b) each party hereto disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates
with respect to the performance of this Agreement or any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 10.16 will limit Buyer's
ability to rely on those representations and warranties set forth in Article

or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and any such claims, rights
and causes of action are disclaimed and released in full. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) the Nonparty Affiliates, including the Debt Financing Sources,
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 10.16, each of whom may
