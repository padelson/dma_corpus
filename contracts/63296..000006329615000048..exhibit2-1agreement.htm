(c) The Sellers and Optionholders may be entitled to receive additional

1.04. _Working Capital; Post-Closing Adjustment; Cash and Cash Equivalents_.

  

(a) "Working Capital" is defined as set out on _Schedule_1.04(a), and
Estimated Working Capital will be prepared according to the methodology set
out in _Section_1.04(b). The Working Capital Target ("Working Capital Target")
is Thirty Four Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($34,200,000). At least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers\'
Representative will deliver to Buyer (x) a certificate that the condition set
forth on _Schedule_6.01(h) has been satisfied and (y) a good faith estimate
(the "Estimated Closing Statement") of (i) the Working Capital as of 11:59
p.m. EST on the Closing Date, without giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("Estimated Working Capital"), (ii) the Company
Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Estimated Company
Indebtedness") and (iii) the Company Transaction Expenses as of immediately
prior to the Closing (the "Estimated Company Transaction Expenses"), in each
case, on a reasonable basis using the Company\'s then available financial
information.

  

(b) Within seventy-five (75) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare
and deliver to the Sellers\' Representative (i) a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a
statement setting forth (A) Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. EST on the
Closing Date, without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) the Company Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing
without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(C) the Company Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior to the Closing,
in each case, as determined by reference to the Closing Balance Sheet,
together with all reasonable supporting documentation for purposes of
understanding and verifying such amounts (such statement shall be referred to
herein as the "Proposed Closing Statement"). The Estimated Closing Statement,
the Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Closing Statement shall be prepared
in conformity with (i) the accounting principles, policies, procedures,
categorizations and methodologies specifically set forth on _Schedule_1.04(a),
and (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with clause (i), GAAP.

  

(c) The Sellers\' Representative will have a period of thirty (30) days after
its receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Proposed Closing Statement,
together with all reasonable supporting documentation, to review the same and
Buyer\'s calculation of Working Capital, the Company Indebtedness and the
Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as of the Closing and to notify
Buyer of any disputes regarding the same (the "Review Period"). As part of
such review, the Sellers\' Representative and its advisors will have
reasonable access during normal business hours to Buyer\'s work papers and to
the books and records on which the Closing Balance Sheet is based; provided
that (i) the provision of any information or access pursuant to this
_Section_1.04 shall be subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings
and, if applicable, execution of customary release letters requested by the
Company\'s independent auditors in connection with the sharing of their work
papers and (ii) nothing in this _Section_1.04 shall require any party to
disclose information that is subject to legal privilege.

  

(d) Prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Sellers\' Representative
shall notify Buyer of any objections or proposed changes to the Proposed
Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet and the parties shall negotiate
in good faith in an effort to resolve any dispute. If the Sellers\'
Representative does not notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Proposed
Closing Statement or the Closing Balance Sheet within the Review Period, such
Proposed Closing Statement and Closing Balance Sheet will be final, conclusive
and binding on the parties. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives notice of the same, the parties
shall submit the dispute for resolution to Ernst and Young, LLP or a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm who is mutually agreeable and shall not
have had a material relationship with the Sellers, Buyer, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates within two years preceding the appointment (the
"CPA Firm"). If Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative cannot agree on the
selection of an independent accounting firm to act as CPA Firm within such
time period, Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative shall request that the
American Arbitration Association appoint an impartial CPA Firm, and such
appointment shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. Buyer and the
Sellers\' Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the CPA Firm to make a determination within twenty (20) days after acceptance
of its appointment as CPA Firm, based solely on written submissions by Buyer
and the Sellers\' Representative and their respective representatives and not
by independent review, only those issues in dispute and shall render a written
report as to the resolution of the dispute and the resulting computation of
the Working Capital as of the Closing, the Company Indebtedness as of the
Closing and the Company Transaction Expenses as of the Closing which shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. The CPA Firm shall resolve any such
disagreements acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, and its decision
shall be final and binding on the parties upon delivery of its written report.
In resolving any disputed item, the CPA Firm (i) shall be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement and (ii) may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such items claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such items claimed by either party. The fees,
costs and expenses of the CPA Firm (A) shall be borne by Buyer in the
proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted that
are successfully disputed by the Sellers\' Representative (as finally
determined by the CPA Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of such items
so submitted and (B) shall be borne by the Sellers and the Optionholders in
the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items so
submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by the Sellers\' Representative (as
finally determined by the CPA Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of
such items so submitted.

  

(e) Based on the Working Capital as of the Closing as finally determined (the
"Final Working Capital"), the Company Indebtedness as of the Closing as
finally determined (the "Final Company Indebtedness") and the Company
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing as finally determined (the "Final
Company Transaction Expenses"), the Estimated Purchase Price will be adjusted
on a dollar-for-dollar basis as follows (the aggregate adjustment, the
"Adjustment Amount"): (i) if the Final Working Capital is less than Estimated
Working Capital, the Estimated Purchase Price will be decreased by the dollar
amount of such shortfall and if Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated
Working Capital, the Estimated Purchase Price will be increased by the dollar
amount of such excess; (ii) if the Final Company Indebtedness exceeds the
Estimated Company Indebtedness, the Estimated Purchase Price will be decreased
by the dollar amount of such excess and if the Final Company Indebtedness is
less than the Estimated Company Indebtedness, the Estimated Purchase Price
will be increased by the dollar amount of such shortfall and (iii) if the
Final Company Transaction Expenses exceeds the Estimated Company Transaction
Expenses, the Estimated Purchase Price will be decreased by the dollar amount
of such excess and if the Final Company Transaction Expenses is less than the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses, the Estimated Purchase Price will be
increased by the dollar amount of such shortfall. Within five (5) Business
Days following the determination of the Final Working Capital, the Final
Company Indebtedness and the Final Company Transaction Expenses (i) if the
Adjustment Amount results in an increase in the Estimated Purchase Price,
Buyer will pay to each Seller and Optionholder such Person\'s Stakeholder
Transaction Percentage of the Adjustment Amount, or (ii) if the Adjustment
Amount results in a reduction in the Estimated Purchase Price, the Sellers\'
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers and the Optionholders, will pay to
Buyer the Adjustment Amount by bank wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer. The Estimated Purchase
Price, as finally adjusted by the Adjustment Amount, is referred to as the
"Purchase Price."

  

1.05. _Allocation_.

  

(a) The Purchase Price (including any liabilities of the Company or other
consideration treated as purchase consideration for Income Tax purposes),
reduced by a portion of the Purchase Price paid to and other amounts of
purchase consideration properly attributable to the purchase of the Blocker
Shares, shall be allocated among the assets of the Company (including for
purposes of Code Section 751 and 755) in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 1.05. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer will
prepare and deliver to the Sellers\' Representative a purchase price
allocation schedule (the "Allocation"). The Sellers\' Representative will have
a period of 30 days after its receipt of the Allocation to review the
Allocation and to notify Buyer of any disputes regarding the Allocation. If
the Sellers\' Representative does not notify Buyer of a dispute with respect
to the Allocation within 30 days after its receipt, the Allocation will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If the parties are unable to
resolve such dispute within 30 days after Buyer receives notice of the same,
the parties shall submit the dispute for resolution to the CPA Firm. The CPA
Firm shall resolve any such disagreements acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, and its decision shall be final and binding on the parties upon
delivery of its written report. In resolving any disputed item, the fees,
costs and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-
half by the Sellers.

  

(b) The Sellers\' Representative, each Seller, Buyer and the Company Parties
shall (i) cooperate to revise the Allocation upon any adjustment to the
Purchase Price or purchase consideration for Income Tax purposes, and (ii) use
the Allocation for all Tax reporting purposes; but, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not be required to use the Allocation for purposes of GAAP
financial statements or any disclosures related thereto. Buyer and the Sellers
agree (i) to file all Tax Returns and determine all Taxes, including all Taxes
based on or measured by net income or profits, in accordance with and based
upon the Allocation and (ii) not to take any position inconsistent with such
allocation in any Tax audit or judicial or administrative proceeding relating
to Taxes, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative or
unless otherwise required by any Governmental Authority.

  

1.06. _Relationship Among the Sellers_.

  

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints the Sellers\' Representative as
the sole representative of the Sellers to act as the agent and on behalf of
such Sellers regarding any matter relating to or under this Agreement,
including for the purposes of: (i) making decisions with respect to the
determination of Working Capital, Company Indebtedness, and Company
Transaction Expenses under _Section_1.04; (ii) determining whether the
conditions to closing in _Article_VI have been satisfied and supervising the
Closing, including waiving any condition, as determined by the Sellers\'
Representative, in its sole discretion; (iii) taking any action that may be
necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers\' Representative, in its
sole discretion, in connection with the termination of this Agreement in

necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers\' Representative, in its
sole discretion, in connection with the amendment of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_9.11; (v) accepting notices on behalf of the Sellers
in accordance with _Section_9.06 (other than with respect to notice of an
indemnity claim made against the Partners Group Sellers); (vi) taking any and
all actions that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by the Sellers\'
Representative, in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or
entering into settlements and compromises of any disputes relating to the

for indemnification pursuant to _Article_VIII (other than with respect to an
indemnity claim made against the Partners Group Sellers); (vii) executing and
delivering, on behalf of the Sellers, any and all notices, documents or
certificates to be executed by the Sellers, in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby; and (viii) granting any consent,
waiver or approval on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement. As the
representative of the Sellers under this Agreement, the Sellers\'
Representative shall act as the agent for all Sellers, shall have authority to
bind each such Person in accordance with this Agreement, and Buyer may rely on
such appointment and authority until the receipt of notice of the appointment
of a successor upon two (2) Business Days\' prior written notice to Buyer.
Buyer may conclusively rely upon, without independent verification or
investigation, all decisions made by the Sellers\' Representative in
connection with this Agreement in writing and signed by an officer of the
Sellers\' Representative.

  

(b) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers\' Representative
shall retain the Seller Reserve Amount for the purpose of paying (x) any fees,
costs and expenses incurred by the Sellers\' Representative in connection with
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including making any
payments required under _Section_1.04 and each of the documents to be executed
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) any
indemnification obligations of the Sellers, to the extent such indemnification
obligations are borne pro rata among the Sellers and Optionholders. Each
Seller further acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers\' Representative shall
have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable in its sole discretion, to
distribute to any Seller at any time such Seller\'s Seller Transaction
Percentage of the Seller Reserve Amount upon the delivery by such Seller to
the Sellers\' Representative (in favor of the Sellers\' Representative on
behalf of such Seller) of (i) a letter of credit or (ii) such other
undertaking, in either case, in support of such Seller\'s obligations
hereunder and with such form and substance acceptable to the Sellers\'
Representative, in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of
the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that there can be no assurances that any
of the Seller Reserve Amount will be paid or disbursed to the Sellers.

  

(c) The Sellers\' Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to
incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Sellers\' Representative deems to
be necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and each of the documents to be executed in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers\'
Representative shall be reimbursed for all such fees, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses) first from the
Seller Reserve Amount and, to the extent that such fees, costs and expenses
exceed such amount, then by the Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their
respective Seller Transaction Percentages. All interest accrued on the Seller
Reserve Amount shall be paid to, and shall be the property of, the Sellers\'
Representative.

  

(d) Each Seller hereby appoints the Sellers\' Representative as such Seller\'s
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full powers of substitution
and resubstitution, in such Seller\'s name, place and stead, in any and all
capacities, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent, full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and
necessary to be done in connection with the sale of such Seller\'s Seller
Interests and the related cancellation of the Options as fully to all intents
and purposes as such Seller might or could do in person.

  

(e) The Sellers\' Representative shall have no liability to Buyer for any
default under this Agreement by any other Seller. Except for intentional fraud
on its part, the Sellers\' Representative shall have no liability to any other
Seller under this Agreement for any action or omission by the Sellers\'
Representative on behalf of the other Sellers.

  

1.07. _Treatment of_ _Options_. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall cause the Company to take all actions necessary (if any) so all Options
then outstanding shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not
currently exercisable) and, immediately prior to the Closing, each Option not
theretofore exercised shall be cancelled without any future liability to
Buyer, the Company or any other Person after the Closing, in exchange for the
right to receive the payment described in the following sentence. Subject to
the other provisions of this _Section _1.07, each holder of an Option that is
cancelled pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, in respect of such Option,
be entitled to a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (I) the
excess, if any, of (i) the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the Estimated
Purchase Price _plus_ the aggregate exercise price of all Options outstanding
as of the time of cancellation _by_ (B) the sum of the total number of Class A
Interests outstanding as of the Closing (after giving effect to the Option
Cancellation) and the number of shares of Class A Interests subject to all
Options outstanding at the time of cancellation _over_ (ii) the applicable
Exercise Price of each Option, _multiplied_ _by_ (II) the number of shares of
Class A Interests underlying such Options. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no payment shall be made to any Optionholder
pursuant to this Agreement or any ancillary agreement after the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

1.08. _Withholding_. Buyer, the Company Parties, and their respective
Affiliates, agents and designees, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Seller, Optionholder or any other Person such amounts (the "Withholding
Amounts") as Buyer, the Company or any Affiliate, agent or designee thereof is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law and to properly remit such Withholding Amounts to the
appropriate Tax or Governmental Authority. To the extent that such Withholding
Amounts are so withheld and paid to the applicable Tax or Governmental
Authority, such Withholding Amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such
withholding and deduction was made.

_Section_6.07(c) (collectively, "Remedial Actions") shall constitute a
"Burdensome Condition" if and to the extent such Remedial Actions,
individually or in the aggregate with all other Remedial Actions taken
together, would reasonably be expected to result in an annual loss of gross
revenues to the Company Parties and Buyer in the aggregate in excess of
Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) (the "Remedial Action Threshold");
_provided_ that Buyer shall not agree to any Remedial Action in excess of the
Remedial Action Threshold without the prior written consent of the Company and
Buyer shall only take the minimal Remedial Actions required by the applicable
Governmental Authority. Nothing in this _Section _6.07 shall require Parent,
Buyer, the Company or their respective subsidiaries to take or agree to take
any action with respect to its assets, businesses or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

  

(e) If any Remedial Actions required to be taken pursuant to this
_Section_6.07 are consummated, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to (to the extent a positive number) one-half of (x) 1.14
multiplied by the gross revenue of the assets, businesses and entities subject
to such Remedial Actions less, (y) in the case of Remedial Actions involving
the divestiture, disposal, leasing, licensing or transferring of any assets or
entities, the aggregate amount of net proceeds received by Buyer and its
Affiliates from the purchasers, transferors or other counterparties in
connection with the consummation of such Remedial Actions. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the value of any divestiture,
disposal, leasing, licensing or transferring of any assets or entities in
connection with a Remedial Action.

  

(f) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any
communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by Governmental Rule,
each party shall permit the other party to review in advance any proposed
material communication to any Governmental Authority. If any party or any
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. None of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or
other inquiry relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Buyer will advise the
Sellers\' Representative promptly in respect of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Buyer proposes to make or
enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  

6.08. _Release and Covenant Not to Sue_.

  

(a) Sellers, on behalf of themselves, their Affiliates and any predecessors,
successors and assigns of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (collectively,
the "Seller Related Parties"), hereby unequivocally, irrevocably and
unconditionally releases, surrenders, acquits and forever discharges the
Company Parties, Blockers, Parent, Buyer and their respective subsidiaries and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing (each,
a "Buyer Released Party" and, collectively, the "Buyer Released Parties"),
from any and all Liabilities to the Seller Related Parties, whether or not
known, suspected, foreseen or unforeseen, relating in any way to or in
connection with any matter or thing at any time prior to or as of the Closing
(the "Released Claims"); provided that this _Section_6.08 shall not release
Buyer from Liabilities arising out of this Agreement, fraud or willful
misconduct.

  

(b) The Sellers, on behalf of each of the Seller Related Parties, hereby
unequivocally, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate proceedings with respect to, institute, assert or
threaten to assert any Released Claim against any of the Buyer Released
Parties. This _Section_6.08 shall constitute a complete defense to any
Released Claim.

  

(c) Buyer and Parent, on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates and
any predecessors, successors and assigns of Buyer, Parent or any of their
Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Related Parties"), hereby unequivocally,
irrevocably and unconditionally releases, surrenders, acquits and forever
discharges the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, subsidiaries and each
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
and the successors and assigns of all of the foregoing (each, a "Seller
Released Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Released Parties"), from any
and all Liabilities to the Buyer Related Parties for Released Claims; provided
that this _Section_6.08 shall not release the Sellers from Liabilities arising
out of this Agreement, fraud or willful misconduct.

  

(d) Buyer and Parent, on behalf of each of the Buyer Related Parties, hereby
unequivocally, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate proceedings with respect to, institute, assert or
threaten to assert any Released Claim against any of the Seller Released
Parties. This _Section_6.08 shall constitute a complete defense to any
Released Claim.

  

(e) The Sellers, on behalf of themselves and each of the Seller Related
Parties, and Parent and Buyer, on behalf of themselves and each of the Buyer
Related Parties, hereby expressly waives any rights or benefits that all of
them or any of them, might otherwise have under Section 1542 of the California
Civil Code or any other similar statute or law of California or any other
state or federal jurisdiction, to the full extent that such rights and
benefits may be waived. Section 1542 of the California Civil Code reads as
follows: A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does
not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release
which if known to him must have materially affected his settlement with the
debtor.

  

(f) Each of the Buyer Released Parties and Seller Released Parties shall be
deemed a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_6.08 and shall be entitled
to enforce the provisions hereof as if it were a party hereto.

  

6.09. _Payoff of Company Indebtedness_. The Sellers\' Representative will
deliver to Buyer, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, payoff letters (the "Payoff Letters") with respect to Repaid
Indebtedness, which letters shall specify (a) the aggregate amount required to
be paid in order to repay in full the Company Indebtedness related to such
Payoff Letter (including any and all accrued but unpaid interest and
prepayment penalty obligations due upon repayment), (b) payment instructions
on the projected Closing Date, as well as the per diem amount to be added
thereto in the event that the actual Closing Date is a date subsequent to the
projected Closing Date and (c) wire instructions to make such payoff. Each
such Payoff Letter shall include customary undertakings to release in full,
upon payment of the amounts set forth in such Payoff Letters, all Liens
securing the Company Indebtedness related to such Payoff Letter and to
promptly prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Authority such
instruments as may be required to effect or evidence such release or shall
include authorization for the Company Parties or another party designated by
the Company Parties to prepare and file any such instruments.

  

6.10. _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_. The Sellers\' Representative
will deliver to Buyer, not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date: (a) invoices reflecting each of the amounts of the Company
Transaction Expenses to be paid by Buyer at Closing and (b) wire instructions
to make such payment.

  

6.11. _280G Vote_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall (i) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such individual of any and all
payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that such payments
and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and (ii) submit to its interestholders for a vote all such waived
payments in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the interestholders
in a manner that satisfies the equityholder approval requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, no
payment received by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute
payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code. Such vote shall establish the
"disqualified individual\'s" right to the payment or other compensation. In
addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to interestholders
entitled to vote of all material facts concerning all payments that, but for
such vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" to any such "disqualified
individual" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner intended to satisfy
Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

6.12. _FIRPTA Certificate_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company, the
Blockers, and/or the Sellers, as applicable, shall provide to Buyer
certificates in compliance with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
Section 1445 of the Code and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer certifying that withholding is not required, (a) in the case of the
Blocker Sellers, with respect to the transfer of the Blocker Shares, and (b)
in the case of all other Sellers, with respect to the transfer of the Seller
Class A Interests. In the event that the Company, a Blocker or a Seller is
unable to provide such a certificate, Buyer\'s sole remedy shall be to make an
appropriate withholding under Sections 897 and 1445 of the Code.

  


 

  

ARTICLE VII 
  _CERTAIN POST-CLOSING MATTERS_

  

7.01. _Access to Information_. After the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company
Parties and Blockers to make available to the Sellers\' Representative for any
legitimate business purpose any and all books and records of the Company
Parties and Blockers existing on the Closing Date; provided, that such access
will be upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours, at the
Sellers\' expense and conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably
interfere with the Company Parties\' business. Buyer will cause the Company
Parties to hold all of such books and records for a period of five (5) years
from the Closing Date.

  

7.02. _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) Each individual who is employed by a Company Party immediately prior to
the Closing Date shall remain an employee of such Company Party following the
Closing Date (each such employee, an "Affected Employee"); provided, however,
that this _Section_7.02(a) shall not be construed to limit the ability of the
applicable employer to terminate the employment of any Affected Employee
following the Closing Date in accordance with applicable law.

  

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause the applicable Company Party to, give Affected
Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility under any employee benefit
plans or arrangements maintained by Buyer or any Company Party providing
benefits to any Affected Employee after the Closing to the same extent such
service credit was granted under the corresponding Plan immediately prior to
the Closing Date with respect to eligibility, except to the extent any such
service credit would result in the duplication of benefits.

  

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Parties to, waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees
under any welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing
Plans"), other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect
with respect to such Affected Employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Closing Date under any welfare plan maintained for the Affected Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date and as if the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement had not taken place.

  

(d) Subject to the requirements under applicable Governmental Rules or any
applicable collective bargaining agreement, during the period commencing at
the Closing and ending on the date that is twelve (12) months from the
Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause the applicable Company Party to provide
Affected Employees with (i) base salary or wages substantially the same as
those in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) health and welfare
benefits (other than severance benefits) substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those offered by the applicable Company Party immediately prior
to the Closing.

  

(e) Nothing in this _Section_7.02 shall (i) confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, (ii) be deemed or
construed to require Buyer or any Company Party to continue to employ any
particular employee of any Company Party for any period following the Closing,
(iii) be deemed or construed to limit the right of Buyer or any Company Party
to terminate the employment of any Affected Employee during any period
following the Closing or (iv) establish, modify or amend any Plan.

  

7.03. _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) _Indemnification_. The Kohlberg Sellers, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees and hold them harmless from and against
(without duplication), any and all Taxes and Losses, to the extent that such
Taxes or Losses are not included in Final Working Capital, attributable to:
(i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of any Company Party or Blocker for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion
through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (each a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"); (ii) all
Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group
of which any Company Party or Blocker (or any predecessor of a Company Party
or Blocker) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar
state, local or non-U.S. Governmental Rule; and (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person (other than a Company Party or Blocker) imposed on a Company Party or
Blocker as a transferee or successor, by contract, or pursuant to any
Governmental Rule, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing.

  

(b) _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_. Sellers\'
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause
to be timely filed all Income Tax Returns for the Company Parties or Blockers
for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed
after the Closing Date in a manner consistent with past practice, and shall
provide copies of such Tax Returns to Buyer for review at least 15 days prior
to the filing date (after giving effect to any valid extensions). Sellers\'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) will timely pay the amount of all
Taxes set forth on such Tax Returns described in this _Section_7.03(b), less
the amount of any such Taxes that are included in the calculation of Final
Working Capital.

  

(c) _Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date_.

  

(i) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be
timely filed any Income Tax Returns of the Company Parties and Blockers for
Tax periods which begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date ("Straddle Period Tax Returns") and all Tax Returns for all Tax
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the
Closing Date other than Income Tax Returns ("Other Pre-Closing Tax Returns").

  

(ii) Buyer will submit any such Straddle Period Tax Returns or Other Pre-
Closing Tax Returns to the Sellers\' Representative for review and approval at
least 30 days prior to the filing date (after giving effect to any valid
extensions); provided, however, that if the time period for filing any such
Tax Return is less than 30 days after the end of the relevant taxable period,
including valid extensions (a "Short-Period Straddle or Other Return"), Buyer
shall submit such Tax Return to Sellers\' Representative within a time period
that provides Sellers\' Representative with a reasonable period of time to
review and comment on such Tax Return. Within 15 days after receipt of such
Tax Returns (or, with respect to any Short-Period Straddle or Other Return,
within a reasonable time period after Sellers\' Representative\'s receipt of
such Tax Return, taking into account the due date of such Short-Period
Straddle or Other Return), the Sellers\' Representative will give written
notice to Buyer of any dispute with respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer and the
Sellers\' Representative will promptly attempt to resolve any disputes with
respect to such Tax Returns; provided, that if they are unable to do so within
5 days after delivery of notice of the dispute, such disputed items will be
resolved by the CPA Firm. Sellers\' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
will pay to Buyer on or before the date which is the later of 10 days before
the due date of such Straddle Period Tax Return or Other Pre-Closing Tax
Return (after giving effect to any valid extensions), or five days after the
final resolution of any dispute, the amount of Taxes as set forth on such Tax
Return that are attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, less the amount of
any such Taxes that are included in the calculation of Final Working Capital.

  

(d) _Straddle Period / Allocation of Company Income_.

  

(i) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes of a Company Party
or Blocker based on or measured by income, receipts, sales, or payroll of a
Company Party or Blocker for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined
based on an interim closing of the books of the applicable Company Party or
Blocker as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which
the Company Party or Blocker holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to
terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of a Company Party or
Blocker for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
relevant Straddle Period from the beginning of such period up to and including
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
relevant Straddle Period.

  

(ii) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Governmental Rule, for
purposes of determining allocations of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit of the Company Parties on a pass-through basis ("Pass-Through
Allocations") the taxable year of the Company Parties shall be treated as
ending at the end of the day on the Closing Date. In any jurisdiction in which
a closing of the taxable year at the end of the Closing Date is not required
or permitted for purposes of determining Pass-Through Allocations, all items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Company Parties for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.
Sellers shall take into account for relevant Tax purposes and shall include on
their Tax Returns their allocable shares of Pass-Through Allocations
determined pursuant to this _Section_7.03(d)(ii) for the taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending at the end of the Closing Date.

  

(e) _Tax Controversies_. Unless Buyer has previously received written notice
from the Sellers\' Representative of the existence of any Tax Matter (as
defined below), Buyer shall notify the Sellers\' Representative of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Sellers may be liable under
this Agreement (such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a
"Tax Matter"); provided, however, that no failure to give such notice shall
relieve the Sellers of any liability hereunder except to the extent, if any,
that the rights of the Sellers with respect to such claim are materially
actually prejudiced thereby. The Sellers\' Representative shall have the
authority to represent the interests of a Company Party or Blocker and shall
have the right to control of the defense, compromise or other resolution of
any Tax Matter relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a
Straddle Period); provided, however, that Buyer shall be entitled to fully
participate in such Tax Matter at its own expense. Buyer shall have the
authority to represent the interests of a Company Party or Blocker and shall
have the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any
Tax Matter relating to a Straddle Period; _provided_ however, that, the
Sellers\' Representative shall be entitled to fully participate in such Tax
Matter at its own expense. Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably
informed, to the extent practicable, with respect to the commencement, status
and nature of any Tax Matter to which a party is entitled to control pursuant
to this Section. The Sellers\' Representative and Buyer shall not (and shall
not allow) the settlement of any Tax Matter it controls without the prior
written consent of Buyer or Sellers\' Representative, as the case may be, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event
that either Buyer or Sellers\' Representative does not assume representation
of a Company Party or Blocker in a Tax Matter that it is entitled to control
pursuant to this _Section_7.03(e), the other party may assume the control of
such Tax Matter; provided however, that such party may not settle (or allow
the settlement of) such Tax Matter without the prior written consent of the
other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. This Section shall control responsibility for Tax Matters
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary.

  

(f) _No Amendment of Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns_. Neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company Parties and
the Blockers) shall amend or refile any Tax Return of a Blocker or a Company
Party for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the
Sellers\' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

(g) _Refunds_. The Blocker Sellers shall be entitled to any credits and
refunds (including any interest thereon) received by a Blocker in respect of
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, solely to the extent that the amount of such
credit or refund (and any interest thereon) exceeds the amount reflected as an
asset with respect to such credit or refund on the statement of Final Working
Capital. Buyer agrees that, upon written request of Seller Representative and
at the sole cost and expense of Blocker Seller, it shall apply for any such
credit or refund and further agrees that it will not elect to (i) carry
forward any such credit or refund amount to reduce Taxes of a Blocker or
Company Party for any Tax period (or portion thereof) that begins after the
Closing Date; or (ii) carry forward any net operating losses from a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to a Tax period that begins on or after the Closing Date if
such net operating losses, credit or refund could be utilized to obtain a
refund for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall cause a Tax refund that is
recognized or received with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and which
Blocker Sellers are entitled pursuant to this _Section_7.03(g) to be paid to
the Sellers\' Representative (for distribution to the Blocker Sellers)
promptly after it is received. At the time that the Sellers\' Representative
files each Blocker\'s Income Tax Return pursuant to _Section_7.03(b), each
Blocker shall either (i) properly carry back any net operating loss from its
2013 tax year to offset income from its 2012 tax year; or (ii) properly elect
to relinquish the carry back period with respect to such net operating loss.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Blocker Sellers
shall not be entitled to any credit or refund relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the extent that such credit or refund relates to any net operating
loss or credit that is carried back to the Pre-Closing Tax Period from a
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or after the Closing Date, and
Blocker Sellers shall not be entitled to any payment with respect to the use
or application in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, subject to
the limitations provided in (i) and (ii) of this _Section_7.03(g), of a net
operating loss or credit that arises in a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  

(h) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company Parties, Blockers and
Sellers\' Representative shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include (i) the retention and (upon
the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding; (ii)
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; and
(iii) the execution and delivery of such powers or attorney and other
documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section_7.03(h).
Any information obtained under this _Section_7.03(h) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a Tax proceeding.

  

(i) _Access to Books and Records._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of Buyer, each Blocker and each Company Party shall (i)
use its reasonable best efforts to properly retain and maintain the Tax and
accounting records of the Company Parties and the Blockers that relate to Pre-
Closing Taxable Periods for five (5) years and shall thereafter provide the
Sellers\' Representative with written notice prior to any destruction,
abandonment or disposition of all or any portions of such records, (ii)
transfer such records to the Sellers\' Representative at the sole cost and
expense of Sellers\' Representative upon its written request prior to any such
destruction, abandonment or disposition and (iii) allow the Sellers\'
Representative and its Affiliates and their respective agents and
representatives, at times and dates reasonably and mutually acceptable to the
parties, to from time to time inspect and review such records solely relating
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period as the Sellers\' Representative may deem necessary
or appropriate in order to file any Tax Return or defend any Tax Matter
relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that in all
cases, such activities are to be conducted by the Sellers\' Representative
during normal business hours and at the Sellers\' sole expense. Any
information obtained under this _Section_7.03(i) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or in the conduct of a Tax proceeding.

  

(j) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, value added, transfer, stamp,
registration, documentary, excise, real property transfer, or similar Taxes
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred as a result of the sale and purchase
of Seller Interests pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne equally between
the Sellers (as one party) and Buyer (as one party). All costs and expenses
incurred with respect to the preparation and filing of any Tax Returns
relating to such Transfer Taxes shall be borne equally between the Sellers (as
one party) and Buyer (as one party). The Buyer, Sellers and Sellers\'
Representative shall each use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other in mitigating the amount of any such Transfer Taxes
and in the preparation, execution, and filing of all Tax Returns and other
documents required in connection with such Transfer Taxes.

  

(k) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Sellers shall cause all tax-sharing agreements
or similar agreements with respect to or involving any Company Party or
Blocker to be terminated as of the Closing and, Sellers shall ensure that
after the Closing, no Company Party or Blocker shall be bound thereby or have
any liability thereunder.

  

(l) _Section 754 Election_. In the event that Buyer reasonably determines that
an Income Tax Return is required to be filed with respect to the Company for a
taxable period ending on the Closing Date, the Company shall, at the written
direction of Buyer provided to the Sellers\' Representative no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of the
Company\'s federal income Tax Return for the Tax period ending on the Closing
Date (the "Section 754 Notice"), file its federal (and applicable state and
local) Income Tax Return so that an election under Section 754 of the Code
(and any corresponding provision of state and local income Tax law) (the
"Section 754 Election") is in effect with respect to the Company for the
taxable period that ends on the Closing Date. If Buyer timely provides the
Section 754 Notice to Sellers\' Representative, Buyer shall also prepare (or
may instruct the preparer of the Company\'s federal income Tax Return for the
Tax period ending on the Closing Date to prepare at Buyer\'s expense) all
documentation necessary to properly make the Section 754 Election, and the
Seller authorized to sign the federal income Tax Return of the Company shall
cooperate in good faith in any manner reasonably requested by Buyer. The
Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that Buyer, in its sole discretion,
shall be entitled to cause a Section 754 Election to be made with respect to
any Income Tax Return of the Company for a taxable period ending after the
Closing Date.

  

(m) _Entity Classification_. The Sellers shall not take or allow to be taken
any action that would result in a change in the entity classification of the
Company Parties set forth on _Schedule_4.07(t) of the Disclosure Schedule as
of the date of execution of this Agreement.

  

(n) _Withholding and Payroll Taxes on Compensatory Payments_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement ancillary to
this Agreement, to the extent that an amount is paid or is payable to an
Optionholder (or any other service provider of any Company Party or Blocker)
or to the Sellers\' Representative for the benefit of any Optionholder (or any
other service provider of any Company Party or Blocker) pursuant to this
Agreement or any other such ancillary agreement and such amount may be subject
to payroll and employment tax withholding under applicable law (e.g., such
amounts are payable by the Sellers\' Representative to an employee or former
employee of a Company Party or Blocker and those amount are treated as "wages"
under Code Sections 3121, 3306, or 3402), then, the Sellers\' Representative
shall deliver written notice to Buyer of the type and gross amount of each
such payment and the identity of the payee (a "Payment Notice") and shall
cause, to the extent that the amount of such payment, or any portion thereof,
has not been included in determining the amount of Company Transaction
Expenses or in determining Final Working Capital, the gross amount of such
payment to be delivered to an account or accounts of one or more of Buyer,
Company Party, or any Affiliate thereof as instructed by Buyer (or, if
applicable, direct Buyer to retain such amounts from payments otherwise due to
the Sellers\' Representative for purposes of making the payments contemplated
hereby) and, provided further, that the Sellers\' Representative (on behalf of
the Sellers) shall pay to Buyer, any Company Party, or any Affiliate thereof
(as instructed by Buyer) the amount of the employer\'s share of any employment
or payroll taxes incurred by or imposed upon any of them (the "Seller Payroll
Taxes") along with any additional payment necessary so that the net amount
retained by Buyer, the Company Party, or Affiliate (as the case may be) after
payment of all Tax resulting from the receipt of such payment and payments
described in this proviso is equal to the Seller Payroll Taxes, all as
reasonably calculated by Buyer. On the first payroll date that is at least
five (5) Business Days after its receipt of a Payment Notice and all amounts
due under this _Section_7.03(n) in respect of the payments contemplated
thereby, Buyer shall, or shall cause a Company Party or Affiliate to, make all
payments as directed in such Payment Notice through the applicable payroll
system of Buyer, Company Party, or Affiliate and make all applicable
employment and payroll tax withholding on such amounts in accordance with
applicable law. The sole obligation of Buyer and Company Parties with respect
to the payments contemplated by this _Section_7.03(n) is to deliver such
payments to the applicable payees (net of applicable Taxes) in accordance with
Payment Notices and no such Person will have any liability whatsoever to the
Sellers\' Representative, any Seller or any payee with respect to any payment
that is so delivered.

  

7.04. _Confidentiality; Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_.

  

(a) For the period set forth on _Schedule_7.04(a) from and after the Closing
Date the Sellers shall, and shall take all reasonable action to cause their
Affiliates and officers, directors, employees and advisors (collectively, the
"Representatives"), (i) not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal,
divulge or communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors
and employees of Buyer or Parent or use or otherwise exploit for its own
benefit or for the benefit of anyone other than Buyer or Parent, any
Confidential Information and (ii) to keep confidential any Confidential
Information relating primarily to the Business, except for any such
information that (A) is available to the public on the Closing Date, (B)
thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Sellers or any of its Representatives in breach of this
provision (other than pursuant to a legal obligation to do so or in connection
with the enforcement of its rights under this Agreement), or (C) is or becomes
available to the Sellers or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential
basis from a source that is not prohibited from disclosing such information to
such Representative by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to Buyer
or the Company; provided, that nothing contained in this _Section_7.04(a)
shall prohibit the Sellers from (i) disclosing information to its investors in
order to comply with such Seller\'s reporting obligations to such investors so
long as such investors agree to abide by the restrictions contained in this
_Section_7.04 or substantially similar confidentiality restrictions and (ii)
disclosing any information should the Sellers or any such Representative be
required to disclose any such information in response to a Governmental Order
or as otherwise required by Governmental Rule or administrative process;
provided, that in any such case described in clause (ii) of this sentence it
shall inform Buyer and Parent in writing of such request or obligation as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Sellers are informed of it and, if
reasonably practicable, before any information is disclosed, and Buyer or
Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy at Buyer\'s
sole cost and expense to prevent such disclosure. If a Seller or such
Representative is obligated to make such disclosure, it shall only make such
disclosure to the extent to which it is so obligated, but not further or
otherwise. For purposes of this _Section_7.04(a), "Confidential Information"
means any information relating primarily to the Business, including methods of
operation, customers, customer lists, products, prices, fees, discounts,
rebates, costs, technology, inventions, trade secrets, know-how, software,
marketing methods, plans, strategies (including specifically those related to
pricing, discounts and rebates) and information relating to the Business\'
personnel, suppliers, competitors, markets or other specialized information or
proprietary matters, in each case relating primarily to the Business.

  

(b) For the period set forth on _Schedule_7.04(b) from and after the Closing
Date, neither the Sellers (other than the Partners Group Sellers) nor any of
their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, own, invest in, lend to,
manage, consult to, work for, engage in, operate, control, maintain any
proprietary or financial interest in, or participate in the ownership,
management, operation or control of, any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, engaged in the manufacturing
and sale of caskets, urns and similar products on a wholesale basis to funeral
homes or distributors to funeral homes (the "Business") in North America.

  

(c) For the period set forth on _Schedule_7.04(c) from and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers (other than the Partners Group Sellers) shall not, and shall
cause each of their respective Affiliates and directors, managers, officers,
and employees to not, directly or indirectly on behalf of any other Person,
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employee of any Company Party to leave
his or her employment with such Company Party; provided, that nothing
contained in this _Section_7.04(c) shall prohibit the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates from soliciting any such individual in the event that (i) such
solicitation is a general solicitation for employment not otherwise aimed or
targeted at the employees of any Company Party or (ii) such individual was
terminated by a Company Party or any of its Affiliates.

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the case of breach of the
covenants in this _Section_7.04, (i) Buyer or Parent may seek specific
performance to cause the Sellers to cease such breach and refrain from any
such future breaches and (ii) the claiming of damages for any losses incurred
by Buyer or Parent due to actions prohibited by the aforesaid covenants shall
remain unaffected.

  

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this
_Section_7.04 are an essential element to this Agreement and that, but for
these covenants, the parties hereto would not have entered into this
Agreement. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that each
party has received adequate consideration in exchange for entering into these
covenants, the foregoing restrictions are reasonable and necessary to protect
the legitimate interest of Buyer and Parent post-Closing, including the
goodwill that Buyer shall be purchasing from the Sellers pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. The
parties hereto acknowledge that this _Section_7.04 constitutes an independent
covenant and shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any
other provisions of this Agreement or any other document contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

(f) It is the intention of the parties hereto that if any of the restrictions
or covenants contained in this _Section_7.04 is held to cover a geographic
area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by Governmental
Rule, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such
restrictions or covenants shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent such restrictions or covenants would be valid or
enforceable under applicable Governmental Rule, a court of competent
jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this _Section_7.04 to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained in this
_Section_7.04) that would be valid and enforceable under law.

  

7.05. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_. Recognizing that Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP ("Paul, Weiss") has acted as legal
counsel to Kohlberg Management VI, L.L.C. ("Kohlberg") and its Affiliates, and
may be deemed to have acted as legal counsel to the Company Parties prior to
the Closing, and that Paul, Weiss intends to act as legal counsel to Kohlberg
and its Affiliates after the Closing, (i) the Company hereby waives, on its
own behalf and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Paul, Weiss representing Kohlberg and its
Affiliates after the Closing, including in Kohlberg\'s or one of its
Affiliate\'s capacity as the Sellers\' Representative and (ii) the Company
hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises between or among any of
Parent, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) and Kohlberg or any of its
Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
each of the parties hereto agrees that Paul, Weiss may represent Kohlberg or
any of its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of Kohlberg or
such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or its
Subsidiaries), and even though Paul, Weiss may have represented the Company or
its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for Kohlberg. Parent, Buyer and the Company hereby
waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their respective Affiliates, any
conflict of interest in connection with such representation by Paul, Weiss.
Buyer and the Company further agree that, as to all communications among Paul,
Weiss, the Company and/or any Subsidiary, and all attorney work product that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to Kohlberg and may be controlled
by Kohlberg and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Buyer, the Company
or any Subsidiary. The parties hereto agree to take, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the intent of
this _Section _7.05. Parent and Buyer acknowledge that it and the Company have
had the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the
significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to,
the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the
opportunity to consult with counsel other than Paul, Weiss. This _Section
_7.05 is for the benefit of the Sellers\' Representative, its Affiliates, and
Paul, Weiss (including its partners and employees), each of which are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section _7.05.

  

ARTICLE VIII 
  _INDEMNIFICATION_

  

8.01. _Indemnification by the Sellers_ _and the Blocker Sellers_.

  

(a) After the Closing, the Kohlberg Sellers shall jointly and severally
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Parent, Buyer and the Company Parties,
Blockers and their respective equity holders, directors, officers and
employees, (each a "Seller Indemnitee") from and against, and shall pay and
reimburse each Seller Indemnitee the amount of, any and all claims (including
any investigation, suit, action or other proceeding, whether instituted by a
third party against a Seller Indemnitee or by a Seller Indemnitee for the
purpose of enforcing its rights hereunder), demands, judgments, fines,
damages, losses, Liabilities, costs, claims, fines, fees, penalties,
obligations, injuries and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
court costs) (individually, a "Loss" and collectively, "Losses"), without
duplication, that constitute, or arise out of or in connection with:

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company in _Article_IV
of this Agreement or any breach of any certification with respect to the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the certificate
delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section_6.01(i) _(iii)_ (a "Company Warranty
Breach");

  

(ii) any breach by the Company in the performance or observance of any of its
covenants or agreements to be performed hereunder prior to the Closing;

  

(iii) any Company Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses to the extent
not paid at Closing or included in Final Working Capital, Final Company
Indebtedness or Final Company Transaction Expenses;

  

(iv) any breach by the Sellers in the performance or observance of any of
their covenants in _Section 7.03_ ; and

  

(v) the matter set forth on _Schedule_8.01(a)(v).

  

(b) After the Closing, each Seller shall, severally and individually (and not
on behalf of any other Seller), defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against, and shall pay and reimburse each Seller
Indemnitee the amount of, any and all Losses, without duplication, that
constitute, or arise out of or in connection with:

  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of such Seller in _Article_II
or _Article_III of this Agreement or any breach of any certification with
respect to the representations and warranties of such Seller contained in the
certificate delivered to Buyer pursuant to _Section_6.01(i) _(iii)_ (a "Seller
Warranty Breach"); and

  

(ii) any breach by any such Seller in the performance or observance of any of
its covenants or agreements to be performed hereunder (other than
_Section_7.03).

  

8.02. _Indemnification by Buyer_. After the Closing, Buyer will defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their equity holders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, employees, agents representatives, attorneys, successors
and permitted assigns (each a "Buyer Indemnitee") from and against, and shall
pay and reimburse each Buyer Indemnitee the amount of, any and all Losses that
constitute, or arise out of or in connection with:

  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Buyer in this
Agreement or any breach of any certification with respect to the
representations and warranties of Parent or Buyer contained in the certificate
delivered to the Sellers\' Representative pursuant to _Section_6.02(d) (a
"Buyer Warranty Breach"); and

  

(b) any default by Parent or Buyer in the performance or observance of any of
its covenants or agreements to be performed hereunder.

  

8.03. _Notice and Satisfaction of Indemnification Claims_. No indemnification
claim will be deemed to have been asserted until the applicable Indemnitor
(which, in the case of the Kohlberg Sellers or Michael Quinn, shall be deemed
to be the Sellers\' Representative) has been given notice (which, in the case
of a Partners Group Seller, shall only be valid if delivered to the notice
party listed in Section 9.06) by the Indemnitee of, to the extent feasible,
the amount of Losses related to such claim and the facts on which such claim
is based, together with all reasonable supporting documentation for purposes
of understanding and verifying the nature of the claim and facts relating
thereto (a "Claim Notice"). For purposes of _Section _8.06, notice of an
indemnification claim will be deemed to cover claims arising out of all
related Proceedings based on the same facts and circumstances so long as, in
the case of Proceedings instituted by third parties, the Indemnitee complies
with _Section _8.05. If the Indemnitee is not Buyer or the Sellers, then such
notice will be given on behalf of such Indemnitee by Buyer or the Sellers\'
Representative, as applicable.

  

8.04. _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a) Other than in connection with a Third Party Claim, if any Seller
Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee (the "Indemnitees"), as the case may be,
delivers a Claim Notice to Buyer, a Partners Group Seller or the Sellers\'
Representative (in such case, an "Indemnitor"), as applicable, in accordance
with _Section_8.03 above, then this _Section_8.04 shall apply.

  

(b) For a period of thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of such Claim
Notice by the Indemnitor (the "Dispute Period"), the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to review the Claim Notice and the basis of the underlying claim. The
Indemnitor may, in good faith, dispute the amount of or basis for such claim
by providing a written notice of such dispute to the Indemnitees prior to the
expiration of the Dispute Period, with the basis for such dispute set forth in
reasonable detail (the "Dispute Notice"). If the Indemnitees receive a Dispute
Notice from the Indemnitor within the Dispute Period, the Indemnitor and the
Indemnitees shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such
dispute.

  

(c) If a Dispute Notice is received within the Dispute Period, the Indemnitees
and the Indemnitor shall attempt in good faith during the thirty (30) calendar
day period commencing after the receipt of such Dispute Notice ("Settlement
Period") to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each such claim. In the event of resolution of such dispute, the Indemnitees
and the Indemnitor shall collectively execute a memorandum setting forth such
resolution and, if applicable, the amount of any payments to be made to the
Indemnitees. If the Indemnitees and the Indemnitor are unable to resolve such
dispute within the Settlement Period, then the Indemnitees, on the one hand,
or the Indemnitor, on the other, may pursue its available remedies for
resolving the claim for indemnification.

  

8.05. _Third Party Claims_. If any suit, claim, investigation, action,
inquiry, charge, citation, arbitration, grievance or proceeding (each a
"Proceeding") is initiated against any Indemnitee by any third party and such
Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from an Indemnitor under this
_Article_VIII on account of its involvement in such Proceeding (a "Third Party
Claim"), then such Indemnitee will give prompt notice, but in no event more
than fifteen (15) calendar days following Buyer or Parent\'s knowledge of the
making of such claim, to the applicable Indemnitor of such Proceeding;
provided, that the failure to so notify such Indemnitor will not relieve such
Indemnitor of its obligations under this _Article_VIII (except to the extent
the defense of such claim is materially prejudiced by such failure), and will
reduce such obligations by the amount of damages or increased costs and
expenses attributable to such failure to give notice. Upon receipt of such
notice, if the third party claim would not reasonably be expected to exceed
the cap set forth in _Section_8.07(b), does not seek injunctive relief, such
Indemnitor shall have the option to assume the defense of such Proceeding on
behalf of such Indemnitee at the Indemnitor\'s own expense using counsel
reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee; provided, that if such Indemnitor
fails or refuses to conduct such defense, or such Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel that it may have defenses available to it which are different from
or in addition to those available to such Indemnitor, or that its interests in
such Proceeding are adverse to such Indemnitor\'s interests, then such
Indemnitee may defend against (but not settle) such Proceeding at such
Indemnitor\'s expense; provided, that in no event shall the Indemnitor be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnitees
as a group. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any third party claim,
the Indemnitee may participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of
such third party claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall control
the investigation, defense and settlement thereof. The Indemnitor shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any third party claim, unless such
settlement, compromise, discharge or entry of any judgment does not involve
any finding or admission of any violation of Governmental Rule or admission of
any wrongdoing by the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitor shall (i) pay or cause to
be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently
with the effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (unless otherwise
provided in such judgment), (ii) not encumber any of the material assets of
any Indemnitee or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially adversely affect any Indemnitee or the conduct of any Indemnitee\'s
business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement, compromise,
discharge, entry of judgment (if applicable), or other resolution, a complete
and unconditional release of each Indemnitee from any and all liabilities in
respect of such third party claim. Whether the Indemnitor assumes control of
the defense of a claim or not, the Indemnitee may not settle, compromise or
consent without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld) to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
third party claim. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_8.05 to the
contrary, no Indemnitor shall have the right to defend any third party claim
(but may participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such claim) if
such claim is a criminal claim and the Indemnitee may elect to assume the
defense of such claim and such reasonable expenses shall constitute Losses
payable to an Indemnitee as set forth in this _Article_VIII. Any Indemnitor
and Indemnitee will reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any
such Proceeding.

  

8.06. _Duration of Certain Indemnification Obligations_.

  

(a) Claims for indemnification under _Section_8.01 may only be asserted within
the following time periods and in accordance with the following terms and

_Section_8.01(a)(iii) may only be asserted for a period of thirty-six (36)
months after the Closing Date;

  

(iii) claims arising out of or in connection with (i) any Seller Warranty
Breach under _Section_3.08 (Tax Matters) or Company Warranty Breach under

(collectively, the "Tax Claims") and claims arising under
_Sections_8.01(a)(ii) and 8.01(b)(ii) with respect to covenants or obligations
to be performed or complied with after the Closing may be asserted at any time

limitations; and

  

(iv) all other claims for indemnification under _Section_8.01 may only be

(b) Claims for indemnification under _Sections_8.02(a) or 8.02(b) may only be
asserted for a period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date.

  

8.07. _Indemnification Threshold and Cap; Materiality Scrape; Limitation on
Losses_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Indemnitors will not have
any indemnification obligations under _Section _8.01(a)(i) or
_Section_8.01(b)(i) (exclusive of a Seller Warranty Breach involving any
Fundamental Seller Warranties or Company Warranty Breach involving any
Fundamental Company Warranties or any Tax Claim) unless (x) any individual
Loss or group or series of related Losses exceeds $100,000 (such Loss or group
or series of related Losses that does not exceed $100,000, the "DeMinimis
Losses"), and (y) the aggregate amount of such Losses that would otherwise be
payable under _Section _8.01(a)(i) and _Section_8.01(b) (which shall not
include for such purposes DeMinimis Losses) exceeds the amount set forth on
_Schedule_8.07(a) (the "Threshold Amount"), whereupon the Indemnitors will
only be liable for the amount of such Losses (which shall not include for such
purposes DeMinimis Losses) in excess of the Threshold Amount.

  

(b) 
 

  

(i) The Sellers\' aggregate indemnification obligations under _Section
_8.01(a)(i), _Section_8.01(a)(ii), _Section_8.01(a)(v) and _Section_8.01(b)
_(i)_ (exclusive of a Seller Warranty Breach involving any Fundamental Seller
Warranties, Company Warranty Breach involving any Fundamental Company
Warranties, or any Tax Claim) shall be capped at the amount set forth on
_Schedule_8.07(b) _(i)_ ; and

  

(ii) The Sellers\' aggregate indemnification obligations for any Tax Claim
related to a Company Party (exclusive of any Taxes required to be paid with
respect to a Company Party by Sellers pursuant to _Section 7.03(b)_ or
_Section 7.03(c)(ii_ ), any other Taxes related to a Company Party for which
the Kohlberg Sellers have an indemnification obligation under _Section
7.03(a)_ the original due date for payment of which is a date following the
Closing Date, any Pass-Through Taxes imposed on a Company Party, and for the
avoidance of doubt any Tax Claim related to a Blocker) shall be capped at the
amount set forth on _Schedule 8.07(b)(ii)_. The Sellers\' aggregate
indemnification obligations for all claims under this Agreement will be capped
at the Purchase Price, and for the avoidance of doubt, a Partners Group
Seller\'s aggregate indemnification obligations under _Section_8.01 shall be
capped at the amount of proceeds actually received by such Partners Group
Seller. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Losses arising from fraud or willful misconduct of the Sellers or the Company
shall not be subject to this Section 8.07(b) or any other limitation set forth
in this Agreement.

  

(c) Except for _Sections_4.06(a), 4.06(b) and 4.09(l), for purposes of
determining a Seller Warranty Breach, a Company Warranty Breach or a Buyer
Warranty Breach (including for purposes of the certifications delivered to
Buyer and Seller in respect of representations and warranties pursuant to
_Section_6.01(i) _(iii)_ and _Section_6.02(d)) under this Article VIII, and
calculating Losses under this Article VIII, any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties shall be
disregarded.

  

8.08. _Other Limitations on Indemnification Provisions_.

  

(a) Any payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee pursuant to this
_Article_VIII in respect of any claim will be reduced by any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnitee pursuant to any indemnification by or
indemnification agreement with any third party, net of all collection expenses
and of any portion of the Loss which was not indemnified hereunder as a result
of the limitations in _Section_8.07. In addition, to the extent that the
Indemnitee actually receives insurance proceeds as a result of any Losses for
which indemnification is claimed hereunder (which Indemnitee shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover), the Indemnitee shall pay the
amount of such insurance proceeds (but not in excess of the indemnification
payment or payments actually received) to the Indemnitor as and when such
insurance proceeds are actually received (net of any deductible paid by the
Indemnitee, recovery costs, including fees and expenses of counsel and
increased premiums and net of any portion of the Loss which was not
indemnified hereunder as a result of the limitations in _Section_8.07). The
amount of any Losses shall be reduced to take account of any net cash Tax
benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee in the taxable year in which such
Loss is incurred or paid arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Loss. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall not
be obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnitees hereunder from and against any
Losses to the extent that the same are included in Final Working Capital,
Final Company Indebtedness or Final Company Transaction Expenses.

  

(b) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of
any event which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any losses,
costs, expenses or damages that are or may be indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder.

  

8.09. _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except with respect to claims arising out of or resulting from fraud or
willful misconduct, in connection with a dispute under _Section_1.04 (which
shall be governed exclusively by _Section_1.04), and the right to seek
specific performance under _Section_9.15(a) in the case of a breach of a
covenant following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Article VIII
and _Section_7.03(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
hereto following the Closing for any and all claims arising under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach or
alleged breach of the provisions hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and
Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that all Losses of the Company Parties,
other than those for which a Seller Indemnitee recovers Losses in accordance
with Article VIII or _Section_7.03(a), shall be the sole responsibility of
Buyer, and after the Closing, the Company Parties.

  

8.10. _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments under this Article will be
treated by all parties, for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes, as adjustments to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
law, and the parties shall file their Tax Returns accordingly.

  

8.11. _Recoveries Under 2012 Merger Agreement_. After the Closing, if a Seller
Indemnitee suffers any Losses with respect to which the Sellers may be
obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article_VIII,
then, if there is a reasonable basis that the Parent Indemnified Parties (as
such term is defined in the 2012 Merger Agreement) should be indemnified for
such Losses pursuant to the 2012 Merger Agreement or Buyer has received
indemnification under _Section_8.01(a)(v), Buyer shall (without prejudice to
any other rights it may have hereunder) cause one or more of the Parent
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, to submit such claim for such Losses to
the Shareholders\' Agent (as such term is defined in the 2012 Merger
Agreement) and use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue the full amount
of such claims. For purposes of determining the amount of Losses subject to an
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article_VIII, the amount of such
Losses shall be reduced by the amount of any indemnity payments actually
received by the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to the 2012 Merger Agreement (net
of any fees, costs or expenses of recovery). If the Seller Indemnitees receive
an indemnification payment from the Sellers pursuant to this _Article_VIII (a
"Subject Payment") and the Parent Indemnified Parties later receive a payment
from the Company Shareholders (as such term is defined in the 2012 Merger
Agreement) pursuant to the 2012 Merger Agreement that has not already reduced
the amount of Losses otherwise payable by the Sellers pursuant to this
_Article_VIII, then Buyer shall pay to the Sellers\' Representative (for
further distribution among the Sellers and Optionholders in proportion to the
amount of the applicable Subject Payment actually paid by or on behalf of each
of them) an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount of the payment from
the Company Shareholders actually received by the Parent Indemnified Parties
(net of any fees, costs or expenses of recovery), and (y) the amount of the
Subject Payment previously paid by such Sellers in respect of such Losses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, and without
limitation of any rights and remedies provided by law, if the Sellers make an
indemnification payment under this _Article_VIII and the Parent Indemnified
Parties\' claim for such Losses under the 2012 Merger Agreement is denied in
whole or in part, Buyer shall assign (or cause to be assigned) such rights of
the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of such Losses to the Sellers\'
Representative who shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of the
Parent Indemnified Parties or any successors thereof, up to the amount of all
payments in respect of the indemnification obligations set forth in this
_Article_VIII; provided, that if such assignment is prohibited, Buyer shall
cooperate with the Sellers\' Representative to pursue such claim under the
2012 Merger Agreement at the sole costs and expense of the Sellers. Following
the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Parent Indemnified Parties
not to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction) any
term of the 2012 Merger Agreement in any manner that would modify or limit the
coverage or amounts available for such Losses or that otherwise adversely
affect the rights or recovery of the Parent Indemnified Parties thereunder.

  

ARTICLE IX 
  _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

  

9.01. _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
right, interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned, pledged or otherwise
transferred by any party, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without
the prior written consent of the other party or parties, and any such
attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be void;
provided that Buyer or Parent may assign all or any portion of this Agreement
to (a) any Affiliate without the consent of any other party hereto, (b) any

9.07. _Publicity_. None of Parent, Buyer, the Sellers or the Company shall
issue any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written
approval of the other parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

  

9.08. _Disclosure Schedules_.

  

(a) Each Disclosure Schedule delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been disclosed for all purposes of this
Agreement and qualify every representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement in respect of which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably
apparent on its face. Disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules
shall not constitute an expression of a view that such matter is material or
is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(b) To the extent that any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement is qualified by the materiality of the matter(s) to which the
representation or warranty relates, the inclusion of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedules does not constitute a determination by the Sellers that
any such matter is material. The disclosure of any information concerning a
matter in the Disclosure Schedules does not imply that any other, undisclosed
matter has a greater significance or value or is material.

  

(c) Each party hereto shall give prompt written notice to the other parties of
any written notice from any Governmental Authority affecting such party\'s
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

9.09. _No Amendment to Plans_. No provision in this Agreement shall (i)
constitute or be deemed to be a modification or amendment to any Plan or any
other employee benefit agreement, plan, program, or document or (ii) prevent
the amendment or termination of any Plan or any other employee benefit
agreement, plan, program, or document. This Agreement shall not prevent the
parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in
this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision
in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to a Plan or another
agreement. If a person not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit
or other action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to
a Plan or another agreement, and that provision is construed to be such an
amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having
any amendatory effect.

  

9.10. _Termination_.

  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

  

(i) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative;

  

(ii) by Buyer, upon written notice to the Sellers\' Representative, if there
has been a breach by the Sellers or the Company of any of such party\'s
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein, which is not cured
within the earlier of the Outside Date and twenty (20) days after written
notice thereof from Buyer to the Sellers\' Representative, which would result
in any of the conditions specified in _Section_6.01 not being fulfilled at the
Closing and such condition has not been waived in writing by Buyer; provided
that Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section_9.10(a)(ii) if there has been a breach by Parent or Buyer of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which result in any of the closing conditions set forth in _Section_6.02 not
being satisfied;

  

(iii) by the Sellers\' Representative, upon written notice to Buyer, if there
has been a breach by Parent or Buyer of any of their respective
representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein, which is not cured
within the earlier of the Outside Date and twenty (20) days after written
notice thereof from the Sellers\' Representative to Buyer, which would result
in any of the conditions specified in _Section_6.02 not being fulfilled at the
Closing and such condition has not been waived in writing by the Sellers\'
Representative; provided that the Sellers\' Representative shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_9.10(a)(iii) if
there has been a breach by the Sellers of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which result in any of
the closing conditions set forth in _Section_6.01 not being satisfied;

  

(iv) by either the Sellers\' Representative or Buyer if the Closing has not
occurred prior to December 9, 2016 (the "Outside Date"), or such later date,
if any, as Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative agree upon in writing;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
subsection shall not be available to any party whose breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;
or

  

(v) by either the Sellers\' Representative or Buyer, if any Governmental
Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order that restrains, prohibits or
invalidates the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and nonappealable.

  

(b) Except as set forth below, if this Agreement is terminated by either the
Sellers\' Representative or Buyer as provided above, then no party will have
any further obligations or liabilities hereunder except for obligations or
liabilities arising from a breach of this Agreement prior to such termination
or which survive such termination by their own terms. If (i) this Agreement is
terminated (A) by Buyer or the Sellers\' Representative pursuant to
_Section_9.10(a)(v) due to a Governmental Order related to the HSR Act or
other Competition Laws, (B) by Buyer or the Sellers\' Representative pursuant
to _Section_9.10(a)(iv) and at such time the conditions set forth in
_Section_6.02(b) (HSR Act; Governmental Approval) have not been satisfied, or
(C) by the Sellers\' Representative pursuant to _Section_9.10(a)(iii) due to
Buyer\'s breach of their respective obligations under _Sections_6.06 and 6.07;
and (ii) the Company Parties and the Sellers have performed in all material
respects their obligations under _Sections_6.06 and 6.07, then Buyer and
Parent shall be jointly and severally liable to pay to the Company a
termination fee equal to ten million dollars ($10,000,000) (the "Reverse
Termination Fee") on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day following such
termination by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing to Buyer by the Company no later than two (2) Business
Days after such termination. The Company and the Sellers agree that, other
than claims of and causes of action arising from fraud or willful misconduct,
in the event that the Reverse Termination Fee is paid to pursuant to this
_Section_9.10(b), the payment of such Reverse Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers and their Affiliates against Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, and, other than claims of and causes of action arising from
fraud or willful misconduct, in no event will Sellers, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates be entitled to recover any other money damages or
any other remedy, whether in law or equity or any other type, with respect to
(A) any Loss suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to be
consummated and (B) the termination of this Agreement. For all purposes of
this Agreement, "willful misconduct" shall mean a conscious, voluntary act or
omission taken with intentional disregard of legal or contractual duty and
knowledge that such action or omission is a breach of such legal or
contractual duty, including in respect of _Section_6.07 hereof.

  

9.11. _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement: (a) may be amended only by a writing
signed by each of the parties; (b) may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which is deemed an original but all of which constitute one and the
same instrument, and delivery of an executed counterpart by fax, pdf or other
electronic means shall be equally effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement; (c) together with the other Transaction
Documents, contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersedes all prior written
and oral agreements, and all contemporaneous oral agreements, relating to such
transactions; and (d) when referencing "$" or "dollars" refers to U.S.
dollars. The due performance or observance by a party of any of its
obligations under this Agreement may be waived only by a writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought, and any such waiver
will be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
The waiver by a party of any breach or violation of any provision of this
Agreement will not operate as, or be construed to be, a waiver of any
subsequent breach or violation hereof. Any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining portions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or provision is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify the Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Headings are for reference only and
shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement. The word "including" or
any variation thereof means "including, without limitation," and shall not be
construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or
similar items or matters immediately following it. References herein to any
contract or agreement (including this Agreement) mean such contract or
agreement as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof. References herein to any Governmental Rule mean such
Governmental Rule as amended, modified, codified, reenacted, supplemented or
superseded in whole or in part, and in effect from time to time. In the event
of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the
exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth
as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this
Agreement will control. Parent and Buyer hereby agree that Parent and Buyer
are jointly and severally liable for all obligations of each of Parent and
Buyer under this Agreement.

  

9.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim or controversy hereunder
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Governmental Rules
of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the principles of conflict
of laws thereof.

  

9.13. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Each of the parties
hereto (i) irrevocably agrees that all Proceedings (whether in contract or
tort, at law or in equity or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out
of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) shall be
exclusively resolved in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) irrevocably agrees service of
process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at
their respective addresses provided in _Section _9.06 (Notices) shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court, and (iii) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Governmental Rule, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action, suit or proceeding in any such
court. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that a final judgment in any
action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Governmental Rule.

  

9.14. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL RULE, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

  

9.15. _Specific Performance_.

  

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in
accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that each
party hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof
and to enforce the specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Sellers, the Sellers\'
Representative and the Company may institute or prosecute a Proceeding to
enforce specific performance of the Closing under this Agreement, and (ii)
Buyer or Parent may institute or prosecute a Proceeding to enforce specific
performance of Sellers\' obligation to sell the Seller Interests owned by the
Sellers to Buyer. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

  

(b) To the extent any party hereto brings any Proceeding to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount
of time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business
Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over
such Proceeding.

  

9.16. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as may otherwise be expressly set
forth in this Agreement, nothing herein express or implied is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.
