RECITALS

 

A. The Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Sub and Company believe it is in

B. Pursuant to the Merger and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, among other things, all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein.

C. Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Sub, on the other hand, desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in
connection with the Merger.

 

D. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a material
inducement to Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, all of the
Selected Key Employees are entering into a Restrictive Covenant Agreement,
each in substantially the form attached hereto as _E XHIBIT A_ (the "
_Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ "), with Parent and Company.

E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement as a material
inducement to Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, all of the Key

_Employment Agreements_ ").

 

F. The parties hereto intend to execute this Agreement under seal.

 

G. _A PPENDIX I_ of this Agreement contains definitions for certain defined
terms used in this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _Delaware Law_ "), Sub shall be
merged with and into Company, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall
cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The surviving corporation after the Merger
is sometimes referred to hereinafter as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 



-1- 1.2 _Effective Time_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1 hereof, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place on the later of (a) February 2, 2016 and (b) the fifth (5th)
Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII hereof (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 2000
University Avenue, East Palo Alto, California, unless another time or place is
mutually agreed upon in Writing by Parent and Company; provided, further,
that in no event shall the Closing be required to occur during the last two
calendar weeks of any fiscal quarter of Parent. The date upon which the
Closing actually occurs shall be referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."
On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as _E XHIBIT C_ with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law (the time of the acceptance of such filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware shall be referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. __

 

(a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated as of the Effective Time to be identical to the certificate of
incorporation of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
such certificate of incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the
Effective Time, Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as
follows: "The name of the corporation is SolidFire, Inc."

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until
thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. __

 

(a) _Directors of Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director of
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware
Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified.

(b)  _Officers of Surviving Corporation_. Unless otherwise determined by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the officers of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with
the provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



-2- 1.6 _Effect of Merger on the Securities of the Constituent Corporations_. __

(a) _Effect on Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, Company or the Company
Stockholders, each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, Company RSUs, Company Unvested Common Stock, Company
Options and Company Warrants unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Section 1.8, will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted
automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares of Company Capital Stock in the manner provided in
Section 1.11, an amount equal to (i) the Per Share Common Amount, _plus_ ,
(ii) the Post-Closing Payments, if any, attributable to such share, as set
forth in the Closing Allocation Schedule, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Each share of Company Capital Stock that is owned by Company as
treasury stock shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of
Company Unvested Common Stock that does not otherwise vest under the terms of
an agreement existing as of the date hereof shall be cancelled and
extinguished without consideration. For purposes of calculating the amount of
cash payable, if any, to each Company Stockholder pursuant to this section,
all shares of Company Capital Stock held by each Company Stockholder shall be
aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis. The amount of cash payable,
if any, to each Company Stockholder for each share certificate held shall be
rounded down to the nearest cent. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this
section, any Dissenting Shares will be treated as set forth in Section 1.9.

(b)  _Effect on Company Options; Company Warrants; Company Restricted Stock
Units_.

(i) _Vested Options_. Each vested outstanding Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Cashed-Out
Options_ ") shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration after
which it shall be cancelled and extinguished. If the Per Share Conversion
Common Amount does not exceed the per share exercise price of each such
outstanding Company Option, then such Company Option shall be cancelled
and extinguished, with no consideration payable in connection with such
cancellation and no further rights to the holder thereof (the " _Cancelled
Options_ ") and such Company Option shall not be deemed a Cashed-Out Option.
Company shall take any and all necessary action to provide for the
cancellation of each Company Option in accordance with this Section 1.6(b)(i).
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, through its
payroll system on a special payroll run on the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall or shall direct its payroll agent to, in accordance with its
customary payroll practices, pay to each holder of a Cashed-Out Option that
was granted to the holder in the holders capacity as an employee of Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for applicable employment Tax purposes (" _Employee
Cashed-Out Option Holder_ ") the applicable portion of the Option
Consideration (subject to applicable withholding Taxes) payable in respect of
each such Cashed-Out Option (" _Employee Option Consideration_ "); _provided,
that_ , if any such Employee Cashed-Out Holder has not executed and delivered
to Parent a Cashed-Out Option Agreement (a " _Cashed-Out Option Agreement_ ")
in substantially the form attached hereto as _E XHIBIT I_, as of such date,
the payment to such Employee Cashed-Out Option Holder shall be made as soon as
reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery to Parent of a
Cashed-Out Option Agreement. Each holder of a Cashed-Out Option that was
granted to the holder in the holders capacity as a non-employee service
provider to Company or any of its Subsidiaries for applicable employment Tax
purposes (" _Non-Employee Cashed-Out Option Holder_ ") shall be paid the
applicable portion of the Option Consideration by the Exchange Agent in the
manner provided in Section 1.11. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Option Consideration payable with respect to any Cashed-Out Options. In no
event shall any Cashed-Out Option or Cancelled Option be assumed by Parent.

 



-3- (ii) _Unvested Options_. Each unvested outstanding Company Option held by a
Continuing Employee (each an " _Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be assumed
by Parent (the " _Assumed Options_ ") and will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Unvested Company Option documents (including any applicable
Company Option Plan and stock option agreement or other document evidencing
such Unvested Company Option, including but not limited to any employment or
other agreement providing for accelerated vesting or other terms governing
such Assumed Options) immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each such Unvested
Company Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Conversion Rate (rounded down to the next whole number of
shares of Parent Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share
eliminated by such rounding), and (ii) the per share exercise price for
the shares of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Unvested
Company Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Unvested
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Conversion Rate, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The assumption and
conversion of Unvested Company Options by Parent are intended to satisfy the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.424-1 (to the extent such
options were incentive stock options) and of Treasury Regulations Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D). Following the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
Parent or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and
responsibility of the Board of Directors of Company or any committee thereof
with respect to each Assumed Option and references to Company shall become
references to Parent under the applicable Company Option Plan and stock
option agreement or other document evidencing such Assumed Option. Each
unvested outstanding Company Option that is not an Unvested Company Option
shall be treated as a Cancelled Option and shall be cancelled and
extinguished, with no consideration payable in connection with such
cancellation and no further rights to the holder thereof, at the Effective
Time.

(iii) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, the vested portion of each
Company Warrant that is outstanding and not exercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Cashed-Out Warrants_ ") shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Warrant Consideration, and each such Company Warrant shall be cancelled
and extinguished as of the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any
unvested portion of a Cashed-Out Warrant shall be cancelled and extinguished
and shall not be converted into the right to receive any consideration. For
the sake of clarity, if the Per Share Conversion Common Amount does not exceed
the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant, such Company Warrant
shall be deemed cancelled and extinguished. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Warrant Consideration payable with respect to any Company Warrant.
In no event shall any Company Warrant be assumed by Parent.

 

(iv) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. Each Company RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into restricted stock units covering Parent Stock, without any
further action required (the " _Assumed Company RSUs_ "). Each Assumed Company
RSU shall be subject to the same terms, including vesting arrangements that
were applicable to such Company RSUs immediately prior to, or at the Effective
Time, and no vesting acceleration of the Assumed Company RSUs shall occur
solely by reason of the Merger. Each such Assumed Company RSU shall be
exercisable for that number of whole shares of Parent Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Stock, with
no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
settlement of such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (B) the Conversion Rate. The assumption and conversion of
Company RSUs by Parent are intended to satisfy the requirements of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D).

 



-4- (c) _Withholding Taxes_. Company, the Depository Agent, the Exchange Agent,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amount payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any current or former Company Holder or to any other Person such amounts as
may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Entity or other appropriate Person, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(d) _Stockholder Loans_. In the event that any Company Holder is indebted to
Company as of the Effective Time, the amount of Initial Merger Consideration
payable to such Company Holder pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be reduced
by an amount equal to the outstanding principal plus accrued interest of such
Company Holders indebtedness to Company (the aggregate amount of all such
loans, referred to herein as the " _Stockholder Loans_ ") as of the Effective
Time. Such loans shall be satisfied as to the amount by which the
consideration is reduced pursuant to this Section 1.6(d).

(e) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each share of common stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

1.7 _Closing Statement; Post-Closing Adjustments_. __

(a) Company shall prepare and, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, deliver to Parent a closing statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
certified by Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
which shall include (i) a schedule of the applicable payment(s) to each
Person receiving payments pursuant to Section 1.10, including wire
instructions for each payment pursuant to Sections 1.10(b) and 1.10(c) and the
calculation of the Initial Merger Consideration; (ii) a statement of
the Estimated Cash, Estimated Third Party Expenses and the Estimated
Indebtedness of Company; and (iii) the Closing Allocation Schedule to be
delivered in accordance with Section 5.12. The Closing Statement shall be
prepared by Company in good faith, using reasonable diligence and in
accordance with terms of this Agreement. The Closing Statement shall be
subject to Parents review and consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided that_ any such consent shall not
preclude or otherwise impair or limit Parents ability to prepare and deliver
the Post-Closing Statement or dispute any amounts in the Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 1.7(b).

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no event
more than ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, Parent, at its
sole cost and expense, shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholder
Representative a statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_") setting forth
Parents good faith determination of the (i) Cash of Company as of the
Closing, (ii) Indebtedness of Company as of the Closing and (iii) Third Party
Expenses.

 

(c) Following receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days (the " _First
Review Period_ ") to review the Post-Closing Statement. During the First
Review Period (and during any time up through the Final Determination Date),
the Stockholder Representative and its accountants, and their respective
Representatives, shall be entitled to review the Post-Closing Statement and
shall have reasonable access during regular business hours to the personnel,
books and records and calculations of Company and Parent used in the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement. At or prior to the end of the
First Review Period, the Stockholder Representative will either (i) accept the
Post-Closing Statement in its entirety, in which case the final, binding Cash
as of the Closing, Indebtedness as of the Closing and Third Party Expenses
will each be as set forth in the Post-Closing Statement, or (ii) deliver to
Parent a Written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") containing a Written
explanation of those items that the Stockholder Representative disputes.

 



-5- (d) In the event the Stockholder Representative delivers an Objection Notice
to Parent within the First Review Period, within a further period of thirty
(30) calendar days from the end of the First Review Period, the parties and,
if desired, their accountants will attempt to resolve in good faith any
disputed items and reach a Written agreement with respect thereto (a "
_Settlement Agreement_ "). In the event the parties do not execute and deliver
a Settlement Agreement in the applicable time period, or execute and deliver a
Settlement Agreement only in relation to certain, but not all, disputed
items, the unresolved disputed items will be referred for final binding
resolution to Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Arbitrating Accountants_ "), which
Arbitrating Accountants shall be engaged by the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to a standard engagement letter, with each
of Parent and the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company
Holders) responsible for fifty percent (50%) of any upfront payables under
this Section 1.7(d) (the " _Upfront Expenses_ ").

(e) The disputed items submitted to the Arbitrating Accountants pursuant to
Section 1.7(d) above will be as determined by the Arbitrating Accountants in
the same manner prescribed for the preparation of the Closing Statement and
the Post-Closing Statement. The Arbitrating Accountants shall address only
those items in dispute and may not assign a value greater than the greatest
value claimed by Parent or the Stockholder Representative for such item or
smaller than the smallest value claimed by Parent or the Stockholder
Representative for such item in the Written reports submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountants pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Such determination shall
be (i) in Writing and include the resulting revised Post-Closing Statement
and the resulting allocation of fees and expenses of the Arbitrating
Accountants provided by Section 1.7(f), (ii) furnished to the Stockholder
Representative and Parent as soon as practicable after the items in dispute
have been referred to the Arbitrating Accountants, which the parties shall
request shall not be later than thirty (30) days thereafter, and (iii) an
arbitral award that is final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
of determining any Upward Adjustment Amount or Closing Deficiency and may be
entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

(f) If the Arbitrating Accountants resolve all disputes presented to them
entirely in the manner proposed by Parent or the Stockholder Representative,
as the case may be, the fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants
relating to the resolution of such dispute shall be paid by the other party.
In all other events, the fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants
shall be shared by the Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf of the
Company Holders), on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the Stockholder Representatives position, on the one hand,
and Parents position, on the other hand, initially presented to the
Arbitrating Accountants, based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a
whole, bear to the final resolution as determined by the Arbitrating
Accountants (and subject to a true-up to account for any Upfront Expenses
paid by either party). Any amounts payable to the Arbitrating Accountants as a
result of indemnification claims by the Arbitrating Accountants shall be
shared one half by the Stockholder Representative solely on behalf of the
Company Holders, on the one hand, and one half by Parent, on the other hand.

(g) _Adjustment_.

 

(i) If the Adjusted Merger Consideration exceeds the Initial Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_ "), then Parent
shall promptly deliver to (A) the Depository Agent, for benefit of and prompt
payment to the Company Holders (other than Employee Cashed-Out Option
Holders), an amount equal to the portion of the Upward Adjustment Amount
payable to such Company Holders and (B) the Surviving Corporation for payment
to Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders through the Surviving Corporations
payroll system, in accordance with its 

 



-6-  customary payroll practices, an amount equal to the portion of the Upward
Adjustment Amount (subject to applicable withholding Taxes) payable to such
Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders as specified in the Closing Allocation
Schedule.

(ii) If the Initial Merger Consideration exceeds the Adjusted Merger
Consideration (such excess, the " _Closing Deficiency_ "), then Parent is
hereby authorized to direct the Escrow Agent to immediately disburse the
amount of such difference from the Escrow Account. Any adjustment required by
this Section 1.7 shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Initial Merger
Consideration paid hereunder.

(iii) Any payment required by this Section 1.7(g) shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration paid hereunder.

1.8  _Escrow_. Citibank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") shall serve as escrow
agent under the Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as _E XHIBIT D_
(the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Amount shall be held as a trust fund
and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed
solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The terms and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the
Indemnifying Parties, Stockholder Consent and the Joinder Agreements shall
constitute approval by such Indemnifying Parties, as specific terms of the
Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of such Indemnifying Parties to be
bound by and comply with, the Escrow Agreement.

1.9 _Appraisal Rights_. __

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, but the holder thereof shall only be
entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.9(a) hereof, if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, as
applicable, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the applicable consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.6 hereof, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

 

(c) Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any Written demand for
appraisal received by Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Company shall not, except with the
prior Written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
such demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Parent shall
approve, in advance, any communication to be made by Company to any Company
Stockholder with respect to such demands. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to
the extent that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Company (A) makes any
payment or payments in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement or (B) incurs any other costs or expenses,
(including specifically, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding or in
connection with any investigation) in respect of any Dissenting Shares
(excluding payments for such shares) (to the extent remaining payable as of

Allocation Schedule.

 



-8- (ii) After receipt of such Letter of Transmittal, (A) the Company Stockholders
will surrender the certificates representing their shares of Company Capital

Warrants will surrender each agreement representing any Cashed-Out Warrant

and the Letter of Transmittal pursuant hereto.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant

or Cashed-Out Warrants_. The cash amounts paid in respect of the surrender

this Agreement.

4.2 _No Solicitation_. 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Company shall not, nor shall Company permit
any of its officers, directors, employees, Representatives or Affiliates to,

capital stock of any Subsidiary (whether or not outstanding) (excluding in

license or otherwise, or effect or agree to effect any such transaction (an "
_Acquisition Proposal_ "), (B) disclose any information not customarily

cease and cause to be terminated any such negotiations, discussion or

(B), (C) or (D) above. In the event that Company or any of Companys
Affiliates receives during the Pre-Closing Period, any offer, proposal, or
request of the type referenced in clause (A), (C), or (D) above, or any
request for disclosure or access as referenced in clause (B) above,

 



-39-  Company shall immediately (x) suspend any discussions with such offeror or
party with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y) within
twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent thereof, including information as to
the identity of the offeror or the party making any such offer or proposal and
the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as the case may be, and such
other information related thereto as Parent may reasonably request and (z)
provide Parent with a copy of any Written proposal or materials related to any
such Acquisition Proposal or request for information or inquiry; _provided,
however_ , that the identity of the offeror or the party making any such
offer or proposal and the specific terms of such offer or proposal, as the
case may be, and such other information related thereto need not be disclosed
if doing so is prohibited by the terms of any non-disclosure agreement in
effect as of the date hereof.

(b) Promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, after the
execution of this Agreement, Company shall, to the extent it has not done so
prior to the execution of this Agreement, send to other Persons to whom
confidential information was provided in connection with or with respect to
any potential sale of or any other potential business combination involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries "return or destroy" notices in respect of
such information.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders via the Requisite Stockholder Approval, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent Company from furnishing information to, or engaging
in negotiations or discussions with, any Person in connection with an
unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal by such Person, if and to the
extent that (i) Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, and Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel), in the exercise of its
fiduciary duties, that to do otherwise would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duty to the Company Stockholders, (ii) prior to furnishing such
information to, or engaging in negotiations or discussions with, such
Person, Companys Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement (A) with terms no more favorable to such Person than
those set forth in the non-disclosure agreement entered into with Parent and
(B) under which Company is permitted to share terms of any Acquisition
Proposal with Parent, (iii) Company gives Parent prompt, at least five (5)
Business Days (the " _Notice Period_ "), Written notice of its intention to
take such action with respect to the Superior Proposal and attaches to such
notice the most current version of the proposed agreement (which version shall
be updated on a prompt basis) and the identity of the third party making such
Superior Proposal, (iv) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to, during the
Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion,
proposes to make such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that,
after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to
the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three (3)
Business Days remains in the Notice Period subsequent to the time Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision (it being understood that there
may be multiple extensions)), and (v) Companys Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking
into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Notice Period in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Acquisition Proposal made by a third
party to acquire all of the equity securities of Company or the consolidated
total assets of Company, pursuant to a stock purchase, a merger, a
consolidation or a sale of its assets, (X) on terms that Companys Board of
Directors determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its
financial advisor) to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to
the Company Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement in accordance with Article IX  

 



-40-  hereof) and (Y) that is subject to no financing condition and is made by a
Person who Companys Board of Directors has reasonably concluded in good faith
will have adequate sources of financing to consummate such Superior Proposal,
taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal.

 

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 4.2 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.2 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that for purposes of this Section
4.2(d) any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any officer,
director, Representative or Affiliate of Company shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by Company.

 

4.3 _Procedures for Requesting Parent Consent_. If Company desires to take an
action which would be prohibited pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement
without the Written consent of Parent, prior to taking such action Company may
request such Written consent by sending an e-mail or facsimile to each of:

Consent_ "), and adoption as provided by Delaware Law and the
Charter Documents to Company Stockholders holding (i) a majority of the
outstanding Company Capital Stock and (ii) a majority of the outstanding
Company Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-if-
converted to Company Common Stock basis (such approval, the " _Requisite
Stockholder Approval_ "). Such submission, and any proxy or consent in
connection therewith shall specify that adoption of this

 



-41-  Agreement shall constitute approval by the Company Stockholders of: (A) the
Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement
relating thereto, including, the deposit of the Escrow Amount into the Escrow
Account (B) the deposit of the Stockholder Representative Fund Amount with the
Stockholder Representative, (C) the indemnification obligations of the Company
Stockholders set forth in Article VIII hereof, (D) the appointment of

Section 262 of Delaware Law, with respect thereto.

(b) Any materials to be submitted to the Stockholders in connection with the
solicitation of their approval of the Merger and this Agreement (the "
_Soliciting Materials_ ") shall have been previously made available with
reasonable time for review and reasonable approval by Parent. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Company shall not include in the
Soliciting Materials any information with respect to Parent or its Affiliates
or associates, the form and content of which shall not have been consented to
in Writing by Parent prior to such inclusion.

(c) Promptly following receipt of written consents of the Company Stockholders
constituting the Requisite Stockholder Approval, Company shall deliver notice
of the approval of the Merger by written consent of the Company Stockholders,
pursuant to and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date), Company shall submit
to the Company Stockholders, for approval by the Company Stockholders holding
the number of shares of stock required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)
of the Code, or any successor provisions, a written consent in favor of a
proposal to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G
inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to
Company Employee Plans or other plans, programs, arrangements or Contracts of
Company and its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the
provision of any benefit that causes the payments and/or benefits to not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G or that would reasonably be expected to
be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor
provisions (together, the " _Section 280G Payments_ "); provided that Parent
provides to Company, no later than thirteen (13) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, all information related to any increases in compensation to be
provided by Parent and any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing to the
individuals who are eligible to receive such Section 280G Payments, including
but not limited to the amount of the Company RSUs, necessary to complete
Companys analysis regarding the application of Section 280G to such Section
280G Payments. Such Company Stockholder approval and consent materials shall
be subject to prior review by Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any such Company Stockholder approval shall
be sought by Company in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements
of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, or any successor provisions, and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such
Treasury Regulations. Company agrees that: (i) in the absence of such Company
Stockholder approval, no Section 280G Payments shall be made; and (ii)
promptly after the date hereof (but in no event later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date), Company shall deliver to Parent a waiver,
in a form substantially similar to the form attached hereto as _E XHIBIT G_
(each a " _280G Waiver_ "), of the right to receive Section 280G Payments duly
executed by each Person who Company reasonably expects may receive any
Section 280G Payment(s) and provide copies of any such executed 280G Waivers
to Parent.

(e) The Board of Directors of Company shall not revoke its unanimous approval
of this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation its unanimous recommendation to the Company
Stockholders to vote in favor of this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the receipt and acceptance of a
Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 4.2(c) hereto.

 



-42- (f) Concurrent with the delivery of the Stockholder Consent and as a material
inducement to Parent and Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain Persons
set forth on _S CHEDULE 7.2(g)_ of this Agreement are executing and delivering
a Consent, Release and Representative Agreement in the form attached hereto
as  _E XHIBIT B_ (collectively, the " _Joinder Agreement_ ").

5.2 _Notice to Holders of Company Options and Company Warrants_. No later
than January 8, 2016, Company shall deliver notice to the holders of Company
Options and Company Warrants, which notice shall be in compliance with the
terms of such Company Options and Company Warrants, that such Company Options
and Company Warrants, respectively, will be cancelled, exercised, terminated,
assumed or released, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 1.6 hereof. Any materials to be submitted to the
holders of Company Options and Company Warrants in connection with the notice
required under this Section 5.2 shall be subject to reasonable review and
approval by Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

5.3 _Access to Information_. Company shall afford Parent and
its Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during
the Pre-Closing Period to (a) all of the properties, books, Contracts,
commitments and records of Company, (b) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by
applicable Law) of Company as Parent may reasonably request, (c) delivery of
Month-End Financials as soon as practicable after the end of each month, but
no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month, (d) delivery
of Year-End Financials as soon as practicable after the end of each year, but
no later than the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the following year, and (e) all
employees of Company as identified by Parent. Company agrees to provide to
Parent and its Representatives copies of internal financial statements
(including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.3 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof.

5.4 _Confidentiality_. Each of Parent, Sub and Company hereby agrees that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 5.3 hereof, or
pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated as of September 16,
2015 (the " _Confidential Disclosure Agreement_ "), between Company and
Parent. In this regard, Company acknowledges that Parent is a publicly traded
corporation and that any information obtained during the course of its due
diligence could be considered to be material non-public information within the
meaning of federal and state securities Laws. Accordingly, Company
acknowledges and agrees not to (and shall cause its officers and employees
not to) engage in any discussions, correspondence or transactions in the
shares of Parent in violation of applicable securities Laws. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent shall, with the prior Written consent of Company
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), be
permitted to contact customers and channel partners of Company and discuss the
business of Company; _provided, however,_ that, if desired by Company, a
representative of Company shall participate in any such discussions.

5.5 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise
provided herein, all transaction expenses shall be the obligation of the
respective party incurring such fees and expenses. Fifty percent (50%) of the
expenses and fees of the Escrow Agent shall be pre-closing Third Party
Expenses of Company for purposes of this Agreement and the other fifty
percent (50%) shall be paid by Parent. All expenses and fees of the Exchange
Agent and Depository Agent shall be paid by Parent.

 



-43- 5.6 _Public Disclosure_. No party shall issue any statement or communication
to any third party (other than their respective Representatives that are
bound by confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable,
the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the
Written consent of Parent or Company, as applicable, except that this
restriction shall (a) be subject to Parent and its Affiliates obligation to
comply with applicable securities laws and the rules of The NASDAQ Stock
Market and (b) not restrict any party from responding accurately and fully to
any question, inquiry or request for information when required by legal
process. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
following public announcement of the Merger, the Stockholder Representative
shall be permitted to publicly disclose that it has been engaged to serve as
the Stockholder Representative in connection with the Merger, as long as
such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated herein. Parent and Company shall issue a
mutually agreeable press release following the execution of this Agreement in
substantially the form attached hereto as _E XHIBIT H_; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, following the issuance of such press release,
Parent and Company shall be permitted to issue any statement or communication
consistent with the information contained in the press release.

5.7 _Consents_. Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of any parties to any Contract
set forth on _S CHEDULE 5.7_, so as to preserve all rights of, and benefits
to, Company under such Contract from and after the Effective Time.
Such consents, waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent. In the event that the other parties to any such Contract, including
lessor or licensor of any Leased Real Property, conditions its grant of a
consent, waiver or approval (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration, including increased rent
payments or other payments under the Contract, Company shall be responsible
for making all payments required to obtain such consent, waiver or approval,
which payments shall constitute Third Party Expenses and thus shall be
reflected on the Closing Statement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as obligating Parent to pay or commit to pay any amount in order to
obtain any consent, waiver, or approval prior to the Closing in order to
fulfill any of the conditions to Closing. To the extent any such Consent
set forth on _S CHEDULE 5.7_ is not obtained prior to the Closing, all costs
associated with and expenses incurred by Parent or Surviving Corporation in
obtaining any such Consents after the Closing, including any consent
fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration, including increased
rent payments or other payments under the applicable Contract, shall be deemed
Third Party Expenses for which Parent shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2.

5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Sub, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other party of:
(a) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which
cause, in the case of Company, failure of the condition set forth in Section
7.2(a)(i), and, in the case of Parent or Sub, failure of the condition set
forth in Section 7.3(a)(i), (c) any failure of such party to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder, which would cause, in the case of Company, failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a)(ii), and, the case of Parent or Sub,
failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a)(ii), (d) any notice or
other Written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (e) with respect to Company only, the
occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect or any condition, event, fact or
circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of the condition set
forth in Section 7.2(g) impossible or unlikely; _provided_ ,

 



-44-   _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8
shall not (i) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the party
receiving such notice or (ii) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a
breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by Company pursuant to this Section
5.8, however, shall be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedule
or prevent or cure any misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of
covenant. No notification under this Section 5.8 shall be required with
respect to matters consented to in Writing by Parent or the actual taking of
actions contemplated by Section 4.1 of the Disclosure Schedule. In the event
of a failure to perform any covenant set forth in this Section 5.8, the claim
for the underlying matter as to which notice should have been delivered shall
be made by reference to the applicable provision of this Agreement with
respect to such matter and not as a breach of a covenant in this Section 5.8;
claims for breach of the obligations to make the notice required by this
Section 5.8 may be made by reference to this Section 5.8.

5.9 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances_. Each party hereto, at the
request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.10 _Employment Arrangements_.

 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Closing
(the " _Transition Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Acquired
Companies or any other Subsidiary of Parent to provide to each Continuing
Employee (i) the base salary and wages at least equal to that in effect for
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
retirement and welfare benefits (other than equity or equity-related awards)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent (for the avoidance of doubt, paid
time off policies shall be governed by Parents policies with respect to such
matters). During the Transition Period, Parent shall (and Parent shall cause
the Acquired Companies and any other Subsidiary of Parent), to the extent
employee benefits plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent replace or are
substituted for currently existing Company Employee Plans; (A) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be waived for Continuing Employees
in the United States all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods and all evidence of insurability and actively
at work requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
under any group health plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in which
such Continuing Employees in the United States may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and
waiting periods would have been waived or satisfied under the corresponding
group health plan in which any such Continuing Employee in the United States
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time; (B) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to each Continuing Employee credit in satisfying
any applicable co-payments, deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under
any welfare plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent in which such
Continuing Employees in the United States may be eligible to participate after
the Effective Time for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs
paid under any corresponding group health plan in which any such Continuing
Employee in the United States participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, in respect of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs; and
(C) provide to each Continuing Employee credit for all service recognized by
the Acquired Companies under a corresponding Company Employee Plan for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under each
employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of Parent, the Acquired
Companies and any other Subsidiary of Parent in which such Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing, and for purposes of
determining the amount of benefits under any severance or vacation plan,
program or arrangement, or other benefit program that bases benefits in whole
or in part on length of service, of Parent, the Acquired Companies and any
other Subsidiary of Parent; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall any
Continuing Employee be entitled to service credit to the extent that such
service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of 

 



-45-  service. In addition, Continuing Employees outside of the United States
shall receive credit for vacation balances accrued but not used and as set
forth on Section 2.21(a) of the Disclosure Schedule under Parents and its
Subsidiaries paid time off policies, as required under locally applicable
Law, in which such Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Subject to any agreement between a Continuing Employee and Parent, an
Acquired Company or any other Subsidiary of Parent or applicable Laws, the
employment of each Continuing Employee will be "at will" employment.

(c) At least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing, Company shall terminate
the employment of (i) each employee of the Acquired Companies who receives an
offer of continued employment with either Parent or the Surviving Corporation
but does not accept such offer (the " _Declining Employees_ ") and (ii) those
employees set forth on a separate schedule to be delivered to Company by
Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to Closing (the "
_Terminated Employees_ ") (such employees described in clause (i) and (ii),
together with any employee of the Acquired Companies who voluntarily
terminates his or her employment with such Acquired Company prior to
Closing, " _Non-Continuing Employees_ "). All severance costs, as well as
amounts to be paid pursuant to applicable Laws, including expenses related
thereto, resulting from or arising in connection with the termination of the
Declining Employees, shall be borne by Company (the " _Company Severance
Expenses_ "). All severance costs, amounts to be paid pursuant to applicable
Laws, including expenses related thereto, and any Losses resulting from the
termination of the Terminated Employees, including with respect to any Action
brought by any Terminated Employee (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes
any liability under the WARN Act), shall be borne by Parent (collectively, the
" _Parent Severance Expenses_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will be
construed to create a right in any employee of the Acquired Companies to
employment with Parent or, following the Effective Time, any Acquired Company,
or any other Subsidiary of Parent, and, subject to any agreement between a
Continuing Employee and Parent, an Acquired Company or any other Subsidiary
of Parent, the employment of each Continuing Employee will be "at will"
employment, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed under the WARN Act or by applicable Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Parents determinations
regarding the Terminated Employees, the Acquired Companies and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with each other and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such notification or consultation requirements to be
complied with prior to the Effective Time.

5.11 _Termination of Employee Plans; Employee Matters_.

(a) No later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, each
Acquired Company shall terminate any Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "), unless
Parent provides Written notice that such 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated,
which notice shall be provided not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date. Unless Parent provides such Written notice to Company, no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date)
pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of Company or such ERISA
Affiliate, as the case may be. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to review and reasonable approval of Parent (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause a retirement plan maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to accept direct and
indirect rollover distributions, on behalf of Continuing Employees who
participate in 

 



-46-  such retirement plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, of their account balances,
including loans, maintained by them under the Acquired Companies 401(k)
Plans. Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such 401(k) Plan(s) of the Acquired Companies as Parent may
reasonably require; _provided_ that Parent provides notice of such
requested action no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. In the event that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees
other than ordinary administrative expenses incurred in connection with the

necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and
provide such estimate in Writing to Parent no later than five (5) days prior

units covering shares of Company Common Stock as may be directed by Parent in
consultation with Companys Chief Executive Officer pursuant to the 2016
Company Option Plan and Company RSU Agreement (the " _Company RSUs_ "),
contingent upon and subject to the consummation of the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company RSUs value shall not be included in the Total
Merger Consideration and the grant of Company RSU shall have no effect on the
amount of Total Merger Consideration payable in respect of Company Capital
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants.

Date, Company and its ERISA Affiliates shall terminate each Company Employee
Plan set forth on _S CHEDULE 5.11(c)_. For the avoidance of any doubt, the

shall be effected without any payment or benefit (or giving rights to any
payment or benefit) thereunder. Company shall provide Parent evidence that
such plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the boards of
directors of Company and of its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Company Stockholder, (v) the amount of cash (without regard to withholding

such Company Option and Company Warrant, (iii) the respective

 



-47-  Company Option and Warrant Numbers, as applicable (iv) the grant dates of

respect to such Company Options and Company Warrants (including for each
Company Option, the number of shares that are vested and unvested as of the
Closing), (vi) with respect to each Company Option, whether such Company
Options are incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, (vii)
with respect to each Company Option, whether such Company Option is a Cashed-
Out Option, Cancelled Option or Assumed Option, (viii) with respect to each

for and the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Stock issuable
upon exercise of such Assumed Option. The Closing Allocation Schedule also

6045 of the Code), the acquisition date and tax basis of such security.

5.13 _No Liability for New Employees or Former Employees_. In the event the
Merger is not consummated, the parties hereto agree that neither Parent nor
Sub shall have any liability for (i) any employees hired by Company after the
date hereof and (ii) any employees that terminate their employment
with Company after the date hereof.

5.14 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of
this Agreement in favor of the current and former directors and officers of
the Acquired Companies (each a " _Covered Person_ ") shall survive the Merger
and therefore shall be enforceable against the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Company shall obtain and fully pay for
irrevocable "tail" officer and director liability insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in scope
at least as favorable as Companys existing policies (with no denigration of
Side B or Side C coverage) covering the current and former directors and
officers of the Acquired Companies and the Acquired Companies themselves and
such payment shall constitute a Third Party Expense. The tail shall be
purchased with a $5 million limit with full coverage for pre-Closing alleged
wrongful acts; the additional $2 million above the current $3 million in
coverage shall be obtained, if required by the insurer, by the execution of a
well-negotiated warranty statement by Company that includes full severability,
if possible. Such tail policies shall continue to name SolidFire, Inc. as the
insured entity with unrestricted access to make claims under Side B and C
coverage (but shall not in any way make Parent an insured for purposes of any
insurer vs insured or entity vs insured exclusion). Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts so that such tail policies are no less
favorable than Companys existing policies with respect to any coverage,
including any exclusion of coverage for actions brought by one insured against
another insured or insureds. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
(and its successors) to maintain such "tail" policy and not take any action to
amend, modify or terminate the DandO Tail Policy during the term thereof.

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.14 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each current and
former director and officer of Company and his

 



-48-  or her heirs and personal representatives. The provisions of this Section
5.14 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without
the prior Written consent of the affected current or former director or
officer.

intent of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

clearance from Governmental Entities, (C) respond as promptly as practicable

applicable Law. Company shall provide any Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence to Parent within a reasonable period of time prior to
filing, shall permit Parent to review and comment on any such Tax Return prior
to filing and shall consider such comments in good faith. Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, which Tax
Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with the Ordinary
Course of Company and its Subsidiaries unless otherwise required by applicable

conditioned or delayed) prior to filing any such Tax Return. Parent shall pay
or cause to be paid all Taxes required to be paid with each such Tax Return,
provided that Parent may recover from the Escrow Account, without duplication
of any amount recovered pursuant to Article VIII (by reducing the amount of
such Escrow Account) (or, at its election, otherwise pursuant to Article VIII)
Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return. Parent will not file, or
cause to be filed, any other Tax Returns, including any amended Tax Returns
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, that reports any liability for Taxes for which
the Company Holders would have an obligation to indemnify under this
Agreement without the prior Written consent of the Stockholder Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of Company and its Subsidiaries for all
Straddle Periods. Parent shall provide any Tax Return described in the
preceding sentence to the Stockholder Representative within fourteen (14) days
prior to filing, shall permit the Stockholder Representative to review and

condition or delayed) prior to filing any such Tax Return. Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due on each such Tax Return,
_provided, however,_ that Parent may recover from the Escrow Account, without
duplication of any amount recovered pursuant to Article VIII (by reducing the
amount of such Escrow Account) (or, at its election, otherwise pursuant to
Article VIII) the Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on such Straddle Period Tax
Return. For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of
such Tax which relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or
related to income, receipts, sales, use tax, value added tax, goods and
services tax, withholding tax or payroll tax, be deemed to be the amount of

ending on and including the Closing Date and (ii) the denominator of which is
the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period and (b) in the case
of any Tax based upon or related to income, receipts, sales, use tax, value

basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative shall (a) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to Company relating to any taxable period beginning before

the extent notified, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Tax Authority, and (b) to give the other party fourteen (14) days
Written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if the other party so requests, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholder Representative, as the case may be, shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and records at such
other partys expense.

 

6.4 _Contest Provisions_. If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries receives notice of a Tax Contest which
could give rise solely to Pre-Closing Taxes, then within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt of such notice, Parent shall notify the Stockholder
Representative of such notice; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the
part of Parent to so notify the Stockholder Representative shall not limit any
of the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under Article VIII, unless the
Indemnifying Parties demonstrate actual damage caused by such delay or
failure, and then only to the extent thereof. The Stockholder Representative
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that the Stockholder Representative
shall keep Parent fully and timely informed with respect to the status of any
such Tax Contest controlled by it and the Stockholder Representative shall in
good faith allow Parent to make comments to the Stockholder Representative
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such Tax Contest. With
respect to any other Tax Contest, Parent shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided however that, if any such

Taxes, then (a) the Stockholder Representative shall have the right, at the
expense of the Company Holders, to participate in any such Tax Contest, (b)
settlement or other resolution of any such Tax Contest shall be subject to
the consent of Stockholder Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, condition or delayed), and (c) Parent shall keep Stockholder
Representative fully and timely informed with respect to the status of such
Tax Contest and Parent shall in good faith allow Stockholder Representative to
make comments to Parent regarding the conduct of or positions taken in such
Tax Contest. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax
Contest, except that the Indemnified Parties may be entitled to
indemnification for their costs pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent of
any inconsistency between this Section 6.4 and Section 8.3(f), the provisions
of this Section 6.4 shall control.

6.5 _Tax Overpayments_. Any and all overpayments of Pre-Closing Taxes that
are actually received by Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date (whether by way of refund or by way of a credit against Taxes), shall be
for the account of the Company Holders. Such refunds or credits (net of costs
and expenses in obtaining such refund or credit) shall be paid over to the
Company Holders pursuant to this Agreement, within fourteen (14) days after
the receipt of such amount; _provided, however,_ any overpayment of Taxes
shall be for the account of Parent to the extent such overpayment results
from a carryback of losses or other tax attributes generated in a taxable
period, or portion thereof, beginning after the Closing Date. In the event
that an amount paid by Parent or Company under this Section 6.5 is
subsequently denied by a Tax Authority, Parent shall be entitled to claim such
amount pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article VIII.

 



-52- 6.6 _Limitation on Post-Closing Tax Actions_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, (a) following the Closing, neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates will without the consent of the Stockholder Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), cause
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any extraordinary
transaction, tax structuring transaction, or other non-ordinary course
transaction with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would
reasonably be expected to increase the Company Holders indemnity obligations
with respect to Taxes pursuant to this Agreement and (b) neither Parent nor
its Affiliates shall cause to be filed any election under Section 338 or
Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, recording, value added and
other Taxes (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Company Holders. Parent shall prepare
and file any Tax Return that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes
and, to the extent necessary, the Company Holders will join in the execution
of such Tax Returns. 

6.8 _Payroll Taxes._ Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this
Section 6.8, Company Holders shall bear all employer-level employment or
payroll Taxes (" _Payroll Taxes_ ") with respect to (a) any payment to an
Employee Cashed-Out Option Holder in respect of such holders Cashed-Out
Options, (b) any Company Severance Expenses, and (c) any Closing Company CIC
Payments. Parent shall bear all Payroll Taxes with respect to (i) any Parent
Severance Expenses made in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (ii) any payments with respect to the Upward Adjustment
Amount and the release of the Escrow Account.

paid by Parent pursuant to Article I of this Agreement for all purposes,
including Tax purposes, and shall be treated as such by all parties on their
Tax Returns unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The representations and warranties of Company contained in Article II of
this Agreement or in the Company Certificate shall survive the fifteen (15)
month period immediately following the Closing Date (the expiration of such
period, the " _Survival Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Fundamental
Representations hereof shall survive for the seven (7) year period immediately
following the Closing Date (the " _Fundamental Rep Survival Date_ "), except
for the representations and warranties of Company contained in Section 2.11
(Tax Matters) hereof shall survive until thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. All covenants and other
agreements of Company in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the
Closing shall terminate and expire on the Survival Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that notice of any Claim for indemnification under
this Article VIII has been delivered prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified above, the specific representation,
warranty or covenant that is the subject of such indemnification claim shall
survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is
finally resolved pursuant to the terms hereof.

 



-57- (b) All representations and warranties made by Parent and Sub in Article III
of this Agreement or in the Parent Certificate shall terminate and expire as
of the Effective Time, and any liability of Parent or Sub with respect to such
representations and warranties shall thereupon cease.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that if the Surviving Corporation
suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Loss as a result of or in
connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the
Surviving Corporation as an Indemnified Party) Parent shall also be deemed, by
virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have
incurred such Loss as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or
breach.

 

8.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, by virtue of the adoption and approval
of the Merger by the Requisite Stockholder Approval and the Joinder
Agreements, the Company Holders (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") agree,
severally (but not jointly), in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Portion of the Losses, to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and
its officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and Representatives,
including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs, interest, awards, judgments, penalties and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and
including any such reasonable expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing, and
diminution in value (hereinafter individually a " _Loss_ " and collectively "
_Losses_ "; _provided_ , _however_ , that any punitive damages shall not be
included in the definition of Losses unless actually paid to a third party)
incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including
the Surviving Corporation), directly or indirectly, as a result of (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty (without giving effect
to any qualification as to materiality contained therein solely for the
purpose of determining the amount of any Loss) of Company contained in Article
II of this Agreement or in the Company Certificate, (ii) any failure by
Company to perform or comply with any covenant applicable to it contained in
this Agreement, (iii) any Dissenting Share Payments, (iv) any Third Party
Expenses or Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies that is not reflected on
the Closing Statement or taken into account in the calculation of the Adjusted
Merger Consideration, (v) any fraud committed by any Acquired Company or
Company Holder prior to the Closing in connection with the negotiation or
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement (" _Fraud_ "), (vi) any
DandO Loss, (vii) any Pre-Closing Taxes, (viii) any inaccuracies in the Closing
Allocation Schedule or any Claim related to or arising out of the
distribution of any portion of the Total Merger Consideration in accordance
with the Closing Allocation Schedule, or (ix) any such matters as set forth on
_S CHEDULE 8.2 (a)_ hereof.

 

8.3 _Limitations and Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Basket Amount and Other Limitations_. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, except as set forth in the second sentence of
this Section 8.3(a), an Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses under
Section 8.2(a)(i) unless and until such Losses under Section 8.2 exceed
$6,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case Parent
shall be entitled to recover all Losses (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Basket Amount). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be
entitled to recover for, and the Basket Amount shall not apply as a threshold
to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to Losses resulting from
(i) any breach of a representation or warranty contained in the Fundamental
Representations or (ii) any claim pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(ii) through
8.2(a)(ix) (collectively, " _Exempted Losses_ "). Except for Exempted Losses,
recovery of the amount of funds then in the Escrow Account (less any funds
then required to be released from the Escrow Account) shall be the sole and
exclusive source of recovery of

 



-58-  the Indemnified Parties. The aggregate amount of Exempted Losses that may be
recovered by an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) shall not exceed the aggregate proceeds received by such
Indemnifying Party hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
(i) the limitations set forth in this Section 8.3(a) shall not apply with
respect to any claim based on Fraud against the Person who committed such
Fraud and (ii), except with respect to amounts paid from the Escrow Account,
no Company Holder shall be liable for, or provide any indemnification with
respect to, the Fraud of another Company Holder (excluding any Fraud
committed by any director, officer or employee of the Company acting in their
capacity or purported capacity as such, it being agreed that Fraud committed
by such Person shall be deemed a Fraud committed by the Company).

 

(b) _Insurance; Other Limitations_. Each Indemnified Party acknowledges and
agrees that, for purposes hereof, any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be calculated based on the amount of such Losses that remains
after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds (net of all expenses incurred
in the collection thereof and all increases in premiums resulting therefrom)
actually received by an Indemnified Party with respect thereto. Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery for any such Losses
from any of its or the Surviving Corporations then-existing insurance
policies and to otherwise mitigate Losses. No Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to any indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) to the extent such
matter was taken into account in determining the Initial Merger Consideration
or Adjusted Merger Consideration.

(c) _Satisfaction of Claims_.

 

(i) Except for Exempted Losses, claims by an Indemnified Party for Losses
shall be satisfied solely from the Escrow Account. Claims by an Indemnified
Party for Exempted Losses, shall be satisfied: (A) first, from the Escrow
Account, but only after (1) satisfying all other pending claims that are not
claims for Exempted Losses, and (2) making appropriate reserve as provided
herein for any then unresolved claims that are not claims for Exempted Losses,
and (B) second, if the Escrow Account is insufficient after such satisfaction
or reserve, (1) in the case of Fraud, at the election of the
Indemnified Party and in any combination the Indemnified Party elects,
directly from each Company Holder, severally in accordance with such holders
Pro Rata Portion of the Losses, up to the aggregate proceeds received by such
Company Holder hereunder and/or directly and individually from such Person or
Persons committing such Fraud, jointly and severally among such Persons,
without limit, and (2) in the case of Exempted Losses other than Fraud,
directly from each Company Holder, severally in accordance with such holders
Pro Rata Portion of the Losses, in an amount not to exceed the aggregate
proceeds received by such Company Holder hereunder.

 

(ii) The representations and warranties, covenants and obligations of Company,
and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties,
will not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information
furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of the
Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates. Such representations
and warranties, covenants and obligations will not be affected or deemed
waived by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Parties knew or should have
known that any representation or warranty might be inaccurate or that the
Indemnifying Party failed to comply with any agreement or covenant. Any
investigation by such party will be for its own protection only and will not
affect or impair any right or remedy hereunder.

 



-59- (d) _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(i) If at any time prior to the Survival Date or Fundamental Rep Survival
Date, as applicable, Parent determines in good faith that any Indemnified
Party has a bona fide claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII,
Parent may deliver to the Stockholder Representative a certificate signed by
an officer of Parent (any certificate delivered in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 8.3(d)(i), an " _Officer s Claim Certificate_"):

(A) stating that an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII (or, in addition to and not limitation of any
indemnification an Indemnified Party has available pursuant to Article VIII,
with respect to any Tax matters, a Tax Authority has raised such Tax matter
in audit of Parent or its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries), which could give rise to indemnifiable Losses);

 

(B) to the extent possible, contain a good faith non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the amount of all indemnifiable Losses to which such Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled to receive under this Article VIII, which shall be
the amount of Losses such Indemnified Party has so incurred or suffered or
would reasonably be expected to incur or suffer in the future; and

(C) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed
by Parent) the material facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to
such claim and setting forth the specific representation and warranty or
covenant alleged to have been breached by Company or other item of
indemnification alleged to be at issue.

 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative in good faith objects to any Claim made
by Parent in any Officers Claim Certificate, then the Stockholder
Representative shall deliver a Written notice (a " _Claim Dispute Notice_ ")
to Parent during the 30-day period commencing upon receipt by the Stockholder
Representative of the Officers Claim Certificate. The Claim Dispute Notice
shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal basis for the dispute of
any Claim made by Parent in the Officers Claim Certificate. If the
Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to
Parent prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, then (A) each Claim for
indemnification set forth in such Officers Claim Certificate shall be deemed
to have been conclusively determined in Parents favor for purposes of
this Article VIII on the terms set forth in the Officers Claim Certificate
and (B) if cash remains in the Escrow Account, then Parent may direct the
Escrow Agent to deliver cash from the Escrow Account to Parent the amount
of Losses specified in such Officers Claim Certificate that have been
incurred or suffered to the date of such certificate.

(iii) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Claim Dispute Notice, then
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any such objections raised by the Stockholder Representative in such
Claim Dispute Notice. If Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree to a
resolution of such objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters
conclusively determined by Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, if cash remains in the Escrow
Account and if applicable, promptly delivered to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to distribute cash from the Escrow Account in accordance with
the terms of such memorandum.

 

(iv) If no such resolution can be reached during the forty-five (45)-day
period following Parents receipt of a given Claim Dispute Notice, then upon
the expiration of such forty-five (45)-day period, either Parent or the
Stockholder Representative may bring suit to resolve the objection in
accordance with Sections 10.10 and 10.12. Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall promptly direct the Escrow Agent to act in
accordance with the final, non-appealable decision reached pursuant to
Sections 10.10 and 10.12 and distribute cash from the Escrow Account in
accordance therewith, if applicable. Judgment upon any final, non-appealable
award rendered pursuant to Sections 10.10 and 10.12 may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.

 

(e) _No Contribution_. No Indemnifying Party shall have, or be entitled to
exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation to
which such Indemnifying Party may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement. 

 



-60- (f) _Third Party Claims_. Except as otherwise provided in Article VI, in
the event of the assertion of the commencement by any Person of any action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending by or before any
Governmental Entity (whether against the Surviving Corporation, against Parent
or against any other Person) with respect to which any of the Indemnifying
Parties may become obligated to indemnify and hold harmless, any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article VIII (each, a " _Claim_ "), Parent shall have
the right, at its election, to proceed with and control the defense of such
Claim, including the right to assert counterclaims. If Parent so proceeds with
the defense of any such Claim:

 

(i) upon Parents request, the Stockholder Representative shall instruct each
Indemnifying Party to, make available to Parent any documents and materials
in its possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the defense
of such Claim; and

(ii) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Claim
without the consent of the Stockholder Representative, it being understood
that any such settlement, adjustment or compromise effected without the
consent of the Stockholder Representative will not be dispositive of the
existence of an indemnifiable claim or the amount of Losses.

Parent shall give the Stockholder Representative prompt notice of the
commencement of any Claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Stockholder Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Indemnifying Parties under this Article VIII, unless the Indemnifying Parties
demonstrate actual damage caused by such delay or failure, and then only to
the extent thereof.

 

(g) _Release of Remaining Escrow Account_. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly release a
portion of the Escrow Account equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow
Amount, less the amount of claims previously paid and the amount of any
pending claims for which an Officers Claim Certificate was delivered prior to
the Initial Escrow Release Date pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, to
(i) the Depository Agent no later than three (3) Business Days following the
Initial Escrow Release Date for payment to the Company Holders (other than
Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation for
payment to the Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system, in accordance with its customary payroll
practices (subject to applicable withholding Taxes), in each case, in
accordance with the Closing Allocation Schedule. Promptly, and in any event,
no later than three (3) Business Days following the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release and deliver the entire
remaining balance of the Escrow Account (if any), less the amount of any
pending claims for which an Officers Claim Certificate was delivered prior
to the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, to (A) the Depository Agent for payment to the
Company Holders (other than Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
such Company Holder for such purpose and (B) the Surviving Corporation for
payment to the Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders through the Surviving
Corporations payroll system, in accordance with its customary payroll
practices (subject to applicable withholding Taxes), in each case, in
accordance with the Closing Allocation Schedule. At any time following the
fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing Date, to the extent the portion
of the Escrow Account exceeds the amount of all pending claims for which an
Officers Claim Certificate was delivered prior to the fifteen (15) month
anniversary of the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to promptly release and

 



-61-  deliver such excess to (A) the Depository Agent for payment to the Company
Holders (other than Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by such Company Holder
for such purpose and (B) the Surviving Corporation for payment to the Employee
Cashed-Out Option Holders through the Surviving Corporations payroll system,
in accordance with its customary payroll practices (subject to applicable
withholding Taxes), in each case, in accordance with the Closing Allocation
Schedule.

(h) _Certain Waivers, etc_. Effective upon the Closing, each Company Holder
hereby irrevocably waives, releases and discharges Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates from any and all liabilities and
obligations to it, in connection with such Company Holders relationship with
Company (whether in its capacity as a shareholder, manager, member, officer or
director of Company or any of its Affiliates or otherwise (including in
respect of any rights of contribution or indemnification)), in each case
whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown,
and whether arising under any agreement or understanding or otherwise at law
or equity (the " _Released Claims_ "), and each Company Holder agrees that it
shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder
from Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates;
_provided, however,_ that nothing contained herein shall operate to release,
and the Released Claims shall not include (i) any rights or claims available
to it under this Agreement, the Related Agreements or any other agreement
entered into by the undersigned in connection with the execution of this
Agreement or the Merger; (ii) rights to continuing indemnification under the
Charter Documents or any indemnification agreement between Company and such
Company Holders; and (iii) any rights to receive salaries, bonuses, expenses
or other payments or compensation, unreimbursed claims under health and
welfare plans and the entitlement to continuation coverage benefits or other
similar benefits required to be provided by Law. In no event shall Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates have any
liability whatsoever to any Company Holder (or any Affiliate of any Company
Holder) for breaches of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants of Company hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of
this Section 8.3(h), "Affiliates" shall not include any portfolio company or
limited partner of any Company Holder that is a venture capital fund.

 

8.4 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, each of the Company Holders shall be deemed
to have agreed to appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its agent
and attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of
the Company Holders to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Account in
satisfaction of claims by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments,
to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and bring
suit and comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and bring suit and
comply with orders of courts with respect to, any other claim by any
Indemnified Party against any Company Holder or by any such Company Holder
against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and
any such Company Holder, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the
Company Holders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
Written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority interest of the
Escrow Account agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. A vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled
by the vote of holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Account. No
bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative. With respect to
matters set forth in Section 1.7, Article VI and Article VIII, notices or
communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from the Company Holders.

 



-62- (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Company Holder
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while
acting in good faith and absent its gross negligence or bad faith. The Company
Holders shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the
Stockholder Representative harmless against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of
this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided,_ that in the
event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been
directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the
Company Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to the
extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Company Holders, any
such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative
from (i) the funds in the Stockholder Representative Fund, and (ii) the
amounts in the Escrow Account at such time as remaining amounts would
otherwise be distributable to the Company Holders; _provided,_ that while this
section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Stockholder
Representative Fund and the Escrow Account, this does not relieve the
Company Holders from their obligation to promptly pay, in accordance with
their Pro Rata Portion of such Representative Losses in an amount not to
exceed the aggregate proceeds received by each such Company Holder hereunder
(reduced by the aggregate amount of indemnification payments required to be
paid by such Company Holder pursuant to Article VIII), such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own
funds on behalf of the Company Holders or otherwise. The Company Holders
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative or the termination of
this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative, including but not limited to an amendment, extension or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.3 and 9.4 hereof, shall constitute a
decision of the Company Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive
upon the Company Holders; and Parent may rely upon any such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company Holders. Parent is hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative.

(c) The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to withdraw cash amounts
held in the Stockholder Representative Fund in reimbursement for its out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in performing its obligations under this Agreement.
The Company Holders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Stockholder Representative Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not
be liable for any loss of principal of the Stockholder Representative Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Contemporaneous with or as soon as
practicable following the completion of the Stockholder Representatives
duties, the Stockholder Representative will deliver the balance of the
Stockholder Representative Fund to (i) the Depository Agent for further
distribution to the Company Holders (other than Employee Cashed-Out
Option Holders) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by such Company Holder for such purpose and (ii) the

 



-63-  Surviving Corporation for payment to the Employee Cashed-Out Option Holders
through the Surviving Corporations payroll system, in each case, in
accordance with the Closing Allocation Schedule and, for the avoidance of
doubt, such payments shall not be subject to information reporting or tax
withholding. The Stockholder Representative Fund Amount shall be deemed to
have been received by the Company Holders at the Closing (in accordance with
their respective Pro Rata Portions) for U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes and then each Company Holder shall be deemed to have
voluntarily contributed such amount to the Stockholder Representative
Fund, any withholding in respect thereof shall be satisfied from the portion
of the Initial Merger Consideration owing to the Company Holders on the
Closing Date and, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Stockholder

(a) by mutual agreement of Company and Parent;

(b) by Parent or Company, by giving Written notice of such termination to the
other, if: (i) there shall be a final non-appealable order of a federal or
state court in effect preventing consummation of the Merger, or (ii) there
shall be any Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the
Closing by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the
Closing illegal;

(c) by Parent, by giving Written notice of such termination to Company, if
within twenty-four (24) hours following the execution of this Agreement, the
condition in Section 7.2(h)(i) has not been satisfied or fulfilled; _provided,
however,_ that this termination right shall no longer apply and shall expire
if not invoked by Parent prior to actual deliver of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval (regardless of timing); or

 



-64- (d) by Company, by giving Written notice of such termination to Parent, if (i)
Company has submitted this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
Merger to the Company Stockholders and such Company Stockholders representing
a number of Company Capital Stock have voted against, or abstained from, such
approval and adoption such that the Requisite Stockholder Approval cannot be
obtained, and, as a result thereof, the condition set forth in Section
7.2(h)(i) cannot be satisfied or fulfilled, or (ii) one hundred twenty (120)
days have passed from the date of this Agreement and Company has submitted
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the Merger to the Company
Stockholders and such Company Stockholders representing less than the
Requisite Stockholder Approval have voted in favor of such approval and
adoption, and therefore, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(h)(i) has not
been satisfied or fulfilled.

(e) by Parent, by giving Written notice of such termination to Company, if
there shall be any final, non-appealable action taken, or any statute, rule,

Merger by any U.S. Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parents
ownership or operation of any portion of the business of Company or (ii)
compel Parent or Company to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of
the business or assets of Company or Parent as a result of the Merger;

(f) by Parent, by giving Written notice of such termination to Company, if it
is not in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Company contained in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such breach has not been
cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written notice thereof to
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that no cure period shall be required for a
breach which by its nature cannot be cured;

(g) by Company, by giving Written notice of such termination to Parent, if
Company is not in material breach of any of its obligations under this
Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Parent contained in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a) hereof would not be satisfied and such
breach has not been cured within twenty (20) calendar days after written
notice thereof to Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no cure period shall
be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured;

 

(h) by Company, by giving Written notice of such termination to Parent, if
Company has received a Superior Proposal prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, but only if Company (i) has given Parent at least five
(5) full Business Days (the " _Match Period_ ") Written notice of the
existence and material terms of the Superior Proposal and allowed Parent
during such period the opportunity to match or exceed the terms of the
Superior Proposal (and has further allowed Parent an additional Match Period
for each time that a Superior Proposal is subsequently materially modified),
and (ii) has paid Parent the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement; or

(i) by Company or Parent, by giving Written notice of such termination to the
other party, if the Closing shall have not occurred within 180 days of the
date of this Agreement, unless extended by Written agreement of Company, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent; _provided that_ , the
terminating party is not in material breach of this Agreement and has
otherwise satisfied its conditions hereunder.

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Company, or
their respective officers, directors or stockholders, if

 



-65-  applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party hereto and each Person
shall remain liable for any intentional and willful breaches of this Agreement
prior to its termination; and  _provided further_ , _however_ , that, the
provisions of Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 hereof, Article X hereof and this
Section 9.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Article IX. In the event this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 9.1(h), Company
shall promptly pay Parent (i) $34,800,000 in cash (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "),
and (ii) Parents reasonable fees and expenses, including for outside counsel
and financial and accounting experts, related to the negotiation and due
diligence to enter into this Agreement (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ").

9.3 _Amendment_. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be amended
by Parent, Company, Sub and the Stockholder Representative, but at any time
after any approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company
Stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by such Company Stockholders without such further approval. After
the Closing, this Agreement may be amended only with the approval of Parent
and the Stockholder Representative. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in Writing signed on behalf of the applicable Persons set
forth in this Section 9.3.

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one
hand, and Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in Writing signed on behalf of
such party. Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time
for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or
noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than
that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

10.2 _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes" and "including" when
used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedule or any Appendix, Schedule or Exhibit attached hereto and
not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this
Agreement. The parties hereto intend that each representation, warranty and

 



-67-  covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) which such party has not breached shall not detract
from or mitigate the fact that such party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty or covenant.

10.3 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Disclosure Schedule shall be subject to
the following terms and conditions: (a) any item disclosed in any particular
part or section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in
all other parts or sections of the Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent of its face that such disclosure is related to such
other particular part or section of the Disclosure Schedule; (b) no disclosure
of any matter contained in the applicable Disclosure Schedule shall create an
implication that such matter meets any standard of materiality (matters
reflected in the applicable Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the applicable
Disclosure Schedule; such additional matters are set forth for informational
purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar
nature, nor shall the inclusion of any item be construed as implying that any
such item is "material" for any purpose); and (c) headings and introductory
language have been inserted on the sections of the applicable Disclosure
Schedule for convenience of reference only and shall to no extent have the
effect of amending or changing the express description of the sections as set
forth in this Agreement.

10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

10.5 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidential Disclosure
Agreement, and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the
parties hereto referenced herein (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings both Written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, that
certain non-binding term sheet letter agreement by and between Parent
and Company, dated as of November 18, 2015, (b) are not intended to confer
upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, and (c) shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that Parent may assign its
rights and delegate its obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as
Parent remains ultimately liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder.

 

10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

10.7 _Specific Performance_. Each of Company, Stockholder Representative, Sub
and Parent acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged
irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that the other parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court in the
United States or in any state having jurisdiction over the parties and the
matter in addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled pursuant
hereto.

 



-68- 10.8 _Other Remedies_. Subject to the provisions of Article VIII, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof. The parties agree that his Agreement is a sealed instrument and shall
be construed as such under the laws of the State of Delaware.

10.10 _Dispute Resolution; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 1.7(d), the parties hereby agree that, in
order to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of any disputes under this
Agreement, each claim, dispute or controversy solely seeking money damages in
an amount not exceeding $20,000,000, and arising out of a claim for
indemnification under Article VIII or arising out of, in connection with, or
in relation to, the interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement,
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any claim based on
contract, tort or statute, or the arbitrability of any claim hereunder (an "
_Arbitrable Claim_ "), shall be settled by final and binding arbitration
conducted by arbitration under the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Act (the "
_DRAA_ ") and the Delaware Rapid Arbitration Rules. This provision to
arbitrate shall be governed by Delaware law, as it may exist at the time of
the demand for arbitration, without reference to the law chosen by any other
provision of this Agreement. The place of the arbitration shall be
Wilmington, Delaware. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall be one of
those persons who has served as a trial judge in the State of Delaware. All
such Arbitrable Claims shall be settled by one (1) arbitrator (the "
_Neutral Arbitrator_ ") which shall be selected by the mutual agreement of
Parent and the Stockholder Representative. If Parent and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to agree upon the identity of the Neutral Arbitrator
within thirty (30) days of the commencement of the Arbitrable Claim, the
parties shall file a petition with the Court of Chancery pursuant to Section
5805 of the DRAA seeking the appointment of a Neutral Arbitrator. In either
event, such arbitrator may not have any preexisting, direct or indirect
relationship with any party to the dispute. Each party hereto expressly
consents to, and waives any future objection to, such forum and arbitration
rules. The arbitrator is authorized to issue subpoenas and award commissions
to permit depositions to be taken. Except as required by applicable Laws
(including, without limitation, the laws, rules and regulations of the SEC and
The NASDAQ Stock Market), neither party, nor the arbitrator shall
disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder
without the prior Written consent of all parties (except that Company and the
Stockholder Representative may disclose the existence, content or results of
any such arbitration to the Company Holders). Adherence to this dispute
resolution process shall not limit the right of the parties hereto to obtain
any provisional remedy, including injunctive or similar relief, from any court
of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary to protect their respective
rights and interests pending arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrators shall determine the prevailing party and shall include in their
award that partys reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

(b) Except as expressly stated in Sections 1.7(d) and 10.10(a), each of the
parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
any court within the State of Delaware in connection with any matter arising
out of a claim for indemnification under Article VIII or arising out of, in
connection with, or in relation to, the interpretation, performance or breach
of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
claim based on contract, tort or 

 



-69-  statute, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and waives
and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise
have to such jurisdiction, venue and such process. If a claim or dispute
brought in accordance herewith is resolved in the favor of a party hereto,
such party shall be entitled to, and shall be awarded, its costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the resolution of such claim or dispute (including
reasonable attorneys fees).

10.11  _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

10.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO,
ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.13 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees, and
Affiliates that the Acquired Companies and the Company Holders are clients of
Cooley LLP (" _Firm_ "). After the Closing, it is possible that Firm will
represent the Company Holders and/or the Stockholder Representative
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") solely in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any claim for indemnification against the
Company Holders. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the Acquired Companies
hereby agree that Firm (or any successor) may represent the Seller Group in
the future solely in connection with issues that may arise under this
Agreement and any claims that may be made thereunder pursuant to this
Agreement, including a dispute that arises after the Closing between Parent
(and/or Company) and Stockholder Representative, even though the interests of
Stockholder Representative may be directly adverse to Parent or the Acquired
Companies, and even though the Firm may have represented the Acquired
Companies in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be handling
ongoing matters for the Acquired Companies. Firm (or any successor) may serve
as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller Group or any director, member,
partner, officer, employee, Representative, or Affiliate of the Seller Group,
solely in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto consents thereto, and waives any
conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such party shall cause any
Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from
such representation. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that such consent
and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the
parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in
this connection.

(b) Each of Parent and Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product
protection and expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of the
Firms representation of the Acquired Companies solely in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all information and documents
covered by such privilege or protection shall, after the Effective Time,
belong to and be controlled solely by the Stockholder Representative, on
behalf of the Company Holders, and may only be waived by the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Company Holders. Following the Effective
Time, Parent

 



-70-  and Company agree that they will not request from the Firm, the Stockholder
Representative or the Company Holders any of the communications between the
Firm, on the one hand, and Company and/or the Company Holders, on the other
hand, solely relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Communications_ "), including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to
any claim in connection with any claim by Parent or any other Indemnified
Party under Article VIII; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained herein
shall prevent Parent from requesting any Communications in connection with
document production requests or discovery in any proceeding so long as such
Communications would not be subject to an attorney-client privilege if they
were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party and such
Communications are produced or required to be produced in response to such
document production requests or discovery. Following the Effective Time, the
Stockholder Representative and the Company Holders shall be permitted to use
the Communications with respect to any claim in connection with the defense of
any claim by Parent or any other Indemnified Party under Article VIII;
_provided_ that such use does not waive any applicable privileges or
protections that can or may be asserted to prevent disclosure of any
Communications to any third party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 10.13 or in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any
applicable privileges or protections that can or may be asserted to prevent
disclosure of any Communications to any third party, and neither the
Stockholder Representative nor any Company Holder shall take any action, or
cause the Firm to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to waive
any such privilege or protection to any third party.
