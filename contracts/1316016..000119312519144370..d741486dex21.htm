AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of May 6, 2019, by and among: MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD., a Bermuda
exempted company (" _Parent_ "); ANTIGUA ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "); and
AQUANTIA CORP., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

 

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub
into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with this Agreement and the
DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

B. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement and the Merger.

 

C. In order to induce Parent to enter into this Agreement and cause the Merger
to be consummated, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement: (i) each stockholder of the Company listed in _Part 1_ of _Exhibit
B_ is executing a voting and support agreement in favor of Parent (each such
agreement, a " _Support Agreement_ "); and (ii) each individual listed in
_Part 2_ of _Exhibit B_ is executing a noncompetition and non-solicitation
agreement in favor of the Company and Parent, which shall become effective at
the Effective Time.

AGREEMENT

 

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

Section 1\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

 

1.1 Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease. The Company will continue as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

1.2 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

1.3 Closing; Effective Time. The consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Hogan
Lovells US LLP, 4085 Campbell Avenue, Suite 100, Menlo Park, California, 94025
(or, at Parents election, by means of a virtual closing through electronic
exchange of signatures) at 8:00 a.m. (California Time) on a Business Day to be
mutually agreed by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the
third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7_ (other than those conditions set forth in _Sections 6.4_
and  _7.4,_ which are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions), or at such other place,
time or date as Parent and the Company may jointly designate. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, if the
Closing would otherwise be required to occur under this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_
during the last 15 days of any fiscal quarter of Parent, then Parent may
elect, by delivering a written notice to the Company at least one Business
Day prior to the date on which the Closing would otherwise be required to
occur, to delay the Closing until the second Business Day of the following
fiscal quarter of Parent. If Parent so elects to delay the Closing, then each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, effective as of the date the
Closing would otherwise be required to occur, (a) deliver the certificates
required to be delivered pursuant to _Sections 6.4_ and _7.4_ , as
applicable, and (b) irrevocably waive in

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 writing each of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ (other than
_Section_ __ _ 6.7_) and _Section_ __ _ 7_ (other than  _Section_ __ _
7.6_), as applicable. The date on which the Closing actually takes place is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of
the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company in connection with the Closing
and, concurrently with or as soon as practicable following the Closing on the
Closing Date, filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at the time of the filing of such certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later
time as may be mutually agreed by Parent and the Company and specified in
such certificate of merger (the time at which the Merger becomes effective
being referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers. Unless
otherwise mutually agreed by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time:

 

(a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to  _Exhibit C_ ;

(b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as
of the Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the respective individuals who are the directors
and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

1.5 Conversion of Shares.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be unaffected by the Merger and shall remain outstanding as an equal
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company (or held in the
Companys treasury) or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of this  _Section_ __ _
1.5(a)_ and subject to _Sections 1.5(b)_ , _1.7_ and _1.8_ , each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive $13.25 in cash (such cash amount, as
it may be adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_, the " _Price Per
Share_ "), without interest; and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time constitute Company Restricted Stock, then: (i) the Price
Per Share payable in exchange for each such share of Company Restricted Stock
will be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other conditions applicable to such Company Restricted Stock;
and (ii) such consideration need not be paid until such time as such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses or otherwise
terminates. Prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all action that may be

 



2

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 reasonably necessary, including obtaining all reasonably necessary Consents,
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to
exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such
Company Restricted Stock purchase agreement or other Contract with respect to
such unvested consideration.

 

(c) If, during the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending
at the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are
changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock
split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, or if a stock dividend is declared by the Company during
such period, or a record date with respect to any such event shall occur
during such period, then the consideration to be paid in respect of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(iii)_ shall be
adjusted to the extent appropriate.

 

1.6 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a)
except for shares of Company Common Stock that continue to be held by a
Subsidiary of the Company in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)(i)_, all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
all holders of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such certificate,
a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") or uncertificated shares of Company Common
Stock represented by book entry (each such share, an " _Uncertificated Share_
") shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company; and (b) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made
on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share is presented
to the Paying Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be canceled and shall
be exchanged as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_.

 

1.7 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or
trust company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ").
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.8_, Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause
to be deposited with the Paying Agent promptly after the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, but in no event later than one Business Day following the
Closing Date, cash sufficient to make payments of the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, other than payments of the Merger
Consideration that may become payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_
(the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided, however_ , that any such investments
shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with maturities of no
more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States. No investment of the Payment Fund shall
relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly
making the payments required by this _Section_ __ _ 1_, and following any
losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional cash
funds to the Paying Agent in the amount of such losses to the extent the
funds in the Payment Fund are insufficient for such purposes, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund. Following the Effective
Time, Parent shall retain cash sufficient to make, or cause to be made,
payments of the Merger Consideration payable to the former holders of Company
Restricted Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_ in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent will mail to the
Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company
Stock Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent);
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in exchange for Merger
Consideration. The form and substance of such letter of

 



3

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 transmittal and instructions shall be as reasonably agreed to by Parent and
the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Paying Agent for exchange (or compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for transfer of
Uncertificated Shares), together with the delivery of a duly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
cash consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares; and (B) the Company Stock
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered or transferred shall be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company
Common Stock which are not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment of Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder
in whose name the Company Stock Certificate formerly representing such shares
or Uncertificated Shares is registered if: (1) any such Company Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer; and (2) such holder shall have paid any fiduciary or surety bonds
and any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
such Merger Consideration to a Person other than such holder (or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such bonds and Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable). Until surrendered or transferred as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 1.7(b)_, each Company Stock Certificate
and each Uncertificated Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Company
Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a
bond (in such sum as Parent may direct) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Company Stock Certificates or in respect of Uncertificated Shares.

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to former
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the date that is 180 days
after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to
Parent upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock Certificates, or
complied with the procedures established by the Paying Agent for transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger
Consideration.

(d) Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock or any Company Equity Award such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld from such consideration under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Body, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(e) If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered, or any
Uncertificated Share has not been transferred, by the earlier of: (i) the
fifth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective; and (ii)
the date immediately prior to the date on which the cash amount that such
Company Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Share represents the right
to receive would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body, then such cash amount shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to
any other Person with respect to any Merger

 Consideration delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement.

 

1.8 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a proper demand
for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who has otherwise complied with all applicable
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.5_, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to
a holder of Dissenting Shares.

 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then such shares shall be deemed automatically to
have been converted into, as of the Effective Time, and to represent only, the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5_,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate
representing such shares or, if such shares are Uncertificated Shares, upon
compliance with the procedures established by the Paying Agent for the
transfer of such Uncertificated Shares.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demand for
appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior
to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument
unless Parent shall have given its prior written consent to such payment or
settlement offer.

1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action consistent with the terms of this Agreement is determined by Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of
the Company or otherwise) to take such action.

Section 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it
being understood that each representation and warranty contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 2_ is subject to: (a) the exceptions and disclosures set forth
in the Disclosure Schedule (subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.6_); and (b)
disclosure in any Company SEC Report filed with the SEC at least three

vulnerability scans of all Company Technology and those tests and scans were

recording device of which the user or customer is not made aware, "back door,"
"drop dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as such

system or network or other device on which such code is stored or installed;

received or controlled by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies. In
each of the past five calendar years, each Acquired Company has performed
a security risk assessment in accordance with industry standards and
addressed and fully remediated all threats and deficiencies identified in
those security risk assessments.

Protected Information in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions, complies with each of the Acquired Companies applicable privacy
notices and policies and with all applicable Information Privacy and Security
Laws, in each case in all material respects. Each Acquired Company will

(h) _Part 2.16(h)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and
complete list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each material Company
Employee Plan and each material Company Employee Agreement and separately
identifies each material Foreign Plan. None of the Acquired Companies has
committed in writing to establish or enter into any new arrangement that
would constitute a material Company Employee Plan or Company Employee
Agreement, or to materially modify any material Company Employee Plan or
Company Employee Agreement (except to conform any such Company Employee Plan
or Company Employee Agreement to the requirements of any applicable Legal
Requirements). The Company has Made Available to Parent, in each case, to the
extent applicable: (i) accurate and complete copies of all documents setting
forth the terms of each material Company Employee Plan and each material
Company Employee Agreement, including all amendments thereto and all related
trust documents; (ii) the most recent summary plan description, together with
summaries of the material modifications thereto, if any, required under ERISA
with respect to each material Company Employee Plan; (iii) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts and funding agreements; (iv) all
discrimination tests required under the Code for each Company Employee Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code for the most recent
plan year; and (v) the most recent IRS determination or opinion letter issued
with respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code.

(i) Each Company Employee Plan has been established, maintained and operated
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including ERISA
and the Code. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code and each trust intended to be qualified under Section
501(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable determination letter (or opinion
letter, if applicable) as to its qualified status under the Code and, to the
knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
such qualification. Each Company Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified
under applicable Legal Requirements is so tax qualified, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and no circumstance or
condition exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any such Company Employee Plan. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Closing in
accordance with its terms. There is no audit, inquiry or Legal Proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or reasonably
anticipated by the IRS, DOL or any other Governmental Body with respect to
any Company Employee Plan. None of the Acquired Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate has ever incurred any material penalty or Tax with respect to any
Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through
4980 of the Code. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability, each of the Acquired
Companies and ERISA Affiliates have timely made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan,
and, to the extent not yet due, such contributions and other payments have
been adequately accrued in the consolidated financial statements (including
any related notes) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Reports. Each Foreign Plan that is required to be registered or approved by
any Governmental Body under applicable Legal Requirements has been so
registered or approved, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Liability that is, or would reasonably be expected
to be, material to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

 

(j) None of the Acquired Companies, and no ERISA Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to, or has within the past six years ever maintained,

Plan subject to

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA; or (iii) plan described in
Section 413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association"
within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Company Employee Plan
subject to ERISA holds stock issued by the Company or any of its current
ERISA Affiliates as a plan asset. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a Liability that is, or would reasonably be expected to
be, material to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole, the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the Liability of each insurer
for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or the book reserve established
for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient
to procure or provide in full for the accrued benefit obligations (determined
on an ongoing basis accrued to the date of this Agreement), with respect to
all current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the
reasonable actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to
determine employer contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan,
and none of the Contemplated Transactions will cause any such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

(k) No Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement provides
(except at no cost to the Acquired Companies or any Affiliate of any Acquired
Company), or reflects or represents any Liability of any of the Acquired
Companies or any Affiliate of any Acquired Company to provide, post-
termination or retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health
benefits or other post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any
Person for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(l) Except as set forth in _Part 2.16(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, and
except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions will (either alone or in combination with another event, whether
contingent or otherwise): (i) result in any payment (whether of bonus, change
in control, retention, severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any Company Associate; or (ii) create
any limitation or restriction on the right of any Acquired Company to merge,
amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or Company Employee Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount payable to any
Company Associate as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the consummation of any of the Contemplated Transactions (either alone or
in combination with any other event) would be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G or would be nondeductible under Section
280G of the Code. None of the Acquired Companies has any obligation to
compensate any Company Associate for any Taxes incurred by such Company
Associate under Section 4999 of the Code.

(m) Except as listed on _Part 2.16(m)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, each
Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement or other Contract between
any Acquired Company and any Company Associate that is a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" subject to Section 409A is and has at all times
been administered in documentary and operational compliance with the
requirements of Section 409A, except as would not result in a material
Liability. No Acquired Company has any obligation to gross-up or otherwise
reimburse any Company Associate for any tax incurred by such person pursuant
to Section 409A.

condition, fact or circumstance or (B) such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement; (iv) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company that,

or circumstance that would make the timely satisfaction of any of the

(a) The Company shall not (and shall not resolve or publicly propose to)
directly or indirectly, and shall ensure that the other Acquired Companies do

and their Representatives acting on Parents behalf): (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage, assist, knowingly induce or knowingly facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry (including by approving any transaction, or approving any Person

Inquiry; (ii) furnish or otherwise provide access to any information regarding

any Person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition
Proposal that is submitted to the Company after the date of this Agreement by
such Person (and not withdrawn) if: (i) none of the Acquired Companies or any
of their respective Representatives shall have materially breached any of the
provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.3_; (ii) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account the advice
of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
the Companys outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer;
(iii) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent

Delaware law; (iv) at least two Business Days prior to furnishing any such
non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person, the Company: (A) gives Parent written notice of the

and (B) receives from such Person, and delivers to Parent a copy of, an
executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use
and disclosure of all non-public written and oral information furnished to
such Person by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies, "standstill" provisions
no less favorable to the Company than the "standstill" provisions contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement and other provisions no less favorable to the
Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (it being understood
that, for purposes of this clause "(B)" only, the amendment to the
Confidentiality Agreement referred to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)_ shall be
disregarded); and (v) at least 24 hours prior to furnishing any non-public
information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been previously
furnished by the Company to Parent).

Acquired Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Inquiry,
or receives any request for non-public

 information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Inquiry, at any time during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Company
shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or any such request): (i) advise
Parent both orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition
Inquiry or request (including the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions thereof); and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all
documents and communications received by any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company setting forth the terms and conditions
of, or otherwise relating to, such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry

current basis, with respect to the status of any such Acquisition Proposal,
Acquisition Inquiry or request and any modification or proposed modification
thereto, and shall (A) promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) notify
Parent if it intends to provide non-public information in connection with, or
to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning, such Acquisition
Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request and (B) promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after transmittal or receipt of any correspondence or
communication) provide Parent with a copy of any correspondence or
communication between or otherwise involving (1) any Acquired Company or any
Representative of any Acquired Company and (2) the Person that made or
submitted such Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Inquiry or request or any
Representative of such Person. As and to the extent required by  _Section_ __
_ 4.3(b)(v)_, the Company shall provide Parent with 24 hours prior notice
(or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the board of
directors of the Company) of any meeting of the board of directors of the
Company at which the board is expected to consider providing non-public
information to any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry.

 

(d) The Company shall, and shall ensure that each of the other Acquired

their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitation or encouragement of, or discussions or
negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry.

(e) The Company: (i) agrees that it will not, and it shall ensure that none of
the other Acquired Companies will, release or permit the release of any
Person from, or amend, waive or permit the amendment or waiver of any
provision of, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no-hire, "standstill" or
similar agreement or provision to which any of the Acquired Companies is or
becomes a party or under which any of the Acquired Companies has or acquires
any rights; and (ii) will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such agreement or provision at the request of Parent (it
being understood that such reasonable efforts will require the Company to
pursue litigation against any Person that breaches any "standstill" provision
or other "deal protection" provision in any such agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (except as expressly set forth in the immediately preceding
parenthetical) such reasonable efforts will not require the Company to pursue
any litigation; and _provided, further_ , that the Company may release a
Person from, or amend or waive any provision of, any "standstill" agreement or
provision if: (A) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith,
after having taken into account the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to release such Person from such agreement or
provision or the failure to amend such agreement or waive such provision
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; and

the members of the Companys board of directors) of any meeting of the
Companys board of directors at which such board of directors will consider
and determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, with a
written notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for
holding such meeting, the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal
that is the basis of the potential action by the Companys board of directors
(including a copy of any draft Contract relating to such Acquisition Proposal)
and the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; (D) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into
account the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer; (E) the Companys
board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken into account
the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Offer, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, or the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ in order to accept such Superior Offer,
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (F)
no less than four Business Days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company
Board Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(i)_ in order to accept such Superior Offer, the Companys board of
directors delivers to Parent a written notice (a

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (1) stating that the Company has
received a Superior Offer that did not result directly or indirectly from a
material breach of any of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ or _Section_
__ _ 5.2_ or the Confidentiality Agreement, (2) stating that the Companys
board of directors intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board

Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice, the Companys board of directors
has not withdrawn or modified the Company Board Recommendation and the
Company has not attempted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.1(i)_; (H) throughout such four Business Day period, the Company engages
(to the extent requested by Parent) in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement in such a manner that the failure to withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation, or the failure to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ in order to accept such Superior Offer,
would not reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
obligations of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Delaware law; and (I) at the time of withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ in order to accept such Superior
Offer, the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
taking into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation, or the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_ in order to accept such Superior Offer, would still
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of
the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Delaware law in light of such Superior Offer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that when making such determination, the Companys board of
directors shall be obligated to consider any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by
clause "(H)" above or otherwise; or

 

(ii) if: (A) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a
material event, material development or change in circumstances that relates
to and is material to the Acquired Companies (taken as a whole) (but does not
relate to any Acquisition Proposal) that was not known, and would not
reasonably be expected to have been known or foreseen, by any of the Acquired
Companies on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of
which were not known, and would not reasonably be expected to have been known
or foreseen, by any of the Acquired Companies as of the date of this
Agreement), which event, development or change in circumstance, or any
material consequence thereof, becomes known to any of the Acquired Companies
prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder
Vote and did not result from or arise out of the announcement or pendency of,
or any action required to be taken (or to be refrained from being taken)
pursuant to, this Agreement (any such material event, material development or
material change in circumstances being referred to as a " _Change in
Circumstances_ "); (B) the Company provides Parent with 48 hours prior
written notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of
the Companys board of directors) of any meeting of the Companys board of
directors at which such board of directors will consider and determine whether
such Change in Circumstances requires the Companys board of directors to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation, with a written notice
specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such
meeting and a reasonably detailed description of such Change in Circumstances;
(C) the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after
having taken into account the advice of an independent financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, the failure to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Companys stockholders under applicable Delaware law; (D) no less than four
Business Days prior to withdrawing or modifying the Company Board
Recommendation, the Companys board of directors delivers to Parent a written
notice (1) stating that a Change in Circumstances has arisen, (2) stating that
it intends to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in light of
such Change in Circumstances and describing any intended modification of the
Company Board Recommendation and (3) containing a reasonably detailed
description of such Change in Circumstances; (E) throughout such four Business
Day period, the Company engages (to the extent requested by Parent) in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would not
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations
of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Delaware law in light of such Change in Circumstances; and (F) at
the time of withdrawing or modifying the Company Board Recommendation,
the Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after taking into
account the advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation would
still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations
of the Companys board of directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Delaware law in light of such Change in Circumstances; _provided_
, _however_ , that when making such determination, the Companys board of
directors shall be obligated to consider any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent as a result of the negotiations required by

5.2(d),_ any change in the form or amount of the consideration payable in
connection with a Superior Offer, and any other material change to any of the
terms of a Superior Offer, will be deemed to be a new Superior Offer,
requiring a new Recommendation Change Notice and a new advance notice period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the advance notice period applicable to any such
change to a Superior Offer pursuant to clause "(i)(F)" of the first sentence
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ shall be two Business Days rather than four
Business Days. The Company agrees to keep confidential, and not to disclose to
the public or to any Person, other than the Companys Representatives, any
and all information regarding any negotiations that take place pursuant to
clause "(i)(H)" or clause "(ii)(E)" of the first sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2(d)_ (including the existence and terms of any proposal made on behalf
of Parent or the Company during such negotiations), unless (aa) the disclosure
of such information is required by applicable Legal Requirements or (bb) the
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after having taken
into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Delaware law. The Company shall ensure that any withdrawal or
modification of the Company Board Recommendation: (x) does not change or
otherwise affect the approval of this Agreement or any of the Support
Agreements by the Companys board of directors for purposes of Section 203 of
the DGCL; and (y) does not have the effect of causing any corporate Takeover
Statute of the State of Delaware or any other state to be applicable to this
Agreement or any of the Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ or elsewhere in this

counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Delaware law; _provided, however_ , that this _Section_ __ _
5.2(e)_ shall not be deemed to permit the Companys board of directors to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub or take any of the actions referred to in _Section_ __ _
5.2(c)_ except, in the case of a withdrawal or modification of the Company
Board Recommendation, to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of each of clauses "(i)" and "(ii)"
above, any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication
or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act, shall be deemed to be a

 withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent and Merger Sub unless the Companys board of directors
publicly and unanimously reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure.

(f) Subject to the Companys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_, the Companys obligation to call, give notice of
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section_ __ _

5.3 Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other Person, each In the Money Option that is vested (after
giving effect to any applicable terms of vesting acceleration) and held by a
Person who is not a Continuing Employee (each, a " _Cash-Out Option_") shall
be canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive (subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, or other amounts
required by applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Cash-Out Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess of (A)
the Price Per Share _over_ (B) the per share exercise price for the Company
Common Stock subject to such Cash-Out Option. Following the Effective Time,
any such canceled Cash-Out Option shall entitle the former holder of such
Cash-Out Option only to the payment described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_,
which shall be made by the Surviving Corporation within 10 Business Days after
the Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or any other Person, each In the Money Option
that is held by a Continuing Employee, whether vested or unvested, shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into an option to purchase, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option (including
any provisions with respect to the acceleration of vesting following the
Effective Time), that number of Parent Common Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Conversion Ratio, at an exercise price per Parent Common Share (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ (A) the
per share exercise price for the Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, _by_ (B) the Conversion Ratio (each such assumed Company Option, as so
adjusted, a " _Converted Option_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, following
the Effective Time, all references to the "Company" in each Company Equity
Plan and each award agreement shall be deemed to be references to Parent. The
assumption and conversion of Converted Options contemplated by this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ shall in each case be effected in a manner intended to
comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other Person, each Out of the Money Option and each In the
Money Option that is unvested (after giving effect to any applicable terms of
vesting acceleration) and held by a Person who is not a Continuing Employee
shall be canceled and extinguished for no consideration.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other Person, each Company RSU that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
applicable terms of vesting acceleration) and held by a Continuing Employee
shall be converted into that number of Parent restricted stock units,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Conversion Ratio (each such assumed Company RSU, as
so adjusted, a " _Converted RSU_ "). Any

 



40

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Converted RSU issued pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_ shall be
subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company
RSU prior to the Effective Time (including any provisions with respect to the
acceleration of vesting following the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_
, that all references to the "Company" in each Company Equity Plan and each
award agreement shall be deemed to be references to Parent.

(e) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other Person, each Company RSU that is outstanding and
unvested (after giving effect to any applicable terms of vesting acceleration)
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Person who is not a
Continuing Employee shall be canceled and extinguished for no consideration.

(f) At the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of Parent, the
Company or any other Person, each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested
(and with respect to which shares of Company Common Stock have not yet been
issued) immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
applicable terms of vesting acceleration and including those Company RSUs
that become vested immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time) shall be
canceled and extinguished, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
(subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, or other amounts required by
applicable Legal Requirements to be withheld) an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the Price Per Share, _multiplied by_ (ii) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU. Following the
Effective Time, any such canceled Company RSU shall entitle the former holder
of such Company RSU only to the payment described in this _Section_ __ _
5.3(f)_, which shall be made by the Surviving Corporation within 10 Business
Days after the Effective Time or at such other time or times following the
Effective Time consistent with the terms of the Company RSU to the extent
necessary to avoid the imposition of additional income Tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if a
Company Equity Award is subject to the Legal Requirements of a non-U.S.
jurisdiction and Parent determines that such Company Equity Award may not be
subject to the treatment set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, _Section_ __
_ 5.3(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 5.3(d)_, _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_, as applicable, under the applicable

reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company at least 20 calendar days
prior to the Effective Time.

and each Director RSU that is then outstanding and unvested shall be vested in
full.

 

(i) The amount of cash, if any, that a holder of a Company Equity Award is
entitled to receive with respect to such Company Equity Award pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_ shall be rounded down to
the nearest cent (with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after
aggregating the cash amounts payable for all Company Equity Awards held by
such holder pursuant to _Sections_ _5.3(a)_ and _5.3(f)_.

(j) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall take
all actions necessary (including obtaining any required consents) to
effectuate the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such action taken shall be required to be irrevocable
until immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees to file, as soon
as reasonably practicable but in no event later than ten Business Days after
the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for
use by Parent) with respect to the Parent Common Shares issuable with respect
to Converted Options and Converted RSUs, in each case that are eligible to be
registered on Form S-8, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as the Converted Options and Converted RSUs assumed in accordance with
this Agreement remain outstanding.

 

5.4 Treatment of Company ESPP. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all action that may be necessary to provide
that: (w) no new offering period (or similar

 



41

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 period during which shares may be purchased) shall commence under the ESPP
following the commencement of the offering period scheduled to commence on May
15, 2019 (the " _Final Offering Period_ ") (it being understood and agreed
that the offering period scheduled to commence on May 15, 2019 shall have a
maximum duration of six months); (x) participants in the ESPP as of the date
of this Agreement may not increase their payroll deductions under the ESPP
from those in effect at the commencement of the Final Offering Period; (y) no
new participants may commence participation in the ESPP following the
commencement of the Final Offering Period; and (z) the Final Offering Period
may not be extended beyond its original six month duration. Without limiting
the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement (but in any event prior to the Closing), the Company shall
take such action as may be necessary to: (i) cause the Final Offering Period
(or similar period during which shares may be purchased) to be the final
offering period under the ESPP and to be terminated no later than three
Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Final_ _Exercise
Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the ESPP; (iii) cause
each participants then-outstanding share purchase right under the ESPP (the
" _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; and
(iv) terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the Final Exercise Date,
the funds credited as of such date under the ESPP within the associated
accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the ESPP
shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of the ESPP (as amended pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_), and
each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the
Price Per Share in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, subject to
withholding of any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. Any
accumulated contributions of each participant under the ESPP as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ESPP (as amended pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_), be refunded to such participant as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). No further
Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP after the
Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to participants
of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and the termination of the ESPP in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

5.5 Treatment of Company Warrants.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall properly provide timely prior
written notice of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Contemplated
Transactions to the holders of the Warrants in accordance with the terms of
the Warrants.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but no later
than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Warrants to be amended to provide that the Warrants shall be canceled,
terminated and extinguished without consideration at the Effective Time and
that, from and after the Effective Time, the holders of the Warrants shall
have no rights with respect thereto. Each such amendment shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and shall be subject to advance
review and reasonable approval by Parent.

 

5.6 Employee Benefits.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, and in addition to
the applicable Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain, for each employee of the
Acquired Companies who continues in employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, base salary at a level that is no
less favorable than the base salary provided to such employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or the applicable Parent Subsidiary, to honor and abide by the

(b) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) following the Effective Time and in which any of the Continuing
Employees participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), and except to the extent
necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting, service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past
service credit under its benefit plans) shall, to the extent permitted by the
terms of the applicable Parent Plan, be treated as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Each applicable Parent Plan shall, to the extent permitted by
the terms of the applicable Parent Plan, waive eligibility waiting periods
and pre-existing condition limitations to the extent waived or not included
under the corresponding Company Employee Plan. To the extent permitted under
the applicable Parent Plan, Parent agrees to give or cause its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to give the Continuing Employees credit
under the applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid prior to the Effective Time
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under a
corresponding Company Employee Plan for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.

 

(c) Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees located in the U.S. shall be
eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and
welfare benefit plans, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of
such plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
5.6(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall: (i) be construed to create a
right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent; (ii) be deemed to establish,
amend, modify or cause to be adopted any Company Employee Plan or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates; or
(iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates from establishing, amending, modifying or
terminating any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time
assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, in each case,
following the Effective Time. Except for Indemnified Persons to the extent of
their rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.7_, no Company Associate shall be
deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. Nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ shall limit the effect of _Section_ __ _ 9.8_.

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the
day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company
Employee Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify
under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company
is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall
provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption
by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination
of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which shall be subject
to the prior review and reasonable approval of Parent), effective no later
than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective. The
Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such
Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request.

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions (as reasonably determined by the Company, based on its outside
counsels advice), the Company shall consult with Parent and shall ensure
that such notification or consultation requirements are complied with prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall,
at Parents request, reasonably cooperate with Parent in communications with
Continuing Employees regarding post-Closing employment matters, including
post-Closing employee benefits and compensation or other compensation or
benefits matters related to or impacted by any of the Contemplated
Transactions (whether alone or in combination with additional events),
including the matters described in this _Section_ __ _  5.6_.

5.7 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in favor of those
Persons who are directors and officers of any Acquired Company (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and omissions as

 



43

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in
the Companys or the applicable Acquired Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and
as provided in those indemnification agreements between an Acquired Company
and such Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
Made Available to Parent, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect (to the extent such rights to indemnification are available
under and consistent with applicable Delaware law) for a period of six years
from the date on which the Merger becomes effective.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and
officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as of
the date of this Agreement in the form Made Available to Parent (the "
_Existing D andO Policy_"), to the extent that such directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms;
_provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute
for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums
for the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of 300%
of the annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement by the Company
for the Existing DandO Policy (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If any future annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the
Maximum Premium in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or
any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a
premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Parent and the Surviving Corporation or,
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to purchase a
pre-paid, non-cancellable "tail" policy on the Existing DandO Policy for a
claims reporting or discovery period of six years from the Effective Time and
otherwise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than the terms
and conditions of the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to, and the
Company shall not (without the prior written consent of Parent), expend an
amount for such "tail" policy in excess of the Maximum Premium. If such "tail"
policy is purchased, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons, who
are intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ from and
after the Effective Time.

 

5.8 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

 

(a) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to use their reasonable best efforts, to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to
submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental
Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent
shall: (i) as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than 10 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file the notifications
required under the HSR Act; (ii) respond as promptly as practicable to (A) any
inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and (B) any
inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign
antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or
related matters; (iii) engage in pre-filing discussions with CFIUS, as deemed
advisable by Parent; (iv) as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement prepare and file with CFIUS a declaration pursuant to 31 C.F.R.
§ 801.402(a), which declaration shall state that if the action taken by CFIUS
at the end of the declaration assessment period satisfies the CFIUS Condition,
then the parties intend to consummate the Merger promptly after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6_ and _Section_ __ _ 7_, (v) if, at
the conclusion of the 30-day declaration assessment period described in 31
C.F.R. § 801.404, the CFIUS Condition has not been

 



44

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 satisfied, then Parent and the Company shall forgo the submission of an
initial draft of the Joint Voluntary Notice to CFIUS pursuant to 31 C.F.R. §
800.401(f), unless CFIUS specifically requests such a draft, and shall
promptly prepare and submit a formal Joint Voluntary Notice to CFIUS pursuant
to 31 C.F.R. § 800.401(a); and (vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable, and no later than the deadline specified
by CFIUS for such a response, to any information request from CFIUS in
connection with the CFIUS assessment, review or investigation of the Merger.
The Company and Parent agree that if CFIUS suggests or requests, or if Parent
determines it to be reasonably appropriate in connection with satisfying the
CFIUS Condition, that the parties withdraw and resubmit the declaration
described in clause "(iv)" above or the Joint Voluntary Notice submitted to
CFIUS pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in withdrawing and resubmitting such declaration or Joint Voluntary
Notice.

 

(b) Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, Parent and the Company each shall promptly supply the other with
any information which may be required in order to effectuate any filings
(including applications) pursuant to (and to otherwise comply with its
obligations set forth in) _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement, Parent: (i) shall have the principal responsibility for
devising and implementing the strategy of the parties with respect to seeking
any actions or Consents of any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger
and coordinating any contacts with any Governmental Body; and (ii) shall take
the lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Body in
connection with obtaining any such action or Consent. Except where prohibited
by applicable Legal Requirements or any Governmental Body, and subject to the
immediately preceding sentence and the confidentiality provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall: (A) consult
with the other in good faith prior to taking a position with respect to any
filing or submission required by _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_; (B) permit the other
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, white papers, arguments, opinions or proposals before making or
submitting any of the foregoing to any Governmental Body by or on behalf of
any party hereto in connection with any filing or submission required by
_Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_ or any antitrust-related Legal Proceeding related to
this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions; (C) coordinate with the
other in preparing and exchanging such information; and (D) promptly provide

presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers, opinions, proposals and other
submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made or submitted by
such party with or to any Governmental Body in connection with any filing or
submission required by _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_. 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall notify the other promptly upon the
receipt of: (i) any communication from any official of any Governmental Body
in connection with any filing or submission made pursuant to this Agreement;

Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger or
any of the other Contemplated Transactions (and shall keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or threat); and (iii)
any request by any official of any Governmental Body for any amendment
or supplement to any filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any
information required to comply with any Legal Requirement applicable to the
Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions. Whenever any event

use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated

_ 5.8(e)_, each party to this Agreement: (i) shall make all filings (if any),

Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal

have any obligation under this Agreement to (and none of the Acquired
Companies shall, except with the prior written consent of Parent, agree to):
(i) propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition, holding separate or
license (or similar arrangement) of, or limit Parents freedom of action with

Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the Acquired Companies, or
otherwise propose, proffer or agree to any other requirement, obligation,
condition, limitation or restriction on any of the businesses, product lines
or assets of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of the Acquired Companies; (ii) commence or contest, or cause any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to commence or contest, any litigation in which a
Governmental Body is a party relating to the Merger or any of the other

be expected to result in a material and negative impact on the benefits of the
Merger to Parent.

before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

the other Contemplated Transactions unless: (a) the other party shall have
approved such disclosure; or (b) such party shall have been advised by its
legal counsel that such disclosure is required by a Legal Requirement or the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange or the Parent Stock Exchange and shall
have provided the other party with reasonable advance notice of its intention
to make such disclosure and the content of such disclosure. Notwithstanding
the foregoing: (i) each of Parent and the Company may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences
and make internal announcements to employees, so long as such statements or
announcements are consistent with (and not materially expansive of) previous

made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by the other
party); (ii) Parent or the Company may, without the prior consent of the other
party, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement as may be required by a Legal Requirement or the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange or the Parent Stock Exchange if it first notifies and
consults with the other party prior to issuing any such press release or
making any such public announcement or statement and (iii) the Company need
not consult with (or obtain the consent of) Parent in connection with any
press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or any withdrawal or modification of the Company
Board Recommendation in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_.

9.10 Cooperation. The parties agree to cooperate fully with each other and to
execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and
instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by a
party to evidence or reflect the Contemplated Transactions and to carry out
the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

9.11 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to such
replacement, the parties agree that the court making the determination
referred to above shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.

9.12 Remedies. Any and all remedies in this Agreement expressly
conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement, or by law or
equity, upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy, and nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific
performance or injunctive relief. The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement required to be performed by any of the parties were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
by any party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, any
non-breaching party shall be entitled to obtain, without proof of actual
damages (and in addition to any other remedy to which such non-breaching party
may be entitled at law or in equity): (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation; and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened
breach. Each of the parties hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy.

singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
