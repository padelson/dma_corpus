 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as an

set forth in this Agreement and the provisions of the Limited Liability
Company Act of the State of Delaware (the " _DE LLC Act_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
appointed a committee of the Company Board consisting only of independent and
disinterested directors of the Company (the " _Transaction Committee_ ") to
review and negotiate, and make a recommendation to the Company Board with
respect to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the
Transaction Committee, unanimously (other than Scott Nuttall and Craig Farr,
who were not present at the meeting of the Company Board) has (i) determined
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger,
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of the Companys Common
Shares (as such term is defined in the Companys Amended and Restated
Operating Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2007 and as amended from time to time
prior to the date hereof, the " _Company Operating Agreement_ "), (ii)
approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger,
and (iii) resolved to recommend that the holders of the Companys Common
Shares approve the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the general partner of Parent (the "
_Parent Board_ "), the board of directors of Fund Holdings, and the sole
member of Merger Sub have, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein,
including the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, by virtue of the Merger, the holders of the Companys Common Shares
will receive a continuing equity interest in the Company through the ownership
of common units representing the limited partnership interests of Parent (such
common units, the " _Parent Common Units_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Closing, Parent will issue to Fund Holdings
a number of Parent Common Units that will be distributed to the holders of the
Companys Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.3 in connection with the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, each Preferred Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the

WHEREAS, the Companys 7.500% Senior Notes due March 20, 2042 and the

the Surviving Entity immediately following the Merger; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company and the Parent Parties desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of the DE LLC Act, at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
the Company shall be the surviving limited liability company in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and shall become an indirect subsidiary of
Parent.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time; Closing Date_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable on
the Closing Date, the parties shall file (or cause to be filed) with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger for the
Merger, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DE LLC Act
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DE LLC Act in connection with the Merger. The
Certificate of Merger will provide that the Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and/or time
as may be agreed by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

(b) Prior to the filing of the Certificate of Merger, a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held at 10:00 a.m., New York time, at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York
10017, or at such other place as the parties may agree in writing, (i) as soon
as practicable (but in any event within three business days) following the
date upon which all of the conditions set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions), or (ii) on such other date and/or at such other
time as the parties may agree in writing so long as all of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied or waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or waived at or prior to such
date and/or time. The date on which the Closing takes place is referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_." Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the parties agree to use
reasonable best efforts to coordinate and cooperate in taking such actions so
that the Closing will take place on the last business day of a calendar month.

 



 

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the DE LLC Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.

 



 

1.4 _Organizational Documents and Directors and Officers of the Company_. At
the Effective Time, the certificate of formation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Merger shall be the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Entity, and the limited liability company agreement of the Company
in effect immediately prior to the Merger shall be the limited liability
company agreement of the Surviving Entity; in each case, until such
organizational document is amended in accordance with Applicable Law and as
provided in such organizational document. The officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Entity. Each of the parties shall take all necessary action to cause those
individuals designated in writing by Parent three days prior to the Closing
Date to be the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Entity
immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective successors
are duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Entity and Applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 **EFFECT OF THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _Effect on Shares_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of the Company, any Parent Party or the holder of any
securities of the Company or any Parent Party:

 



 

(i) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Units_. Each common unit representing
membership interests of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Units_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Common Share of the
Surviving Entity (each such Common Share along with each Common Share of the
Surviving Entity issued pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii), a " _Surviving Company
Share_ "), such that immediately following the Effective Time, such newly
issued Surviving Company Shares shall constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Entity other than the Preferred
Shares.

 



 

(ii) _Treatment of Certain Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by
Fund Holdings or any subsidiary of Fund Holdings shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each Company
Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is held by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding and be converted into Common Shares of the Surviving Entity
representing the same percentage ownership of the Surviving Entity as such
Company Common Share represented in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Company Common Shares described in Section 2.1(a)(ii)) shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive a number of validly issued Parent Common
Units equal to the Exchange Ratio, together with cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Units, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) (collectively,
the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each Company Common Share, when so converted
pursuant to this Section 2.1(a)(iii), shall no longer be outstanding and shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist.

 



 

(b) _No Effect on Phantom Shares_. Each phantom share (the " _Phantom Shares_
") credited to a participants account under the KKR Financial Holdings LLC
Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation and Share Award Plan (the "
_Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") shall, immediately upon the Effective Time,
automatically be converted into the right to receive a number of validly
issued Parent Common Units equal to the Exchange Ratio (with fractional Parent
Common Units to be aggregated and rounded to the nearest whole unit), but
shall otherwise remain outstanding following the Effective Time and be
distributed pursuant to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan.

 



 

(c) _No Effect on Preferred Shares_. Each Preferred Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an
outstanding Preferred Share of the Surviving Entity following the Effective
Time.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange Ratio; Fractional Shares; Adjustments_ _._

 



 

(a) The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall be equal to 0.51, subject to adjustment in
accordance with Section 2.2(d).

 



 

(b) No fractional Parent Common Unit shall be issued in the Merger as a result
of the conversion provided for in Sections 2.1(a)(iii) and 2.1(b), but in lieu
thereof each Person otherwise entitled to a

 



      
 

 



 

fractional Parent Common Unit shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.2(b), a cash payment
in lieu of such fractional Parent Common Unit representing such Persons
proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange
Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) in
one or more transactions of Parent Common Units equal to the excess of (i) the
aggregate number of Parent Common Units to be delivered to the Exchange Agent
by Fund Holdings pursuant to Section 2.3(a) over (ii) the aggregate number of
whole (non-fractional) Parent Common Units to be distributed pursuant to
Section 2.3(b) (such excess being the " _Excess Units_ "), which such
proportionate interest shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable
following such transaction or transactions. The parties acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Common
Units was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Common
Units. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as
agent for the Persons that would otherwise receive fractional Parent Common
Units, shall sell the Excess Units at then prevailing market prices on the New
York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in Section 2.2(c).

 



 

(c) The sale of the Excess Units by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE at then-prevailing market prices and shall be executed in round lots
to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in
trust for the Persons that would have otherwise received fractional Parent
Common Units (the " _Common Unit Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine
the portion of the Common Unit Trust to which each such Person shall be
entitled by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the
Common Unit Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional Parent Common Unit interest to which such Person would otherwise be
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional
Parent Common Unit interests to which all such Persons would otherwise be
entitled.

 



 

(d) In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company or Parent
shall declare a stock dividend or other distribution payable in Company Common
Shares or Parent Common Units, as applicable, or securities convertible,
exercisable or exchangeable into Company Common Shares or Parent Common Units,
as applicable, or effect a stock split, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any regular
quarterly issuances of Parent Common Units made by Parent in accordance with
its quarterly exchange process) or other similar change with respect to the
Company Common Shares or Parent Common Units, as applicable, the Exchange
Ratio set forth in Section 2.2(a) shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of such dividend, distribution, stock split,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, any regular quarterly issuances of Parent Common Units
made by Parent in accordance with its quarterly exchange process) or other
similar change.

 



 

2.3 _Exchange of Shares_ _._

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, American Stock Transfer
and Trust Company, LLC (or such other commercial bank, trust company or
transfer agent that is mutually selected by Fund Holdings and the Company)
shall act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the delivery of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) and the Parent Common
Units pursuant to Section 2.1(b). At or prior to the Effective Time, Fund
Holdings shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of each Person
entitled to payment pursuant to Sections 2.1(a)(iii) and 2.1(b), for exchange
in accordance with this Section 2.3 and in accordance with an exchange agent
agreement with Fund Holdings in form and substance reasonably approved by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Parent Common Units to be
delivered pursuant to Sections 2.1(a)(iii) and 2.1(b) and (ii) an amount of
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c) (such Parent Common Units, together
with any cash for unpaid dividends or distributions, if any, with respect
thereto, are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_ _._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder, if any, of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(iii): (i) a letter of transmittal (the form and substance of
which shall have been reasonably approved by the Company prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other customary provisions as Fund Holdings may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
payable pursuant to Section 2.3(c). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor: (A) that whole number of Parent Common Units which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) in such
denominations and registered in such names as such holder may reasonably
request and (B) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Units, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, after giving effect to any required withholding tax. Any
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
surrender the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, as provided in this Article II, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax. The Surviving Entity, without any action on the part of any
such Person, shall cause the Exchange Agent to (x) issue, as of the Effective
Time, to each holder of uncertificated Company Common Shares (any such Company
Common Share, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") that whole number of Parent Common
Units that each such Person is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(iii) and (y) mail to each such Person, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a check representing the amount of cash
in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, which such Person has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Common Units, if any, and unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of the Company Shares. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered on
the transfer records of the Company, the proper whole number of Parent Common
Units, together with a check for the cash to be paid in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Units, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any,
may be issued to such transferee if all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have
been paid and, with respect to Company Common Shares represented by a
Certificate, the Certificate held by such transferee, are presented to the
Exchange Agent.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_ _._ The parties shall
coordinate so that holders of the Company Common Shares will not receive in
respect of the same calendar quarter both (i) a quarterly distribution in
respect of such holders Company Common Shares and (ii) a quarterly
distribution in respect of the Parent Common Units issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. Subject to the immediately foregoing sentence, whenever a dividend
or distribution is declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Units with a record date after the Effective Time,
such declaration shall include a dividend or distribution in respect of all
Parent Common Units issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions
declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Units
having a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Units shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder shall
surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section 2.3. Subject to the
effect of Applicable Law of the State of Delaware, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Units
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such Parent
Common Units and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may
be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with (x) a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and (y) a payment date
subsequent to surrender that are payable with respect to such Parent Common
Units, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required thereon.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares_ _._ All Parent
Common Units issued upon surrender of Certificates or cancellation of Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including any
cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares
represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Company of
Company Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

 



 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement
requirements established by the Exchange Agent, including the making of an
affidavit to that effect and, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a
bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Entity with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends
and distributions which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_ _._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed six months after the date of the mailing required by
Section 2.3(b) shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and
any holder of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Section
2.3 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for satisfaction of its
claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends and distributions which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_ _._ None of Parent, Fund Holdings, the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of
the Exchange Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any cash, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units or any dividends
or distributions with respect to whole Parent Common Units in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect
of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_ _._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, if and as directed by Fund Holdings, on a daily
basis; _provided_ , that no losses on such investment will affect the cash
payable to former holders of Company Common Shares pursuant to the provisions
of this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Fund Holdings upon termination of the Exchange
Fund pursuant to Section 2.3(f).

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity Based Awards_ _._

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holders thereof, each option (whether vested or unvested)
to purchase Company Common Shares that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the
excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Amount over (2) the exercise price per
Company Common Share subject to such Company Option as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option
Consideration shall be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than 10 business days following the
Effective Time. For purposes of this paragraph, " _Per Share Amount_ " means
the Cash Value of the number of Parent Common Units (including any fractional
Parent Common Units) that a holder of one Company Common Share would be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii) and the Exchange Ratio
described thereunder, and " _Cash Value_ " means, with respect to a Parent
Common Unit, the average closing price of a Parent Common Unit over the 10
trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing
Date. In the

 



      
 

 



 

event that any Company Option has an exercise price per Company Common Share
that is greater than the Per Share Amount, such Company Option shall be
cancelled without payment in respect thereof as of the Effective Time, without
liability to the Company, Parent or any of their affiliates.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted Company Common Share (other than
any restricted Company Common Shares held by KKR Financial Advisors) issued
and outstanding under the 2007 Share Incentive Plan for KKR Financial Holdings
LLC, as amended from time to time (the " _2007 Share Plan_ ") shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into a number of restricted Parent Common Units (having the same
terms and conditions, including applicable vesting requirements, as applied to
such restricted Company Common Share immediately prior to the Effective Time)
that a Company Common Share would be exchanged for in accordance with Section
2.1(a)(iii) (with fractional Parent Common Units to be aggregated and rounded
to the nearest whole unit), and Parent shall assume the 2007 Share Plan and
any award agreement issued thereunder pursuant to which any such restricted
Company Common Share has been granted in order to provide for the foregoing.
At the Effective Time, any restricted Company Common Shares held by KKR
Financial Advisors shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, on the one hand, and Parent and
the Parent Board, on the other hand, shall take all actions necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding_ _. _ The Company (or the Surviving Entity after the
Effective Time), Parent, the Exchange Agent and any other applicable
withholding agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and timely paid over to the applicable taxing authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT PARTIES**

 



 

In order to induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, subject to the
exceptions set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the
Company and dated as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure
Schedule_ ") (which exceptions shall specifically identify a Section to which
such exception relates, it being understood and agreed that each such
exception shall be deemed to be disclosed both under such Section and any
other Section of this Agreement (other than Section 3.5) to which it is
reasonably apparent on its face such disclosure relates) and subject to the
information disclosed by Parent in any Parent SEC Document filed during the
period from December 31, 2011 through the business day prior to the date of
this Agreement (other than in any risk factor or other cautionary or forward-
looking disclosure contained in such Parent SEC Document), the Parent Parties
represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization and Standing_. Each Parent Party is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization with all requisite power and authority
to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as
and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. Each Parent Party
is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property it owns,
leases or operates, makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction would not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Parent. Except as would not have an adverse effect on the ability
of any Parent Party to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, no Parent Party is in default of the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any provision of its organizational documents. Parent has
furnished to the Company prior to the date hereof a complete and correct copy
of the organizational documents of each Parent Party.

 



      
 

 



 

3.2 _Power and Authority_. Each Parent Party has all requisite power and
authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement and, subject to the
adoption of this Agreement by Fund Holdings in its capacity as the sole member
of Merger Sub with respect to the Merger, to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby by the Parent Parties have been duly
authorized by all requisite action on the part of each Parent Party, subject
to the adoption of this Agreement by Fund Holdings in its capacity as the sole
member of Merger Sub with respect to the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each Parent Party, and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Parent Party enforceable against such Person in
accordance with its terms except that the enforcement hereof may be limited by
(i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws,
now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Other than the adoption of
this Agreement by Fund Holdings in its capacity as the sole member of Merger
Sub with respect to the Merger, no vote of the holders of any class or series
of capital stock (or other securities) of any Parent Party is necessary to
approve the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

collectively as " _Parent Securities_ "), or (iv) outstanding obligations of
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any Parent Securities. Except (x) as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the

this Agreement by any Parent Party nor the consummation by the Parent Parties
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will:

organizational documents of any Parent Party, subject to adoption of this
Agreement by Fund Holdings in its capacity as the sole member of Merger Sub
with respect to the Merger;

Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or a material adverse effect on the
ability of any Parent Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

3.5 _No Material Adverse Effect_. _ _Since December 31, 2012 through the date
of this Agreement, there have been no Events that, individually or in the

at the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Registration Statement, except for such portions thereof that relate only to
the Company and its subsidiaries, will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

 



 

3.8 _Litigation_. _ There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding, litigation,
arbitration, mediation or investigation (an " _A__ _ction_ ") pending or, to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries

aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

require any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement so that any of such documents would not include any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, such party shall promptly advise the other
party and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the

the Registration Statement and, as required by Applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the

subsidiaries premises, properties, books, records, Contracts and documents;
provided that the foregoing shall not require any party to (i) provide access
to information or documents that, in the reasonable judgment of such party,
would (x) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege held by such
party or (y) violate any Applicable Law or any agreement to which such party
is a party. Information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of November 18, 2013, by

all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry
of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Laws
with respect to any such filing or any such transaction. Each party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required
for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party shall give the other party to this Agreement reasonable
prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. Neither party shall independently participate
in any formal meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any

inquiry without giving the other party reasonable prior notice of the meeting
or conversation and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,

meeting or participate in any such conversation. The parties will consult and

presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws. Neither party will directly

and any such Governmental Authority or its respective staff on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except that any materials concerning one partys valuation of the

internal financial information, may be redacted. Parent shall be responsible
for all filing fees under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 5.3(d), each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In
connection therewith and subject to Section 5.3(d), if any Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall cooperate to contest and resist any such Action
(through negotiation, litigation or otherwise), including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent (each an " _Order_ "), that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available
legislative action. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration or
termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Company, or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be
obligated to agree, and none of Parent, the Company, or any of their
respective subsidiaries shall agree without the other partys prior written
consent, to take any action or accept any condition, restriction, obligation
or requirement with respect to Parent, the Company, or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates or their and their respective subsidiaries or
affiliates assets if such action, condition, restriction, obligation or
requirements (i) would reasonably be expected to require Parent, the Company
or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to sell, license, transfer,
assign, lease, dispose of or hold separate any material business or assets or
(ii) would reasonably be expected to result in any material limitations on
Parent or the Company or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to own,
retain, conduct or operate all or a material portion of their respective
businesses or assets.

 



 

5.4 _Tax Treatment_ _._ The parties agree that, for U.S. federal income tax

5.5 _Public Announcements_. _ _The initial press release concerning the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint

to any Company Change of Recommendation or any action taken by the Company,
the Company Board or the Transaction Committee pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 6.6, at all times prior to the earlier of the Closing or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public
statement or comment with respect to the Merger or any of

 



      
 

 



 

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make such other public statement or comment prior to
such consultation.

 



 

5.6 _Section 16 Matters_ _. _Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and the
Company shall use all reasonable efforts to approve in advance in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and the Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP SEC No-Action Letter (January
12, 1999) any dispositions of Company Common Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Shares) or acquisitions of Parent
Common Units (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Units) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
officer or director of Parent or the Company who is subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act (or who will become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) with respect to
securities of Parent or the Company.

 



 

5.7 _Transaction Litigation_ _. _The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this
paragraph, "participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the litigation by the litigating party (to the extent the attorney-client
privilege between the litigating party and its counsel is not undermined), and
the non-litigating party may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the
litigation but will not be afforded any decision making power or other
authority over the litigation except for the settlement consent set forth
above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.7, no
consent of any Company director shall be required for the settlement of any
Action so long as such settlement (i) does not include any admission of
wrongdoing by such Company director and (ii) does not require any payment by
such Company director for which Parent (or any of its affiliates) has not
agreed to provide complete payment.

 



 

5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_ _._

non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
cause a breach of a representation or warranty contained in Article III, (ii)
any failure of a Parent Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, and (iii) any Events that, individually or in the aggregate, would
prevent the Merger from being completed on or prior to the End Date; in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii) above solely if such breach or failure would
result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b); _provided, however_ , that a failure to comply with
this Section 5.8(a) will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth
in Section 7.2(a) or (b) to be satisfied unless the underlying inaccuracy or
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b) to be satisfied; _provided, further_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8(a) shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the Company.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
cause a breach of a representation or warranty contained in Article IV, (ii)

or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, and
(iii) any Events that, individually or in the aggregate, would prevent the
Merger from being completed on or prior to the End Date; in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii) above solely if such breach or failure would result in
the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or (b); _provided, however_ , that a failure to comply with this
Section 5.8(b) will not constitute the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or (b) to be satisfied unless the underlying inaccuracy or
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or (b) to be satisfied; _provided, further_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8(b) shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available under this Agreement to Parent.

6.3 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_ _._

 



 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
Surviving Entity shall maintain in effect (i) the current provisions (or
provisions no less favorable) regarding exculpation and indemnification of
present or former officers and directors contained in the organizational
documents of each of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any agreements
of the Company and its subsidiaries with any of their respective present or
former directors and officers existing as on the date hereof that provide such
Persons rights to exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including any matters arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses incurred in advance of the
final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law; _provided_
that any Person to whom fees and expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification) to, the present and former officers and directors
of the Company against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses,
liabilities or judgments that are paid in settlement of or in connection with
any Action based in whole or in part on, relating in whole or in part to, or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was an
officer or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the

 



      
 

 



 

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent
provided or permitted under the organizational documents of the Company and
its subsidiaries and any indemnification agreement entered into between the
Company or any of its subsidiaries and such Person (representative forms of
which have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement),
in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and to the fullest
extent permitted under Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) If Parent does not elect to purchase a "tail" directors and officers
liability insurance policy for the Companys present and former officers and
directors who are covered prior to the Effective Time by the directors and
officers liability insurance currently maintained by the Company with
coverage for six years following the Effective Time, and with coverage and
amounts and terms and conditions no less favorable to the covered persons than
the existing policies of directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company, the Company may, at its option prior to the
Effective Time, purchase such a six year "tail" insurance policy; _provided_
that the Company shall not, without Parent consent, make a premium payment
for such insurance to the extent such premium exceeds 300% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for its directors and officers liability
insurance (such amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Company is
unable to obtain the "tail" insurance described in the first sentence of this
Section 6.3(b) for an amount equal to or less than the Maximum Premium, the
Company shall be entitled to obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as
possible for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium. If the Company is unable
to purchase any such "tail" insurance contemplated in the two preceding
sentences, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, at the Companys request,
purchase, and maintain in full force and effect (and honor the obligations
under), during the six-year period beginning on the date of the Effective
Time, a "tail" insurance policy from one or more insurance carriers believed
to be sound and reputable with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance of comparable coverage and amounts and containing terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the officers and directors
of the Company as the Companys existing policy or policies for the benefit of
the current and former officers and directors with a claims period of six
years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Merger Sub be required to pay more than the Maximum Premium as the aggregate
premium for such "tail" insurance policies for its entire period, in which
case Merger Sub will obtain as much comparable "tail" insurance as possible
for an amount equal to the Maximum Premium.

 



 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent, the Surviving Entity or any
of their respective successors and assigns, as applicable, shall take such
action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume all of the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.3.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each present and former officer and director
referred to in this Section 6.3 and his or her heirs and representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for or to the exclusion of, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
or be entitled to by Contract, Applicable Law or otherwise.

 



 

6.4 _Activities of Merger Sub_ _. _Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall not conduct any business or make any investments other than as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement and will not have any assets
(other than, if applicable, a de minimis amount of cash paid for the issuance
of membership interests in connection with its initial formation) or any
material liabilities.

 



 

6.5 _NYSE Listing_. _ _Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Parent Common Units issuable pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

6.6 _Company Acquisition Proposals_ _._

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(c) through Section 6.6(f), the Company agrees that,
from the date of this Agreement until the Closing or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, neither it nor
any of its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries directors, officers, employees,
agents, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate or solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiries with respect to, or
the making of a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to any Person
relating to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(iv) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal (each a " _Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "), or (v) propose publicly or agree to do any of the foregoing
relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Subject to Section 6.6(c) through Section 6.6(f), prior to the Closing,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof (including the Transaction
Committee) shall, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to any
Parent Party, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) in the event of the commencement of a tender offer
or exchange offer for any outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock
(including the Company Common Shares), fail to include in any public statement
related to such tender offer or exchange offer or this Agreement (other than
any "stop, look and listen" or similar communication) a statement that the
Company Board Recommendation has not changed or referring to the prior Company
Board Recommendation, or (iv) recommend that the holders of the Company Shares
not approve the Merger (any action described in clauses (i)-(iv) above being
referred to as a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company, the Company
Board, the Transaction Committee or any other committee of the Company Board
from complying with its disclosure obligations under Rule 14d-9 and 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
or similar communication or making any disclosure if the Company Board or the
Transaction Committee or any other committee of the Company Board determines,
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the Companys directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the State of Delaware; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such disclosure has the effect of a Company Change of
Recommendation, Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement to the
extent set forth in Section 8.1(d)(i).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Section 6.6, until the
earlier of receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, if after the date of this Agreement
the Company receives a written unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (i)
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company may take the
following actions: (A) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making
such Company Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement with provisions no less restrictive to such third
party with respect to the use or disclosure of nonpublic information than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with
the third party with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company from, at any time prior
to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, in response to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide
Company Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not
result from a breach of Sections 6.6(a)and (g), (i) terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) in order to enter into a definitive written
agreement with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal or (ii) effecting
a Company Change of Recommendation, if, prior

 



      
 

 



 

to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), (A) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that (x) failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Companys directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the State of Delaware and (y) such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, (B)
Parent shall have received written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ")
of the Companys intention to take such action at least four business days
prior to the taking of such action, and (C) the Company Board continues to
believe, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by Parent after
its receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal. Any material
amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such
Company Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and
the Company and the Company Board shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this Section 6.6(e); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
reference herein to four business days shall be deemed to be a reference to
two business days.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from, at any time
prior to, but not after, the time of the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, effecting a Company Change of Recommendation (other than in response
to the receipt of a written unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition
Proposal, which shall be subject to Section 6.6(e)) if, prior to taking such
action, the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law of the State of Delaware; _provided, however_ that (i) Parent shall have
received written notice (a " _Board Recommendation Notice_ ") of the Companys
intention to take any such action at least four business days prior to the
taking of such action and (ii) the Company Board continues to believe, after
taking into account any modifications to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are offered by Parent after its receipt of
such Board Recommendation Notice that failing to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law of the State of Delaware.

 



 

(g) The Company agrees that it and its subsidiaries will (i) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than the parties) conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal and
(ii) request that each third party that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement that relates to a Company Acquisition Proposal
(other than Parent) return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such third party by the Company or on its behalf. The Company
agrees that it and its subsidiaries will take the necessary steps to promptly
inform its and its subsidiaries Representatives of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 6.6.

 



 

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
orally notify Parent of any request for information or any inquiries,
proposals or offers relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person making such request,
inquiry, proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers and the Company shall provide to Parent written notice of
any such inquiry, proposal or offer within 24 hours of such event and copies
of any written or electronic correspondence to or from any Person making an
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed orally,
as soon as is reasonably practicable, of the status of any Company Acquisition
Proposal, including with respect to the status and terms of any such proposal
or offer and whether any such proposal or offer has been withdrawn or rejected
and the Company shall provide to Parent written notice of any such withdrawal
or rejection and copies of any written proposals or requests for information
within 24 hours. The Company also agrees to provide any information to Parent
(not previously provided to Parent) that it is providing to another Person
pursuant to this Section 6.6 at substantially the same time it provides such
information to such other Person. All information provided to Parent under
this Section 6.6 shall be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



      
 

 



 

" _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer made by any
Person other than Parent or its subsidiaries with respect to (A) a merger,
consolidation, acquisition, share exchange, business combination,
reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company, (B) any purchase of an equity interest
(including by means of a tender or exchange offer) representing an amount
equal to or greater than a 15% voting or economic interest in the Company, or
(C) any purchase of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an
amount equal to or greater than 15% of the consolidated asset value (including
only the portion of the value of the equity interests of the subsidiaries of
the Company that is actually owned directly or indirectly by the Company) or
consolidated net revenues of the Company (including only the portion of the
revenues attributable to the equity interests of the subsidiaries of the
Company that is actually owned directly or indirectly by the Company);
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of consolidated
asset value and consolidated net revenues shall include only the
unconsolidated interests in variable interest entities that are held directly
or indirectly by the Company so that the total asset value or revenues of the
entire variable interest entity is not included in such calculation.

 



 

" _Company Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal (except that references in the definition of "Company Acquisition
Proposal" to 15% shall be replaced by 50%) made after the date of this
Agreement by any Person other than Parent or its subsidiaries on terms that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and considering such factors as
the Company Board considers to be appropriate (including the timing and
likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the
Company and the holders of the Company Shares than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account any change to the
transaction proposed by Parent.

 



 

6.7 _Approvals_. Other than the Company Shareholder Approval, each of the
parties agree to obtain all requisite board of directors, shareholder and
member approvals, to the extent not obtained prior to the date of this
Agreement, required to be obtained to consummate the Merger.

 



 

6.8 _Compliance with Agreement_. Parent agrees that from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Closing, KKR Financial Advisors shall not, and Parent
shall cause KKR Financial Advisors not to, in its capacity as manager of the
Company pursuant to the Management Agreement and the Company Operating
Agreement, take any action (unless acting at the direction of the Company
Board) that would cause the Company to fail to comply in any material respect
with any of the provisions of this Agreement.

entitled, each of the parties is entitled to a decree of specific performance,
and each of the parties shall further be entitled to an injunction restraining
any violation or threatened violation of any of the provisions of this

waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy under Applicable Law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.
