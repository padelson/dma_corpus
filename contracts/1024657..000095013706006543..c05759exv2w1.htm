</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">This letter memorializes our recent discussions and mutual understanding regarding equity terms and
your continuing ownership interest in West Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We are negotiating a Merger Agreement that requires a portion of the shares that you own to be
rolled over as a continuing ownership interest. This &#147;rollover equity&#148; will be in the form of
&#147;strips&#148; of securities of the same classes that the THL and Quadrangle investors will receive at
closing as a result of their cash investments and the merger transactions. Your continuing
ownership interest will be in the amount of $250&nbsp;million (structured to be of the same classes as
in the same amounts as would apply to new cash investors in this transaction). Attached to this
letter is a more detailed description of the proposed capital structure for the recapitalized
Company.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> describes the economic terms of these Class&nbsp;L and Class&nbsp;A securities.
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> describes the management equity incentive programs (purchased stock, restricted
stock and stock options) that we intend to adopt for Tom Barker and his team. <U>Exhibit&nbsp;C</U> is
a projected opening capitalization table, as an example of what securities are likely to be issued
at closing and our anticipated relative ownership interests. We are also attaching to this letter
(as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;D</U>) a summary term sheet regarding the stockholders agreement that you, the new
sponsor group investors from THL and Quadrangle and the Company will sign at closing to supersede
prior arrangements and provide for coordination in the future.
</DIV>

agreement as described in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;D</U>.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">To effect the recapitalization contemplated by the May&nbsp;31, 2006 Merger Agreement, the Sponsors
(<I>i.e., </I>THL / Quadrangle) will establish a transitory merger subsidiary. At closing, the Sponsors
will invest up to $762.4&nbsp;million<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">1</SUP> into the transitory merger subsidiary before it is
merged with and into Omaha. Omaha will survive the merger and continue as a Delaware corporation.
Pursuant to the merger, Omaha&#146;s certificate of incorporation will be amended to provide for two
classes of common stock. In general, cash investors (i.e., the Sponsors and, to the extent they
invest cash, management) and Founders will acquire a combination of Class&nbsp;L and Class&nbsp;A shares (in
strips of eight A Shares and one L share) in exchange for cash or in respect of rollover shares.
Supplemental management equity (restricted stock and option programs) is implemented with Class&nbsp;A
shares/options only. Attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;C is an estimated capitalization table as of
closing (after giving effect to the merger, Founder rollover, and senior executive stock
purchases). General terms of these securities will be:
