 (a) _Capital Stock of Newco_. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Newco (the " _Newco Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into and become the number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Class A and Class L Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ ") calculated as described in  _Schedule 1_. As of the Effective Time, all such Newco Shares cancelled in accordance with this _Section 3.1(a)_, when so cancelled, shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing 

    ##### 

  

    

any such Newco Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
as set forth in this _Section 3.1(a)_. 

   

 (b) _Treasury Stock and Newco Owned Stock_. Each Share that is owned by the Company and held in its treasury or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and each Share that is owned by Newco or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Newco shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 Section 3.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall designate a bank or trust company that shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and, concurrently with the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit with the Paying Agent a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (i) the product of the Public Merger Consideration and the number of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (exclusive of any Dissenting Shares, Rollover Shares, Founder Shares and Shares to be cancelled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)_), _plus_ (ii) the product of the Founder Merger Consideration and the number of Founder Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Newco or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that such investments shall only be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months (it being understood that any and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to the Surviving Corporation). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Newco shall, or the Surviving Corporation shall, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_.

Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the Paying 

    ##### 

  

    

Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash, without interest, into which the Shares theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_ , and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) is registered, if such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this  _Section 3.2_, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the Shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to _Section 3.1_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
cash payable upon the surrender of any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof). Newco, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Newco or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Newco or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (c) _Surrender of Rollover Shares and Newco Shares_. At the Closing, each holder of Rollover Shares and each holder of Newco Shares shall surrender the certificates representing such Rollover Shares or Newco Shares held by such holder, and the Surviving Corporation shall issue to each such holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ or  _3.1(d)_ , as applicable. 

   

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates. At the Effective Time, (i) holders of Certificates and certificates representing Rollover Shares shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and (iii) there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or certificates representing Rollover Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall 

    ##### 

  

    

be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of
Shares (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)_, Rollover Shares and Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ and the instructions set forth in the
letter of transmittal mailed to such holders after the Effective Time shall,
after such funds have been delivered to the Surviving Corporation, look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to which
they are entitled, without interest. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Newco, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate or certificate representing Rollover Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Newco, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Newco as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such certificate, (i) the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the applicable Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(c)_ represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall issue a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as provided in _Section 3.1(d)_ represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate representing Rollover Shares.

any third party at no or minimal charge. Except as would not be material to

Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, there have been no security
breaches relating to, violations of any security policy regarding or any
unauthorized access or unauthorized use of any data used in the businesses of
Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, since January

Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the use and dissemination of any and all
data and information concerning individuals by their businesses is in
compliance with all applicable privacy policies, terms of use, customer

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.2(b)_ but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.2(c)_, if, at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal by any Person, which Takeover Proposal was made after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith (i) after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such Takeover Proposal are required by its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, (x) furnish information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal.

Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly advise Newco orally and in writing of the receipt by it or any 

    ##### 

  

    

Company Representative of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal,
offer or request with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
result in, any Takeover Proposal (in each case within 48 hours of receipt
thereof), and the Company shall provide to Newco (within such 48 hour time
frame) (i) copies of all written due diligence materials provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Takeover Proposal which
was not previously provided to Newco and (ii) at the Companys option, either
(x) a copy of all written materials provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Takeover Proposal or inquiry or (y)
a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal or inquiry. Following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall keep Newco informed on a prompt basis of the status (including any
change to the terms and conditions thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal or
inquiry. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from providing such information to Newco. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or
offer from any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act) (other than Newco and its Affiliates, but including any
proposal from the Founders in which their ownership interest in the Company
following the consummation of such proposal would increase from the interest
held by them as of the date hereof) relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or 20% or more of the Shares then outstanding,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person (other than either of the Founders) beneficially owning 20% or more of
the Shares then outstanding, and any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means
any bona fide Takeover Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
Takeover Proposal increased to 67%) that is on terms that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley) and after
taking into account all the terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders
than the transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account any
alterations to this Agreement agreed to in writing by Newco in response
thereto) and to be reasonably capable of being consummated, taking into
account all legal and regulatory aspects of the proposal, and reasonably
capable of having committed financing at the time at which the Company
executes any definitive agreement relating to such Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that, notwithstanding
the commencement of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company may continue
to engage in the activities described in _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ and _(ii)_ with
respect to any Excluded Parties, including with respect to any amended
proposal submitted by such Excluded Parties following the No-Shop Period
Start Date. 

   

 (d) Except as set forth in _Section 6.2_, neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Newco, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, modify or withdraw such recommendation if the Board of Directors or any committee thereof determines in good 

    ##### 

  

    

faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that doing so is required by
its fiduciary duties under applicable law (regardless of whether a Takeover
Proposal has been made at any time); (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Takeover Proposal; (iii)
make any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
other than a recommendation against such offer (any of the actions referred
to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), whether taken by the Board
of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "); (iv) allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar
agreement or understanding (other than a customary confidentiality agreement)
(A) constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to result in, any Takeover Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; or (v) effect any transaction contemplated by
any Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
be prohibited from terminating this Agreement and entering into an agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with  _Section
6.2(e)_. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.2_, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company has received a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof may (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, (y) terminate this Agreement (and concurrently with or after such termination, if it so chooses, cause the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal) and/or (z) exempt any Person from the restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws, including Section 203 of the DGCL; _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company or any such committee has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors or such committee is required to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, terminate this Agreement and/or exempt such Person, as the case may be, by its fiduciary duties under applicable law. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.2(e)_ unless the Company has (x) provided written notice to Newco (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") advising Newco that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal, (y) negotiated during the five calendar day period following Newcos receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal in good faith with Newco (to the extent Newco wishes to negotiate) to enable Newco to make a counteroffer so the Superior Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal and (z) terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ and complied with the provision regarding termination fees under _Section 7.5_. 

   

 (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.2_ shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel, such disclosure is required by its fiduciary duties under applicable law or is otherwise required under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Board of Directors (or any committee 

    ##### 

  

    

thereof) may make an Adverse Recommendation Change without complying with
_Sections 6.2(d)_ or _(e)_. 

   

 Section 6.3 _Conduct of Business of Newco Pending the Merger_. During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Newco shall not engage in any activity of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company, take such action as it deems necessary to cause the units representing shares of Company Common Stock that are credited to participant accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan (" _Company Stock Units_ ") to be converted, based on the Public Merger Consideration, into units representing shares of mutual funds selected by the affected participants and to transfer a cash amount of equal value to the grantor trust maintained under the Deferred Compensation Plan;  _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the approval of Newco in its sole discretion and applicable law, on or prior to the close of business on June 21, 2006, each of the Management Holders shall be permitted to elect that some or all of the Company Stock Units credited to his or her Deferred Compensation Account as of the close of business on the day prior to the date of this Agreement be converted into (A) a number of units representing shares of Class A Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of such Company Stock Units by 3.90, and (B) a number of units representing shares of Class L Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of such Company Stock Units by 0.4875. The Company may, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company, amend the Deferred Compensation Plan to permit participants to change the date on which their Deferred Compensation Plan account is to be paid, to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code.

otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on the

 Section 7.9 _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_. (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to the exculpation of directors and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors or officers, in respect of actions, omissions or events through the Effective Time, than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company (or the relevant Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim or claims are asserted against any individual entitled to the protections of such provisions within such six year period, such provisions shall not be modified until the final disposition of any such claims. The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to each present and former director or officer, including any director or officer who serves or served as an employee benefit plan fiduciary (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in and to the extent of their capacities as such and not as stockholders and/or optionholders of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including rights relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they are serving as a director or officer of another entity at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in respect of actions, omissions or events through the Effective Time to the fullest extent provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as applicable, any indemnification agreement listed on _Item 7.9_ of the Company Letter or under applicable laws, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement;  _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the applicable law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as applicable, or any such agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel jointly selected by such Indemnified Person and the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ _,_ _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). If any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this _Section 7.9_ after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Person his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by such Indemnified Person of an undertaking (if required by applicable law) to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto. Additionally, if any Indemnified Person becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this _Section 7.9_ after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to, but shall not be obligated to, participate in the defense and settlement of such matter. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to officers and directors liability insurance at least as favorable (including in amount and scope) as the Companys existing policies for claims arising from 

    ##### 

  

    

facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
maintain the Companys existing officers and directors liability insurance
(" _D andO Insurance_") for a period of six years after the Effective Time
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not
less favorable), in each case so long as the annual premium therefor is not
in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof,
which, the Company represents, is as set forth in _Item 7.9_ of the Company
Letter (the " _Current Premium_ "); _provided_ _,_   _however_ , that if the
existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-
year period or is at an annual premium in excess of 300% of the Current
Premium, the Surviving Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such
period for a premium not in excess of 300% (on an annualized basis) of the
Current Premium. 

   

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.9_. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Persons (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the Indemnified Person (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

Without limiting the foregoing, (a) each of the Company and Newco agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on itself with respect to the Merger (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with any other Governmental Entity) and shall promptly cooperate with and furnish information to each other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon any of them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and (b) each of the Company and Newco shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its or their reasonable best efforts to obtain (and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity or other public or private third Person required to be obtained or made by Newco, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by this Agreement; _provided_ that without the prior written consent of Newco (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to any such Person whose consent or approval is being solicited any material cash or other consideration, make any material commitment or incur any material liability or other 

   ##### 

  

    

obligation to such Person. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable. 

  

 Section 7.11 _Financing_. (a) Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (provided that, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.11(c)_, Newco may replace, amend, modify, supplement or restate the Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as the terms would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of Newco to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing commitments, and (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Newco to obtaining the Debt Financing set forth therein (including by consummating the financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Funding Letters). If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters, Newco shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient (when taken together with the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters and the portion, if any, of the Debt Financing that remains available under the Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contemplated therein) on terms no less favorable (including cost of capital) than the terms described in the Commitment Letter to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the last day of the Marketing Period; _provided_ that Newco shall not be required to arrange to obtain alternative financing if such Debt Financing has become unavailable as a result of the failure of the Company or any of is Subsidiaries to comply in any material respect with _Section 7.11(b)_ which failure has not been cured within ten (10) days following written notice to the Company. Newco shall give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Newco becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letters. Newco shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and, upon the Companys request, provide copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing (other than any ancillary documents subject to confidentiality agreements) to the Company. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Newco, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its subsidiaries to, provide to Newco all cooperation reasonably requested by Newco that is necessary in connection with the Financing (including any alternative financing), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) participate on a timely basis in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) assist with the timely preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) execute and deliver any definitive financing documents or other customary certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by Newco (including consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt Financing), (iv) furnish Newco and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information 

     #####

Newco, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act in a
registered offering of securities and otherwise of type and form customarily
included in private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, to
consummate the offerings of any debt securities contemplated by the
Commitment Letters (the " _Required Financial Information_ ") and (v) obtain
accountants comfort letters and legal opinions, surveys and title insurance
as reasonably requested by Newco; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Required Financial Information be delivered later than twenty-one
(21) days prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Newco
shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. 

   

 (c) In no event shall Newco or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes of this _Section 7.11(c)_ shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect investor or potential investor in Newco, or any of the Guarantors, Newcos or any such investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other representatives) (i) award any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person other than Lehman Brothers Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Bank of America, N.A. and their Affiliates any financial advisory role on an exclusive basis (or until the No-Shop Period Start Date, any additional firm or Person on a non-exclusive basis), or (ii) engage any bank or investment bank or other provider of financing other than the active investment funds affiliated with the Guarantors on an exclusive basis (or otherwise on terms that could reasonably be expected to prevent such provider from providing or seeking to provide financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the No-Shop Period Start Date, Newco may engage one additional provider of debt financing and one additional financial advisor, in each case, on an exclusive basis. Until the No-Shop Period Start Date, neither Newco nor any of its Affiliates shall seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity financing in respect of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, or provide any information in respect thereof to any potential investor in Newco, or any of Newcos or any such investors financing sources or potential financing sources or other representatives who have not been provided any such information prior to the date hereof, other than as set forth in the Equity Funding Letters, as in effect on the date hereof, and other than limited partners in the active investment funds affiliated with the Guarantors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Newco and its Affiliates can take any of the actions otherwise prohibited by the preceding sentence with respect to up to an aggregate of $100,000,000 of equity investments or equity financing to entities or persons who (i) are not principally involved in the private equity business or (ii) are not required to file a Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act as of the date of this Agreement but without giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Newco shall cause its Affiliates to comply with the foregoing covenant. 

   

 Section 7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt written notice to Newco, and Newco shall give prompt written notice to the Company of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made at such
time or otherwise cause any condition to the obligations of any party
hereunder not to be satisfied, and (b) any failure of the Company or Newco to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery or non-delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.12_ shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice. In addition, each of the Company and Newco shall keep
the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including by promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices and other communications received by Newco or the
Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third
Person and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the response of the
recipient party or its representatives thereto, and all communication to and
from the SEC.

The Company shall prepare and deliver to Newco at or prior to the Closing (i) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Newco of the resignation of all directors of the Company and, as specified by Newco reasonably in advance of the Closing, any officers of the Company and any directors of the Significant Subsidiaries of the Company, in each case, effective at the Effective Time and (ii) all documents and filings, completed and executed by the appropriate directors, officers and representatives of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries, that are necessary to record the resignations contemplated by the preceding clause (i). 

  

 Section 7.14 _Solvency Letter_. The parties shall engage an appraisal firm of national reputation reasonably acceptable to Newco and the Company to deliver a letter in a form reasonably acceptable to the Board of Directors of the Company and addressed to Newco and the Board of Directors of the Company relating to the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately after giving effect to the Merger, the payment of the Merger Consideration, the repayment or refinancing of any Indebtedness, the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing), the equity financing pursuant to the Equity Funding Letters (the " _Solvency Letter_ ") and the other transactions contemplated hereby or related thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Newco and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) make available their respective officers, agents and other representatives as reasonably requested and upon reasonable notice and (ii) provide or make available such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Newco as may be reasonably requested by such appraisal firm in connection with delivering such Solvency Letter. 

  

 Section 7.15 _Certain Actions and Proceedings_. Until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, the Company shall consult with Newco with respect to the defense of any action, suit or proceeding instituted against the Company (or any of its directors or officers) before any court of Governmental Entity or threatened by any Governmental Entity or any third party, including a Company stockholder, to restrain, modify or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to seek damages or a discovery order in connection with such transactions.

 (g) by Newco if it fails to receive the proceeds of one or more debt financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(g)_ shall not be available to Newco if its failure to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, including _Section 7.11_, has been the cause or resulted in the failure to receive such proceeds.

Dear Gary and Mary:  

 

This letter memorializes our recent discussions and mutual understanding
regarding equity terms and your continuing ownership interest in West
Corporation (the "Company"). 

  

We are negotiating a Merger Agreement that requires a portion of the shares
that you own to be rolled over as a continuing ownership interest. This
"rollover equity" will be in the form of "strips" of securities of the same
classes that the THL and Quadrangle investors will receive at closing as a
result of their cash investments and the merger transactions. Your
continuing ownership interest will be in the amount of $250 million
(structured to be of the same classes as in the same amounts as would apply
to new cash investors in this transaction). Attached to this letter is a more
detailed description of the proposed capital structure for the
recapitalized Company. 

  

 _Exhibit A_ describes the economic terms of these Class L and Class A
securities.  _Exhibit B_ describes the management equity incentive programs
(purchased stock, restricted stock and stock options) that we intend to adopt
for Tom Barker and his team. _Exhibit C_ is a projected opening
capitalization table, as an example of what securities are likely to be
issued at closing and our anticipated relative ownership interests. We are
also attaching to this letter (as _Exhibit D_) a summary term sheet
regarding the stockholders agreement that you, the new sponsor group
investors from THL and Quadrangle and the Company will sign at closing to
supersede prior arrangements and provide for coordination in the future. 

  

Finally, you agree that you will enter into a confidentiality, non-competition
and non-solicitation agreement as described in _Exhibit D_.

 _Letter from Omaha 
 Acq. Corp to West_

      ##### 

 

     

 _May 31, 2006_ 

   

 _ _Exhibit A__ 

   

 _Summary of A/L Structure (Omaha Transaction)_  

  

To effect the recapitalization contemplated by the May 31, 2006 Merger
Agreement, the Sponsors ( _i.e.,_ THL / Quadrangle) will establish a
transitory merger subsidiary. At closing, the Sponsors will invest up to
$762.4 million1 into the transitory merger subsidiary before it is merged
with and into Omaha. Omaha will survive the merger and continue as a Delaware
corporation. Pursuant to the merger, Omahas certificate of incorporation
will be amended to provide for two classes of common stock. In general, cash
investors (i.e., the Sponsors and, to the extent they invest cash,
management) and Founders will acquire a combination of Class L and Class A
shares (in strips of eight A Shares and one L share) in exchange for cash or
in respect of rollover shares. Supplemental management equity (restricted
stock and option programs) is implemented with Class A shares/options only.
Attached hereto as Exhibit C is an estimated capitalization table as
of closing (after giving effect to the merger, Founder rollover, and senior
executive stock purchases). General terms of these securities will be: 

   

 _Class L Shares_: 

  

       | o  |   | Each L Share is entitled to priority return
preference amount equal to the sum of (x) $90 per share base amount _plus_
(y) an amount sufficient to generate 12% IRR on that base amount from date of
initial closing until the liquidation preference is paid in full. It is
contemplated that at closing the Company will issue 10.1 mm Class
L Shares.2  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | o  |   | Each L Share also participates in upside on a per share
basis. Because Omaha will issue or reserve approximately 10.1 mm Class L
Shares and approximately 91.1 mm Class A Shares3 this translates to the Class
L Shares, as a class, participating in approx. 10% of upside. But that
percentage would change over time as a result of future issuances,
forfeitures of restricted stock or options that dont vest, redemptions,
etc. See description of distribution rights below.  
   

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    _1_   |   | _This amount includes cash subscription amounts from
THL and Quadrangle, and any co-investors. A portion of this amount will
be subscribed for by T. Barker ($15mm), N. Berger and other senior
executive officers at closing._   
   
    _2_   |   | _These 10.1 mm Class L Shares include: (i)
approx. 7,624,000 L Shares issued as part of "purchased equity" for cash
investments (in the case of sponsors, through cash capitalization of
transitory merger co and then merger into Omaha; in the case of senior
management in the form of cash reinvestment at closing), and (ii) approx.
2,500,000 L Shares to be issued to Founders as part of their rollover
consideration and continuing equity interest in Omaha._  
   
    _3_   |   | _This 91.1 mm figure includes: (i) approx. 60,991,000
A Shares issued as part of "purchased equity" for cash investments (in the
case of sponsors, through cash capitalization of merger co and in the case of
senior management in the form of cash reinvestment at closing), (ii)
20,000,000 rollover equity shares to Founders, (iii) approximately 8,099,100
restricted A Shares to be issued to management under a restricted stock
program and (iii) approximately 2,024,800 A Shares reserved for option
plan._  
      ##### 

  

       

 _Class A Shares_: 

  

       | o  |   | Class A Shares behave like standard common stock.
Class A Shares participate in upside after all debt and Class L preference
amount and priority return is satisfied. Based on initial numbers, Class A
Shares (including purchased A Shares, restricted A Shares issued under a new
restricted stock program and A Shares issuable upon exercise of options under
a new stock option program, looked at as a class) get approximately 90%
of that incremental upside if all restricted shares vest and all options vest
and are exercised. Again, percentages are _not_ locked in.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | o  |   | Note that restricted stock program (representing
approximately 8% of upside) and stock option program (representing
approximately 2% of upside) are both for Class A Shares.  
   

 

Voting: Each Share (whether Class A or Class L) is entitled to one vote per
share on all matters on which stockholders vote, subject to Delaware law
regarding class voting rights where charter amendments would affect the
relative rights of different classes, etc. Also, a stockholder agreement will
include various voting agreements (e.g., board representation and other
governance rights to implement exit decisions approved by lead sponsor,
etc.). 

  

Distributions. Dividends and other distributions to stockholders in respect of
Shares, whether as part of any ordinary distribution of earnings or as a
leveraged recap or in the event of an ultimate liquidation and distribution
of available corporate assets, are to be paid as follows.  _First_ , holders
of Class L Shares are entitled to receive an amount equal to the Class L base
amount of $90 per share _plus_ an amount sufficient to generate a 12% IRR on
that base amount, compounded quarterly from [ _closing date of merger_ ],
2006 to the date of payment. (Because there will be approximately 10,123,900
Class L Shares issued at or about the time of closing, the aggregate
liquidation preference of those shares starts at about $911 million.) _Second_
, after payment of this preference amount and priority return to Class L
holders, the holders of Class A Shares and Class L Shares participate
together, as a single class, in any and all distributions by the Company. 

  

Conversion of L Shares. Class L Shares automatically convert into Class A
Shares immediately prior to an IPO. Also, the Board of Directors may elect to
cause all Class L Shares to be converted into Class A Shares in connection
with a transfer (by stock sale, merger or otherwise) of a majority of all
Common Stock to a 3rd party (other than to THL and affiliates). In the case of
any such conversion (whether on IPO or sale), if any unpaid Class L priority
amounts (base $90/share plus accrued 12% IRR) remains unpaid at the time of
conversion it will be "paid" in additional Class A Shares valued at the deal
price (in case of IPO, at the IPO price net of underwriters discount); that
is each Class L Share converts into a number of Class A Shares equal to (i)
one  _plus_ (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the unpaid priority
amount on such Class L Share and the denominator of which is the value of a
Class A Share at the time of conversion. 

    ##### 

  

     

 _May 31, 2006 _ 
__Exhibit B__ 

   

 _Summary of Management Equity Programs_  

  

Purchased Strips. As reflected on Exhibit C (sample capitalization table) and
described in Exhibit A (description of A/L structure), Omaha will offer
senior executive officers an opportunity to buy strips of Class A and Class L
shares at closing. Parties anticipate that Tom Barker will subscribe for $15
mm. 

  

Restricted Shares. Omaha will also adopt a new restricted stock program
(representing approximately eight percent (8%)4 of "upside" after all debt
and Class L preference amount and priority return is satisfied), pursuant to
which it will be authorized to issue restricted stock (Class A shares)
subject to vesting, as follows: 

   

     o  |   | _5-Year Time Vested Restricted Stock_. Approximately one-
third (33.33%) of all restricted stock grants will be subject to time
vesting. These shares will vest at a rate of 20% per year over a period of 5
years from date of grant, subject to continuation of employment. These
options will accelerate on Change of Control (as defined in
Stockholders Agreement).  
---|---|--- 
      
  o  |   | _Performance-Based Restricted Stock_. Remaining two-thirds
(66.67%) of restricted stock awards will be subject to performance-based
vesting calculated by reference to the Sponsors return on investment as of
Exit Event (that is, Sponsors sale of at least 90% of Omaha Stock for cash
or marketable securities5), and also subject to continuation of employment
through Exit Event or for specified period thereafter, as follows:  
   

   

 (x) one-third of the performance-based restricted stock (i.e., about 22.22% of all awards) become eligible to vest if total return on Sponsors investment is greater than 2x and the IRR to Sponsors exceeds 15% (in each case, calculated after giving effect to restricted stock vesting arising as a result of such Exit Event); and 

   

 (y) a ratable portion of the remaining two-thirds of the performance-based restricted stock (i.e., about 44.45% of all awards) become eligible to vest if total return on Sponsors investment is more than 2x and IRR to Sponsors exceeds 15%, such ratable portion to be calculated on a straight-line method from (A) nothing for 2x return to (B) all for 3x return (all calculated after giving effect to restricted stock vesting arising as a result of such Exit Event); 

   

 _provided,_ that (i) upon an Exit Event any unvested portion of performance-
based awards will terminate, and (ii) in the event of an Exit Event prior to
the 3rd year of grant ( _i.e._ , 3rd anniversary of closing under merger
agreement), any performance-based awards that become eligible to vest under
the foregoing formulae will be subject to a time-vesting requirement that the
holder continue employment with Omaha through 3rd anniversary of

grant (subject however to partial immediate vesting of those performance-
earned portions tied to Sponsor liquidity, to be discussed and set forth in
definitive docs.). 

 

It is contemplated that the restricted A Shares issuable under this restricted
stock plan will either be purchased by management (at the same FMV-based per
share price paid by others at closing in connection with opening
capitalization) or granted outright; and that the Company will provide
a bonus to cover up-front 83(b) election-triggered tax on restricted stock
grants. [ _To be discussed._ ] 

  

Stock Option Program. Omaha will also adopt a new stock option program
(representing approximately two percent (2%)6 of "upside" after all debt and
Class L preference amount and priority return is satisfied), terms of which
will be determined by its board of directors. It is currently contemplated
that all options will be "non-qualified" stock options subject to time vesting
over five years (although the board may, with CEO approval) elect to include
performance vesting terms in connection with particular grants), that
unexercised options will expire upon the earlier of a limited period (equal
to period allowed under Companys current stock option program)
following termination of employment or 10th anniversary of grant, and that
exercise/strike price of options will be equal to the fair market value of
underlying shares on date of grant. 

  

Put Rights. In the event a Management Holder dies, heirs / estate will have a
right to put purchased (and, if applicable, rollover) Shares to the Company
at FMV, subject to room / no default under credit agreement. Also, in the
event a Management Holder has to leave employment under "hardship" situation
(as determined by Board upon recommendation of CEO) the Board will cause
the Company to use reasonable efforts to exercise its Call rights under the
Stockholders Agreement to purchase at FMV all purchased (and, if applicable)
rollover Shares held by such Management Holder, subject to room / no default
under credit agreement. 

  

Expenses. Company will pay reasonable fees / expense of Winston and Strawn,
counsel to management, incurred in connection with implementation of
foregoing management equity programs.

 _Exhibit D_ 

   

 _Omaha: Summary of Stockholder Agreements_  

   

 This term sheet describes proposed terms of agreements to be entered into among West Corporation (" _Omaha_ ") and its stockholders at closing of the recapitalization transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated on or about the date hereof, between Omaha and Omaha Acquisition Corp (the " _Recapitalization Transactions_ "). At that time, Omaha would be the parent of [Omaha Intermediate Holdings, Inc.1 (" _Midco_ "), which, in turn, would be the parent of] the various principal operating subsidiaries (the " _Principal Operating Subsidiaries_ "). This proposal presumes that post-recapitalization equity will be approximately as follows at closing (before management incentive program(s)): 

   

       | o  |   | THL funds and related entities (collectively, "
_THL_ ") and Quadrangle funds and related entities (" _Quadrangle_ " and,
together with THL, the " _Investors_ ") will acquire shares representing
approximately [___]%2 of post-recapitalization equity;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | o  |   | Gary and Mary West (together with any family members,
related trusts, etc., the " _Founders_ ") will retain shares representing
approximately [22]%3 of post-recapitalization equity; and  
      
    | o  |   | Tom Barker and other Senior Executives will purchase at
closing shares representing approximately [___]%4 of post-recapitalization
equity.  
   

  

 These terms will be embodied in one or more stockholder, registrations rights or other agreements among Omaha, and its stockholders, including the Investors, the Founders and any employees who own equity in Omaha (the " _Management Holders_ " and, together with the Investors and the Founders, the " _Stockholders_ "). 

  

 __Governance__  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

Board of 

  |   | The board of directors of Omaha will initially have six (6) members
consisting of:  
  

Directors:

  |   |   
   

   

       | o  |   | four (4) directors designated by THL Investors;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | o  |   | one (1) director designated by Quadrangle Investors;  
      
    | o  |   | CEO to serve as director (ex officio)  
   

 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | The Stockholders Agreement or the certificate of incorporation will
provide for rights to designate directors, and for the required resignation
of directors designated by the Investors in the event of a transfer of shares
in accordance with the following.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | So long as Quadrangle Investors own at least 25% of the shares
initially purchased by them, the Quadrangle Investors will be entitled to
designate one (1) director and one (1) non-director observer (pursuant to
standard observer rights agreement).

cash equity provided by new investors (including Investors, Tom Barker and
other management investors, etc.) falls below $700mm_.  
   
    _4_   |   | _Tom Barker to invest $15 million; other senior
executives under discussion._  
      ##### 

  

      

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | So long as THL Investors own at least 5% of the shares initially
purchased by them, the THL Investors right to designate directors will be
determined as follows:  
   

  

       |   |   |   |   |   
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
   Ownership (remaining percentage of THL Groups  |   |   
   Initial Investor Shares)  |   | No. of Directors  
     

Greater than 50%

  |   |   |   | 4  |   
   

Between 30%  50%

  |   |   |   | 3  |   
   

Between 15%  30%

  |   |   |   | 2  |   
   

Between 5%  15%

  |   |   |   | 1  |   
  

Less than 5%

  |   |   |   | 0  |   
   

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | The thresholds contained above will automatically be adjusted
downward proportionately in the event of any transaction that causes a
substantially proportionate reduction in holdings of all of the Investors
(e.g., a pro-rata redemption, reverse stock split or recapitalization),
_provided that_ no such adjustment will restore or increase the number of
director designees to which an Investor is entitled. As the result of
resignation of a director due to these sell-down provisions, the size of the
board will be reduced or the resigning director will be replaced by an
independent director.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | For these purposes, an Investors holdings will be aggregated with
those of its (i) related investment entities (as specified at closing), (ii)
affiliated investment funds (including entities investing solely on behalf of
the Investor or such funds and entities with common GP or advisor) or (iii)
any entity that is directly or indirectly wholly-owned by such Investor or one
or more of such funds (each, an " _Affiliated Fund_ ").  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Rights to the Investors board seats will be transferable by an
Investor to any Affiliated Fund that holds shares, but otherwise will be
transferable only with the consent of the other Investors.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | The Investors will have the right to remove and replace their
respective director-designees at any time and for any reason, and to fill any
vacancies otherwise resulting in the director positions held by their
respective designees; _provided_ that if a Quadrangle designated director is a
person other than a principal or employee of Quadrangle, then the election or
appointment of such other person as a director will be subject to the
approval of THL, which consent will not unreasonably be withheld.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | For such time as the Investors own 50% or more of the voting shares
of Omaha, all Stockholders will vote as a group to elect the board in
accordance with the foregoing.  
  



  |   |   
  

Information 
 Rights 

  |   | For so long as the Founders own more than 20% of the Shares
retained by them after giving effect to the Recapitalization Transactions,
the Founders will, subject to entering into customary and reasonably
satisfactory confidentiality agreement including covenant not to use or
disclose confidential information of the Company, have customary information
rights including rights to receive quarterly financial statements, annual
business plan and budget and annual audited financial statements when
available.  
  



  |   |   
  

Certain 
 Actions: 

  |   | Prior to an IPO, all Stockholders (other than the Founders) will
agree to vote as determined by the Investor Majority for so long as the
Investors own Shares in an amount equal to at least 25% of the shares
initially issued to them as part of the  
   

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | Recapitalization Transactions (the " _Initial Investor Shares_ ")
on the following actions to the extent that they require a vote of Omaha
stockholders: (a) any Change of Control transaction; and (b) any amendment of
the certificate of incorporation to the extent required to accommodate any of
the foregoing transactions or any increase in authorized capital required in
connection with conversion or proposed conversion of Class L Shares into Class
A Shares. Subject to compliance with drag-along obligations (described
below), the Founders would be free to vote shares on all matters in any
manner they wish. As used herein, the term " _Investor Majority_ " means the
holders of a majority of all voting shares held by the Investors at any
relevant time.  
  



  |   |   
  

Change of Control: 

  |   | A " _Change of Control_ " will mean (i) any consolidation or merger
of Omaha with or into any other entity, or any other corporate reorganization
or transaction (including the acquisition of capital stock of Omaha), whether
or not Omaha is a party thereto, in which the stockholders of
Omaha immediately prior to such consolidation, merger or reorganization and
their Affiliated Funds, own capital stock either (x) representing less than
50% of the economic interests in or voting power of Omaha or other surviving
entity immediately after such consolidation, merger or reorganization or
(y) that does not have the power to elect a majority of the entire board of
directors of Omaha or other surviving entity immediately after such
consolidation, merger or reorganization, (ii) any transaction or series of
related transactions, whether or not Omaha is a party thereto, after giving
effect to which in excess of 50% of Omaha voting power is owned by any
person or group of persons and their respective affiliates, other than the
Investors, excluding, in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) any IPO
or bona fide primary or secondary public offering following the occurrence of
an IPO; or (iii) a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of Omaha and its Principal Subsidiaries (taken as a
whole).  
  



  |   |   
  

Pari Passu: 

  |   | The Founder Shares and Investor Shares will be of the same
Class(es) and, for each class without regard to whether owned by Founders or
Investors, will be entitled to equal treatment in respect of Change of
Control Transactions, dividends, distributions (whether by merger or
otherwise), issuer repurchases of Shares or similar recapitalization
transactions. In addition, Stockholders (including the Founders) will be
entitled to the preemptive right, tag-along, drag-along, piggy-back and
other registration rights and 144 sale coordination and notice rights
described herein.  
   

   

 __Limitations on Transfer__  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

Transfer 
 Restrictions: 

  |   | Prior to the earlier of an IPO or Change of Control, no
Stockholder may transfer shares to an entity that competes with Omaha or
the Principal Operating Subsidiaries in any material respect without the
consent of either (x) at such times as the Investors own shares in an amount
equal to at least 25% of the Initial Investor Shares, the Investor Majority,
and (y) at such times as the Investors own shares in an amount less than 25%
of the Initial Investor Shares, the Board of Directors.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Prior to the earlier of an IPO or a Change of Control,
no Stockholder may transfer shares without the consent of either (x) at such
times as the Investors own shares in an amount equal to at least 25% of the
Initial Investor Shares, the Investor Majority, and (y) at such times as the
Investors own shares in an amount less than 25% of the Initial Investor
Shares, the Board of Directors, in either case other than (i) transfers to
Permitted Transferees (which may include Omaha), and (ii) transfers approved
by the Investor Majority (or, if after the Investors own shares in an amount
less than 25% of the Initial Investor Shares,

  |   | the Board of Directors) and to which tag-along or drag-along
provisions (described below) apply.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | " _Permitted Transferee_ " means, (i) with respect to an Investor,
such Investors Affiliated Funds, (ii) with respect to any natural person,
members of the immediate family of such person and (upon death) such persons
heirs / estate, (iii) a trust or other entity formed for estate planning
purposes or (iv) Omaha.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Permitted Transferees will be required to become party to
the Stockholders Agreement with respect to those shares transferred. Shares
that are transferred by an Investor to one of its Affiliated Funds will
retain their character as Investor Shares under the Stockholders Agreement;
Shares that are transferred by a Founder to his or her estate, immediate
family member, or trust for estate planning purposes will retain their
character as Founder Shares under the Stockholders Agreement; and Shares that
are transferred by any Management Holder to his or her estate, immediate
family member, or trust for estate planning purposes will retain
their character as Management Shares under the Stockholders Agreement.  
  



  |   |   
  

Rights of First Offer: 

  |   | After an IPO and until such time as the Investors hold less
than 20% of all outstanding shares, no Stockholder party to the Stockholder
Agreement (other than THL Investors in a transfer to which Tag-Along Rights
apply) may transfer shares (other than transfers to Permitted Transferees)
without first offering to transfer the shares to the Investors on a pro rata
basis (based on ownership at the time of the transfer). Customary ROFO
mechanics of notice, offer, and term restrictions.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | ROFO will not apply to Shares sold (i) in registered
public offerings, which are covered in Registration Rights below or
(ii) pursuant to Rule 144.  
  



  |   |   
  

Tag-Along 
 Rights: 

  |   | Prior to an IPO, Stockholders will have the right to participate
on a pro rata basis, on equivalent terms and conditions, in any transfer or
series of related transfers by an Investor to a person who is not a Permitted
Transferee.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Following an IPO, Investors and Founders will have the right
to participate on a pro rata basis, on equivalent terms and conditions, in
any block sale or other private transfer or series of related private
transfers by an Investor or Founder to any person(s) who are not Permitted
Transferees of the transferor, but not in any sales effected in broker
transactions or directly with a market maker (as to which the 144 Sales
Coordination and Notice provisions described below will apply) or any
registered offering (as to which the Registration Rights provisions described
below will apply).  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | All tag-along provisions will expire upon a Change of Control.  
  



  |   |   
  

Drag-Along 
 Rights: 

  |   | If the Investor Majority proposes to transfer shares in a
single transfer or series of related transfers that would (together with all
shares being dragged along) result in a Change of Control at a time when the
Investors own shares in an amount equal to at least 25% of the Initial
Investor Shares, then the Investor Majority may cause all other Stockholders
to transfer shares on the same terms and conditions as those received by the
Investor Majority, _provided that_ in the case of a sale to an Affiliate of
any Investor the exercise of such Drag-Along rights will be subject to
approval of the transaction by holders of a majority of shares held
by unaffiliated Investors. Drag-Along rights will expire upon an IPO.  
   

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

Tag and Drag Mechanics: 

  |   | If at the time of a sale subject to tag-along or drag-along
rights and obligations the Company has issued and outstanding shares of more
than one class, then tag-along or drag-along percentages (as applicable) will
be class-based (e.g., common shares on common shares, preferred shares on
preferred shares, etc.) and will include any convertible securities on all
relevant classes.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Each participating seller in a tag- or drag-along sale will
(a) enter into such agreements as reasonably requested by the initiating
seller to which the initiating seller is also party, including agreements to
(i) make individual representations, warranties and covenants as to
unencumbered title to the shares and the power to transfer such shares, (ii)
be liable as to such representations, warranties and covenants, in each case
to the same extent, but with respect to its own shares, as the
initiating seller and (iii) vote in favor of or take other actions
appropriate to approve the transaction; and (b) be liable to the same
extent (on a pro rata basis) as the initiating seller in respect of
other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in respect
of Omaha and its subsidiaries, _provided that_ the aggregate amount
of liability described in this clause (b) will not exceed the lesser of (x)
such sellers pro rata portion of any such liability or (y) the proceeds to
such seller in connection with the sale. In addition, in the case of a drag-
along sale in which any Founder is required to sell by the Drag-Along rights
described in the preceding section, Founders liability described in clause
(b) (i.e., in respect of such other representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in respect of Omaha and its subsidiaries) will not exceed the
lesser of (x) such Founders pro rata portion of any such liability or (y)
one-third (33-1/3%) of the proceeds to such Founder in connection with the
sale.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | The Stockholders Agreement will contain other customary
mechanics (e.g., exception from tag in stock-for-stock deal if inclusion
of any unaccredited investor would violate law, require delivery
of additional information, etc.).  
  



  |   |   
  

144 Sales (Coordination and Notice): 

  |   | Following an IPO, the Investors, the senior Management Holders
and the Founders will use reasonable efforts to coordinate efforts
to transfer shares pursuant to Rule 144 in a fashion that permits each to
sell its pro rata share of any group volume limitation.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | These coordination provisions may be suspended from time to time
or terminated at the election of either (x) at any time when the Investors
own shares in an amount not less than 25% of the Initial Investor Shares, at
the election of the Investor Majority or (y) at any time after the Investors
own less than 25% of the Initial Investor Shares, at the election of the
holders of a majority of the Shares then subject to these coordination and
notice provisions. During any suspension period, the Investor Majority (or,
if applicable holders of a majority of the Shares then subject to these
coordination and notice provisions) may elect to require the Investors, the
senior Management Holders and the Founders to provide one another with
advance notice of proposed transfers of shares pursuant to Rule 144, but no
coordination of sales would be required.  
  



  |   |   
  

Distributions to LPs: 

  |   | Until the earlier of three years after an IPO and the time at
which an Investor owns less than 5% of the outstanding shares, such Investor
must provide at least 10 days prior notice to each other stockholders that
then owns (individually or together with its Affiliated Funds or other
affiliates) more than 5% of outstanding shares of any plans to distribute
unregistered shares and use reasonable efforts to coordinate the timing of
any such distribution with other Investors choosing to
distribute unregistered shares at such time.  
   

    ##### 

  

   

 _ _Miscellaneous__  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

Participation 
 Rights: 

  |   | Prior to an IPO or a Change of Control, each Investor, Founder and
(subject to customary exceptions for unaccredited investors, etc) Management
Holder will be entitled to participate pro rata (based on shares owned) in
primary offerings of equity or convertible debt of Omaha or any of its
subsidiaries to any Investor or Founder, or any of their respective
affiliates (it being agreed that Founders will be able to participate in such
offerings on the same basis as Investors whether or not the offering is not
primarily directed toward Investors).  
  



  |   |   
  

Call Rights: 

  |   | Prior to an IPO, the Company will have the right to purchase vested
Shares held by Management Holders following termination of employment as
follows: (x) In the event of a termination for cause, the Company will have a
call right at the lower of cost or FMV with respect to incentive equity but
not rolled over or purchased equity (for which only call right in (y) will
apply); and (y) In the event of a termination of employment for any other
reason (e.g., death, disability, voluntary resignation, involuntary
termination without cause), the Company will have a call right all equity
(including purchased, rollover equity, if any, or vested restricted stock or
other incentive equity) at FMV.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | All stock options or restricted securities that have not vested at
the time of termination shall be forfeited to the Company.  
  



  |   |   
  

Amendment 
 and Waiver: 

  |   | Amendments or waivers require the approval of holders of a majority
of all shares held by parties to the stockholder agreements, with customary
provisions for special approval requirements for amendments and waivers that
discriminate by share designation or against particular Stockholders. The
following shall require the approval of any Investor or Founder who would be

 _ _Registration Rights__  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

Registration 
 Rights: 

  |   | The Investor Majority may exercise demand rights to cause an IPO.
If there is a secondary offering of Shares in the IPO, the Founders will be
able to also sell Shares in the IPO, in an amount equal to the greater of (x)
the Founders pro rata share based on relative ownership and (y) $75 million
of Shares (at IPO price). After the IPO, the Investor Majority will have
(subject to piggyback registration rights described below) the first 3 demand
registration rights post-IPO, and thereafter unlimited S-3 demand rights.
Following the first 3 post-IPO registrations, any Investor or Founder may
exercise demand registration rights, subject to the following: (i) not more
than one demand in any 180 day period without consent of the Investor
Majority; and (ii) each demand must  
   

    ##### 

  

  

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    

  

  |   | be for at least $75 million unless otherwise consented to by
Investor Majority. In addition, if within the first four years after an IPO
the Investor Majority has not initiated 3 post-IPO demands, as described
above, then notwithstanding the foregoing limitations any Investor and/or the
Founders will have a right to exercise demand registrations, subject to the
following: (i) not more than one demand in any 180 day period without consent
of the Investor Majority; and (ii) each demand must be for at least $75
million unless otherwise consented to by Investor Majority. In addition, at
such time after the IPO as the Investors no longer hold more than 25% of the
Initial Investor Shares and have recouped in cash (from sale proceeds,
dividends or other distributions paid in respect of Shares) 100% of their
cost basis for all Shares (whether or not 3 post-IPO demands by the
Investors have been made and whether or not any particular period of time has
expired after the IPO), then any Investor or Founder may exercise demand
registration rights, subject to the following: (i) not more than one demand
in any 180 day period; and (ii) each demand must be for at least $75 million.
All Stockholders (Investors, Founders and Management Holders) will be
entitled to customary pro rata piggyback registration rights on public
offerings of Omaha stock. All underwriters cutbacks will be on a pro rata
basis for all selling Stockholders (based on relative ownership
percentages), subject to underwriter determinations regarding marketability /
pricing. In addition, after the fourth anniversary of the IPO, the Investors
and Founders (or any subset or group thereof) may cause the Company to use
reasonable efforts to file and cause to become effective a shelf
registration statement on Form S-3 in respect of shares pursuant to which
they may sell Shares in an underwritten shelf takedown or by other means,
subject to standard blackout provisions (but in no event will the number of
un-blacked-out days per year be less than 240 days), and only if and for so
long as such shelf registration covers not less than $75 million worth of
Shares  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Omaha will pay reasonable expenses of Investors and Founders in
connection with registrations and sale (other than underwriters discount and
commissions).  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Definitive agreement will include customary provision regarding
cooperation in connection with public offerings, including agreements
regarding entering into customary underwriting agreements, and providing
reasonable assistance with respect to due diligence and road show
presentations.  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | The foregoing terms, which will be embodied in a new registration
rights agreement, will replace any pre-existing registration rights
agreements (and prior registration rights agreements with Founders will be
terminated).  
  



  |   |   
  

  

  |   | Each Stockholder owning more than three percent (3%) of outstanding
Shares will be bound by any lock-up agreement in connection with a public
offering in the form and for the period entered into:  
  

Market 
 Standoff: 

  |   | (i) in the case of an IPO, by the Investor Majority, and (ii)
otherwise, by the holders of a majority of the shares participating in the
offering. The lock-up agreement will cover a period of no more than 90 days
(180 days in the case of an IPO) plus such additional time (not to exceed 20
days) as may be required to permit the managing underwriters analyst to
publish research updates; _provided, that_ no holder will be obligated to be
bound by a lock-up agreement unless the Investors that hold a majority of
shares held by all Investors approve such lock-up agreement.  
  



  |   |   
  

Termination of Rights: 

  |   | Registration rights expire as to any share: (i) when the share
ceases to be subject to the Stockholders Agreement, (ii) when the share is
sold under an effective registration statement, (iii) when the share is sold
under Rule 144 or 145, (iv) when disposition of such share is permitted
under Rule 144 or 145 and the holder, together with its affiliates, holds no
more than 1% of the applicable class or (v) when the share has been otherwise
transferred, an unlegended certificate for the share has been issued and the
share can thereafter be sold without registration.
