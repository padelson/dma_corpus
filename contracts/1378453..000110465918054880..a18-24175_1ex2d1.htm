or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, subject to the terms and

and limitations on Sellers liability as set forth elsewhere in this

the provisions of Sections 2.5 and 2.6 shall survive the Closing or any

withdrawal and refiling.

 



 

3.5 _Title and Survey_. Buyer acknowledges that it has received from Seller
for each of the Properties (i) a commitment for title insurance (each, a "
_Commitment_ ," and together, the " _Commitments_ ") to be issued by the New

_Title Company_ ") as lead insurer, provided First American Title, Atlanta NCS
shall also provide title services for Buyer in connection with the transaction

3.6 _Cross-Division Contracts_. Pursuant to the terms of the Contracts set
forth on _Schedule 3.6_ (the " _Cross-Division Contracts_ "), Seller has
certain rights and/or obligations that affect both the Business and a separate
business owned and operated by Seller and/or its Affiliates which is not
included in the Assets. At Closing, (x) Seller shall sever or terminate each
Cross-Division Contract in a manner and form reasonably agreed to by the Buyer
with respect to the Business and (y) Buyer shall, at its option, either (i)
enter into substitute Contracts for the Business with each counterparty to the
Cross-Division Contracts for the Business (either pursuant to a novation or
assignment of the applicable rights and obligations thereunder) (each, a "
_New Contract_ "), or (ii) obtain (A) a release of Seller of its liability
under the applicable Cross-Division Contract from the applicable counterparty
thereto, which release shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller, and (B) provide an indemnity from Buyer Parent, in form and substance

incur under the applicable Cross-Division Contract for which a New Contract
was not entered into; _provided_ , that if a counterparty to a Cross-Division
Contract refuses to permit the assignment of such Cross-Division Contract to
Buyer or enter into a New Contract with Buyer, then Buyer shall have no
obligation to enter into a New Contract, obtain a release, or provide any

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification with respect to such Cross-Division Contract. Upon execution
and delivery thereof by Seller, each New Contract shall thereafter be deemed
to be an Assumed Contract for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **4.** **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

4.1 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Responsibility for Payment of Taxes_. Unless otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all Taxes payable
with respect to the Assets and the Business for the period up to the Closing
Date and Buyer shall be responsible for such Taxes for the period including
the Closing Date and thereafter. Seller shall be responsible for the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to
the Assets and the Business for all Tax periods ending prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Regardless of which Party is liable for such Taxes under
applicable Law, sales Tax, use Tax, real property transfer Tax, grantor or
grantee Tax, documentary stamp Tax, transfer Tax, motor vehicle Tax,
registration Tax or similar Tax or recording expense or notarial fee
attributable to, imposed upon or arising from the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be split equally between Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall file all
Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes and, upon receipt by Seller of written
request from Buyer, Seller shall provide reasonable assistance in connection
with such filings. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith to reach a mutual agreement on the allocation of the Purchase
Price among the Assets for purposes of the transfer Taxes subject to this
_Section 4.1(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Proration of Certain Taxes_. Annual personal property Taxes, real
property Taxes, and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the
Assets and the Business (the " _Property Taxes_ "), shall be pro-rated as of
the Closing Date, with Seller liable to the extent such items relate to any
time period (or portion thereof) prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing
Charges_ ") and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to periods (or
any portion thereof) on and after the Closing Date. To the extent Property
Taxes are assessed with respect to a period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date, the Pre-Closing Charges shall be calculated by multiplying
the amount of such Taxes and other charges for the entire period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the period from the
first day of the period through and including the day prior to the Closing
Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period.
Seller shall furnish Buyer with such documents and other records as Buyer
reasonably requests to confirm such proration calculations. At the Closing,
the net amount of all Pre-Closing Charges shall be paid in addition to, or
netted against, the Base Purchase Price, as applicable. If the amount of any
Property Taxes is not fixed and determined as of the Closing, then the
foregoing Closing adjustment shall be based on the amount thereof as
reasonably estimated by Seller at the Closing based on the most recently
available information. If following the Closing either Seller or Buyer
receives (i) any assessment of any Property Taxes that are in whole or in part
the responsibility of the other pursuant to this _Section 4.1(c)_, Buyer
shall pay the same to the appropriate Taxing

 



      
 

 



 

Authority and Seller will remit prior to the due date of assessment to Buyer
the amount of the Pre-Closing Charge with respect thereto except to the extent
reflected as a debit to Seller on the Settlement Statement, or (ii) any refund
or credit of any Property Taxes that are in whole or in part the
responsibility of the other pursuant to this _Section 4.1(c)_, such party
shall promptly remit to the other the portion of such amount for which the
other is responsible except to the extent the other has received a credit for
the same on the Settlement Statement.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.1_ shall survive the Closing.

 



 

4.2 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Employees_. No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to,
and effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon, the Closing
Date, Buyer shall offer to each Employee who is then employed by Seller
employment commencing as of the Closing Date as an "at will" employee
similarly situated with compensation and benefits comparable to those provided
to such Employee by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing
and on terms and conditions consistent with this _Section 4.2(a_), provided,
however, that any such offers of employment to any Employees shall be made
contingent on the Employees ability to pass the standard background check,
drug screening, verification of eligibility to work in the United States, and
any other reasonable pre-employment screening that the Buyer or designated
third-party operations generally conduct for newly hired employees. With
respect to any Employee on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or
long term disability leave or layoff with recall rights as of the Closing Date
(each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "), Buyers offer of employment shall also be
contingent on such Inactive Employees return to active employment immediately
following such absence and within six (6) months of the Closing Date, or such
later date as required under applicable Laws. At least five (5) days prior to
the date on which Buyer provides each Employee with such offer of employment,
Buyer shall provide to Seller, for Sellers review and comment (which comments
Buyer shall consider in good faith) each template offer of employment to be
used by Buyer in making such offers. Each Employee who accepts Buyers offer
of employment pursuant to this _Section 4.2(a)_, and each Employee who
accepts an offer of employment from Buyer in accordance with _Section
4.2(e)_, shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee._ " Seller
agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Buyer to effectuate Buyers offers of
employment to the Employees, including with regards to any transfer of any
visa or other documentation. With respect to each Transferred Employee, Buyer
shall maintain, for a period of at least twelve (12) months immediately
following the Closing Date, (i) a wage rate or cash salary level that is no
lower than that in effect for such employee immediately prior to the Closing
and (ii) cash incentive compensation and employee benefits that are, in each
case, no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided by Buyer and
its Affiliates to its similarly situated employees. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Buyer shall not be prohibited by this _Section 4.2(a)_ from
terminating the employment of any Transferred Employee following the Closing
Date, subject, however, to Buyers obligations under this _Section 4.2_. As
of and after the Closing, Buyer shall provide to each Transferred Employee
full credit for all purposes under any employee benefit plan offered by Buyer
and each other employee benefit plan, policy or

 



      
 

 



 

arrangement (excluding any stock option plans), in each case maintained for
the benefit of Transferred Employees as of and after the Closing by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, for such Transferred Employees service prior to the
Closing with Seller or any of its Affiliates, to the same extent such service
is recognized by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be required to
recognize such service (x) for purposes of benefit accrual under defined
benefit pension plans, (y) for purposes of plans that are frozen to new
participants, or (z) to the extent that such credit would result in
duplication of benefits. Buyer and Seller agree to utilize, or cause their
respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard procedure set forth in Revenue
Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, for wage reporting with respect to any
Transferred Employees.

 



 

(b) _Health Coverages_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive any limitation on health insurance coverage of Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions under all applicable
medical plans of Buyer or its Affiliates to the extent that such condition did
not apply, was satisfied or waived under the comparable Seller Benefit Plan
prior to the Closing and (ii) credit all Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums
and deductible payments and co-payments paid by such person, in each case,
under the comparable Seller Benefit Plan prior to the Closing during the plan
year in which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to
which any such person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or
she has reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any health insurance plans of
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer for such year.

 



 

(c) _WARN and Corresponding State Laws_. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall retain a sufficient number of Employees hired by it hereunder for a
sufficient period of time so as not to impose any liability or notice
requirements on Seller or any of its Affiliates under the WARN Act. Buyer
shall be solely responsible for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at
the option of Seller, to defend Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
Affiliates from and against any Liability under WARN or any similar state Law,
to any Employee who is found to have suffered an "employment loss" under WARN
on or after the Closing Date as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the actions of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and against
any and all other related Liabilities, including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, arising out of or resulting from the actions of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, or their failure to serve sufficient notice pursuant to
WARN or any similar state Law.

 



 

(d) _Vacation and Other Paid Time Off_. Following the Closing, Seller shall
timely pay, or cause to be paid, to each Transferred Employee, an amount equal
to the value of such Transferred Employees accrued and unused paid time off
as of immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) _Disability Benefits_. Seller shall be responsible for continuing any
salary continuation benefits for any Employee on short-term leave immediately
prior to the Closing Date, in accordance with the applicable Seller policy.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) _401(k) Plan_. Effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing, Buyer shall permit participation by the Transferred Employees in
Buyers tax-qualified defined contribution plan or plans with a cash or
deferred feature (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_") for the benefit of each
Transferred Employee who, as of immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible
to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan maintained by
Seller (collectively, the " _Seller 401(k) Plans_") to the extent permitted
under the Buyer 401(k) Plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,
Seller 401(k) Plans shall, to the extent permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of
the Code, make distributions available to Transferred Employees, and Buyer
401(k) Plan shall accept any such distribution (including loans) as a rollover
distribution if so directed by the Transferred Employee to the extent such a
rollover is permissible under the Buyer 401(k) Plan. The parties agree to
cooperate so as not to place any loan with respect to a Transferred Employees
rollover account into default during the period from the Closing Date until
the rollover is completed; _provided_ that such employee continues making loan
repayments on a timely basis during such period in accordance with the
established procedures of Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable.

 



 

(g) _Employees on Visa_. On or before October 1, 2018, Seller shall provide to
Buyer a true, correct and complete list in all material respects of all
Employees who, as of the date hereof, are working in the United States
pursuant to a visa.

 



 

(h) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 4.2_, express or
implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof or other Person, any rights or remedies, including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period, or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement
or a right of any employee or beneficiary of such employee or other Person
under an employee benefit plan that such employee or beneficiary or other
Person would not otherwise have under the terms of that employee benefit plan
without regard to this Agreement.

 



 

4.3 _Use of Seller Marks_. From and after the Closing, Buyer shall ensure that
the Business ceases to appear to have, and Buyer shall not hold itself out as
having, any affiliation with Seller or any of its Affiliates, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 4.3. Buyer shall, as soon as practicable,
but in no event later than six (6) months following the Closing Date, cease to
make (or to permit any Person to make) any use of the names and marks of
Seller and its Affiliates (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Business
IP being transferred hereunder), including "TravelCenters of America", "Petro
Stopping Centers" or "TA-Petro," the trademarks listed on _Schedule 1.2(p)_
hereof, and any name, logo or mark related thereto or containing, comprising
or derived from any of the foregoing, including any names or marks similar
thereto or dilutive thereof (the " _Seller Marks_ "), including by removing,
striking over, or otherwise obliterating all Seller Marks from all assets and
other materials related to the Business, including any vehicles, business
cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs,
promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and
other materials and systems. Any use of Seller Marks prior to the expiration
of such six (6) month period shall be in a form and manner, and with standards
of quality equivalent in all material respects to that in effect for the
Seller Marks as of the Closing Date, and all goodwill arising therefrom shall
inure to the sole benefit of Seller. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that the remedy

 



      
 

 



 

at Law for any breach of the requirements of this _Section 4.3_, whether or
not material, may be inadequate, and agrees that, without intending to limit
any additional rights or remedies that may be available under applicable Law
or otherwise, Seller or its Affiliates shall be entitled to seek temporary or
permanent injunction, without proof of actual damage, with respect to any
Claim which may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this _Section
4.3_.

 



 

4.4 _Insurance and Casualty_. Seller shall keep the Assets insured, at
Sellers expense, with such policy types and coverage amounts as Seller
maintains in the Ordinary Course of Business until the Closing or termination
of this Agreement pursuant to its terms. Upon any damage to or destruction of
the Properties or any portion thereof before the Closing, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer of such fact. Buyer shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement and receive the return of the Deposit as a result of any such
damage or destruction to the extent such constitutes a Material Adverse
Effect. In the event Buyer makes no election to terminate, Seller shall (a)
assign to Buyer at the Closing all of Sellers rights to the insurance
proceeds, if any, under Sellers insurance policies covering the affected
Properties, (b) pay to Buyer any recoveries from third parties pursuant to
indemnification (or otherwise) with respect thereto, net of any expenses
incurred by the Seller in obtaining such third party payment, and (c) pay to
Buyer the amount of any deductible under Sellers insurance policies covering
the affected Properties with respect to any such damage or destruction.

 



 

4.5 _Condemnation_. If, during the period from the date hereof until the
Closing, all or any portion of a Property is taken, or noticed for taking, by
eminent domain, Seller shall promptly give Buyer written notice thereof. Buyer
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and receive the return of the
Deposit as a result of any such taking or notice thereof to the extent that
such constitutes a Material Adverse Effect. In the event Buyer makes no
election to terminate, Seller shall assign to Buyer at the Closing all of
Sellers right, title and interest in and to all awards, if any, for any such
taking, and Buyer shall be entitled to receive and keep all awards for the
taking of the Properties or portion thereof.

 



 

4.6 _Release of Seller Guaranties_. Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, but shall not be obligated to incur any additional
liability or cost, to obtain a release of the Seller Parties effective as of
the Closing (or as soon thereafter as practicable) from all obligations and
Liability under any guaranty and/or indemnity issued by any Seller Party in
connection with the list of Assumed Contracts and Real Property Leases (each,
a " _Seller Guaranty_ ") set forth on _Schedule 4.6_ from and after the
Closing; _provided_ that Buyer instead may elect to cause to be provided to
the applicable Seller Party an indemnity from and against any and all
obligations and Liability under each Seller Guaranty for which a release is
not provided effective as of Closing. In the event Buyer elects to provide an
indemnity as per the prior sentence of this _Section_ , then at Closing, Buyer
shall provide an indemnity, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Seller, from a creditworthy party reasonably acceptable to Seller, from and
against any and all obligations and Liability under the applicable Seller
Guaranties. This _Section 4.6_ shall survive Closing.

 



 

4.7 _License to Seller of Business IP_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, shall and does hereby grant to Seller and its Affiliates a non-
exclusive, sublicenseable, transferable, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and
royalty-free license to use, for a period of nine (9) months following the
Closing, the Business IP at or in connection with the travel centers that, at
Closing

 



      
 

 



 

or thereafter, are owned by (or operated by or on behalf of) Seller or any of
its Affiliates (or any of their respective successors or assigns). All
goodwill associated with trademarks included in the Business IP arising from
use of the Business IP pursuant to the foregoing license in this _Section
4.7_ shall inure to the sole benefit of Buyer, and Seller and its Affiliates
shall use such trademarks at a level of quality equivalent in all material
respects to that in effect for such trademarks as of the Closing. For purposes
of clarity, nothing in this _Section 4.7_ shall preclude any uses of the
Business IP by Seller and its Affiliates that are required or otherwise not
prohibited under applicable Law, including references to the Business IP in
historical, tax, and similar records.

 



 

4.8 _Section 1031 Exchange_. Upon the request of Seller, and without material
additional cost or any liability to Buyer, Buyer shall take all such actions
as may be reasonably requested by Seller in order to effectuate all or any
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a forward or
reverse like-kind exchange for the benefit of Seller in accordance with
Section 1031 of the Code and, in the case of a reverse exchange, Internal
Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Such actions may include, Buyers
execution and delivery of a new "stand-alone" purchase and sale agreement
(each, an " _LKE Agreement_ ") with respect to each individual Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property identified by Seller (each, an " _LKE
Property_ "). Each LKE Agreement shall be in a form and substance
substantially similar to this Agreement and it shall not change or modify the
rights or obligations of the parties hereunder in any material respect.
Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of any such LKE Agreement,
Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver an amendment to this Agreement to
remove the LKE Property from the properties required to be transferred by
Seller under this Agreement and to reduce the Purchase Price by an amount
equal to the "Purchase Price" under the LKE Agreement, provided all other
representations, warranties and obligations of Seller with respect to such LKE
Property under this Agreement shall continue without modification. In
furtherance of this Section 4.8 and notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement or any LKE Agreement to the contrary, Seller may assign its rights
under this Agreement or any LKE Agreement to a "qualified intermediary" or an
"exchange accommodation titleholder" in order to facilitate a forward or
reverse like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code, and Buyer agrees to
execute and deliver an acknowledgment and consent to any such assignment by
Seller of its rights under this Agreement or any such LKE Agreement to a
qualified intermediary or an exchange accommodation titleholder; _provided_ ,
however, such assignment shall not relieve Seller of any of its obligations
hereunder or thereunder.

 



 

4.9 _Litigation Assistance_. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in
the defense or prosecution of any actual or threatened claims or proceedings
now in existence or which may be brought or threatened in the future against
or on behalf of Seller that relate to events or occurrences affecting the
Assets or Business that transpired prior to the Closing (it being understood
that Seller shall have the right to control any such litigation, disputes or
matters involving Excluded Liabilities). Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to
make available to Seller any third-party Transferred Employee to the extent
any such claims relate to the Transferred Employees relationship with Seller,
services performed or required to be performed for Seller by the Transferred
Employee, or other pertinent knowledge possessed by the Transferred Employee.
Seller shall retain all rights to recover moneys due or damages being sought
by Seller under any such litigation or disputes.

 



      
 

 



 

4.10 _Transfer of Assets, Licenses and Permits and Environmental Insurance_

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Asset or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such assignment,
without the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or
other contravention of such Asset, as applicable, or in any way adversely
affect the rights of any party thereunder. Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
any efforts of Buyer to obtain such consents after the execution of this
Agreement until each such consent is obtained; provided that Seller shall not
be required to incur any expense in connection with such efforts. If any such
consent is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Buyer in any efforts of the assignee to obtain such consent as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date; provided that Seller shall not be required
to incur any expense in connection with such efforts. In addition, if
requested by Buyer, Seller and its Affiliates, at Buyers sole cost and
expense, will cooperate with Buyer in a commercially reasonable arrangement
under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume and be responsible for
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, occupancy and/or use agreements or sub-leasing to
the assignee party and enforcement by Seller or its Affiliates for the benefit
of Buyer of any and all rights of the assigning party against a third party
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall be required to pay any form of consideration to
any third party to obtain any consent except as specifically required by the
applicable Asset.

 



 

(b) The Seller and the Buyer acknowledge that certain Licenses and Permits
issued by Governmental Entities are required to carry on certain aspects of
the Business following Closing. If any such Licenses and Permits are not
transferable to Buyer at the Closing, and replacement Licenses and Permits
have not otherwise been obtained by Buyer on or prior to the Closing, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law and at no unreimbursed material cost or
expense, Seller and its Affiliates shall maintain and comply with all such
Licenses and Permits, and, at Buyers option, shall enter into a mutually
acceptable arrangement with Buyer or its Affiliates to permit the continued
operation of the Business as currently conducted at the applicable Property or
Properties, until Buyer notifies Seller that (i) Buyer has obtained the
requisite consents, novations, or approvals to transfer such Licenses or
Permits, or (ii) Buyer has obtained replacement Licenses and Permits, so as to
enable the Buyer to carry on the Business after Closing as currently
conducted. Seller and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and
take all actions reasonably necessary to obtain any consents, novations,
approvals, licenses or authorizations from a Governmental Entity to transfer
the Licenses and Permits to Buyer (to the extent permitted by Law) or that are
otherwise reasonably required for Buyer to hold and use such Licenses and
Permits from and after Closing in substantially the same form as they are held
and used by Seller and its Affiliates as of the date hereof, and to allow
Buyer to conduct the Business as currently conducted from and after the
Closing; provided that Seller shall not be required to incur any expense in
connection with such efforts.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) After the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain coverage for
Buyer as an additional insured under Beazley Eclipse Pollution Liability
Policy Number W21A5180101 (the " _Beazley Policy_ ") with respect to the
Business until such time as Buyer is reasonably able to obtain its own policy
for the Business; provided that Buyer shall promptly and diligently take all
commercial reasonable efforts to obtain its own environmental insurance policy
for the Business to the extent environmental insurance is required under
Environmental Laws for the continued operation of the Business and to maintain
eligibility under Government Remediation Funds; provided further that Seller
shall not be required to incur any expense in connection with the above
efforts and shall have no obligation to provide the benefits of the Beazley
Policy to Seller in the event that Beazley does not agree to Seller as an
additional insured; and provided further that Buyer covenants and agrees to
take all actions required to maintain compliance with the Beazley Policy.
During any such period as the Buyer may be an additional insured under the
Beazley Policy, in the event that proceeds from the Beazley Policy are used to
fund claims for releases and other pollution events occurring after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly reimburse to Seller any such proceeds to
the extent such payments limit Sellers ability to recover for other claims
that may arise under the Beazley Policy.

 



 

4.11 _Parent Guarantee_.

 



 

(a) Whenever in this Agreement the performance of or compliance with a
covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement (the " _Seller Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") is expressed to be required by Seller or its Affiliates,
Seller Parent shall cause Seller and its Affiliates to punctually perform or
comply with such Seller Guaranteed Obligation. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, if any Seller Guaranteed Obligation is not performed by Seller
or its Affiliates when due, Seller Parent shall (subject to the provisions of
this Agreement), within ten (10) Business Days following the written request
of Buyer when such Seller Guaranteed Obligation is required to be performed
pursuant to this Agreement, (i) pay or cause Seller or its Affiliates to pay
in full in cash any of such Seller Guaranteed Obligation that is in the nature
of a payment obligation, and (ii) perform or cause Seller or its Affiliates to
perform any of such Seller Guaranteed Obligation that is not in the nature of
a payment obligation, to the extent due but not already paid or performed. In
the event Seller Parent fails to so pay or perform (or cause such payment or
performance by Seller or its Affiliates) such Seller Guaranteed Obligation
(subject to the provisions of this Agreement), Buyer may, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to Buyer in respect of
such failure to so pay or perform (or cause such payment or performance by
Seller or its Affiliates), thereafter initiate a proceeding to pursue any
rights available thereto against Seller or its Affiliates, or Seller Parent,
or both (at the election of Buyer) in respect of all Seller Guaranteed
Obligations that have not then been paid or performed within ten (10) Business
Days following the written request of Buyer contemplated by the preceding
sentence. Buyer may continue to pursue such rights and remedies in respect of
such Seller Guaranteed Obligation until the earlier of (x) the payment or
performance of such Seller Guaranteed Obligation in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and (y) the final disposition of such proceeding
in a final, non-appealable order of a court of

 



      
 

 



 

competent jurisdiction or binding settlement agreement. Seller Parents
obligations under this _Section 4.11(a)_ shall survive the Closing.

covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement (the " _Buyer Guaranteed
Obligations_ ") is expressed to be required by Buyer or its Affiliates, Buyer
Parent shall cause Buyer and its Affiliates to punctually perform or comply
with such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, if any Buyer Guaranteed Obligation is not performed by Buyer or its
Affiliates when due, Buyer Parent shall (subject to the provisions of this
Agreement), within ten (10) Business Days following the written request of
Seller when such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation is required to be performed
pursuant to this Agreement, (i) pay or cause Buyer or its Affiliates to pay in
full in cash any of such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation that is in the nature of
a payment obligation, and (ii) perform or cause Buyer or its Affiliates to
perform any of such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation that is not in the nature of a
payment obligation, to the extent due but not already paid or performed. In
the event Buyer Parent fails to so pay or perform (or cause such payment or
performance by Buyer or its Affiliates) such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation
(subject to the provisions of this Agreement), Seller may, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to Seller in respect
of such failure to so pay or perform (or cause such payment or performance by
Buyer or its Affiliates), thereafter initiate a proceeding to pursue any
rights available thereto against Buyer or its Affiliates, or Buyer Parent, or
both (at the election of Seller) in respect of all Buyer Guaranteed
Obligations that have not then been paid or performed within ten (10) Business
Days following the written request of Seller contemplated by the preceding
sentence. Seller may continue to pursue such rights and remedies in respect of
such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation until the earlier of (x) the payment or
performance of such Buyer Guaranteed Obligation in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and (y) the final disposition of such proceeding
in a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or
binding settlement agreement. Buyer Parents obligations under this _Section
4.11(b)_ shall survive the Closing.

 



 

4.12 _Exclusivity_. From the date hereof until the Closing or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Seller and Seller Parent shall not (and the
Seller and Seller Parent shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, consultants, financial advisors,
accountants, legal counsel and other representatives, as applicable, not to),
directly or indirectly, (i) submit, solicit, initiate, encourage or discuss
any proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) or enter into any
agreement or accept any offer relating to or consummate any (a)
reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of the Business, (b) merger or
consolidation involving the Business, (c) purchase or sale of any Assets
(other than the purchase and sale of inventory and the purchase of capital
equipment in the Ordinary Course of Business), or (d) similar transaction or
business combination involving the Business or the Assets (each of the
foregoing transactions described in clauses (a) through (d), a " _Competing
Transaction_ ") or (ii) furnish any material information with respect to,
assist or participate in or facilitate in any other manner any effort or
attempt by any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates) to do or seek to
do any of the foregoing. With respect to the Persons with whom discussions or
negotiations have been terminated, Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the return or destruction of, in accordance with the terms

 



      
 

 



 

of an applicable confidentiality agreement, any confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person by Seller, its Affiliates, or any of
their respective representatives.

Buyer by execution and delivery of an Assignment of Reimbursement Claims in a
form reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " _Assignment of
Reimbursement Claims_ ") any rights to apply for, receive, retain, or use in
any manner reimbursement funds available from any Government Remediation Fund
with respect to remediation occurring on or after the Closing Date at the
Properties, in each case to the extent assignable. Seller and Buyer agree to
cooperate to effectuate the purpose of this _Section 4.13_.

efforts to provide, and shall direct its officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, financial advisors, accountants, and other representatives
to use reasonable best efforts to provide, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement of debt financing for
purposes of the transactions contemplated hereby, including by use reasonable
best efforts to provide information, reasonable assistance, reasonable access
and/or other cooperation in connection with Buyers financing arrangements,
including in relation to syndication, ratings, guarantees and security,
corporate authorizations and "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations in relation to such financing arrangements, in each case
to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including this _Section 4.14_) nothing
in this Agreement (including this _Section 4.14_) shall require any such
cooperation to the extent that it would: (A) require the Seller or any
Subsidiary to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse any expenses or
otherwise incur any liabilities or give any indemnities; (B) unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries; (C) require any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
or approve any agreement or other documentation in connection with Buyers
financing; (D) require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) to approve or authorize
Buyers financing; (E) require any action that would conflict with or violate
the organizational documents of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws,
orders or the contracts governing the existing indebtedness of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or result in the contravention of, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or default
under, any contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; (F)
cause any representation or warranty or covenant in this Agreement to be
breached by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; (G) cause any director,

(i) promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all of its fees and
expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any
cooperation contemplated by this _Section 4.14_ and (ii) indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries and its and their officers, directors,
managers, employees, agents, financial advisors, accountants, and other
representatives against any claim, loss, damage, injury, liability, judgment,
award, penalty, fine, Tax, cost, expense or settlement payment incurred as a
result of, or in connection with, such cooperation or Buyers financing and
any information used in connection therewith. All non-public or other
confidential information provided by the Seller and

 



      
 

 



 

its Affiliates and officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, financial

4.14 _shall be kept confidential in accordance with the terms hereof.

total of all Losses incurred by the Seller Parties under this Agreement
exceeds, in the aggregate, the Bucket, after which the Seller Parties shall
have the right to recover from Buyer all Losses incurred by the Seller Parties
in excess of the Bucket up to an amount equal to the Liability Cap.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, other than in
respect of _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, _(iii)_ , and _(iv)_ , in no event shall
aggregate Liability of Buyer under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise
exceed the Liability Cap.

 



 

(ii) The obligations of Buyer under _Section 7.2(a)_ shall survive Closing;
provided, however, that with respect to Buyers obligations under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_, such obligations shall terminate as to each Surviving
Representation when such Surviving Representation terminates pursuant to
_Section 2.3(b)_; provided further, however, that such obligations shall not
terminate with respect to an alleged breach of a Surviving Representation as
to which Seller shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period (A) made a claim by delivering an Indemnification Notice to Seller in
accordance with the terms hereof, and (B) filed suit against Buyer.

 



 

(iii) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the facts giving rise to more than one
right to indemnification.

 



 

(iv) For purposes of computing the amount of Losses, the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made
without any qualifications as to materiality, material adverse effect or
similar materiality qualification set forth in such representations or
warranties or any defined term contained therein.

 



 

7.3 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between Buyer and Seller_.
Following the discovery of any facts or conditions that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which indemnification under this
_Section 7_ can be obtained, the Party seeking indemnification under this
_Section 7_ (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall, reasonably promptly
thereafter, provide written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), setting forth the specific facts and
circumstances, in reasonable detail, relating to such Loss or Losses, the
amount of Loss or Losses (or a non-binding, reasonable estimate thereof if the
actual amount is not known or not capable of reasonable calculation) and the
specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the Indemnified Party is
relying in seeking such indemnification (an " _Indemnification Notice_ ");
provided, however, that any delay or failure in providing the Indemnification
Notice shall not preclude the Indemnified Party from seeking indemnification
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party suffers actual prejudice as a
result of such failure.

 



      
 

 



 

7.4 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice_. In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any third party, including any Governmental Entity
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party must provide an
Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying Party relating to the Third Party
Claim reasonably promptly after the Indemnified Partys receipt of notice of
the Third Party Claim, but in no event more than twenty (20) Business Days
after being served with any summons, complaint or similar legal process;
provided, however, that failure to give timely notice shall not release the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party suffers actual prejudice as a result of such failure.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
reasonably promptly and in any event within two (2) Business Days after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents,
including all court papers, received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) _Defense_. If a Third Party Claim is made against the Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
negotiation, settlement and defense thereof with counsel of its choice and, if
the Indemnifying Party so chooses, to assume the negotiation, settlement and
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable
for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
Indemnified Party for the fees and expenses of counsel subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof; provided,
however, that (i) prior to assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall provide to the Indemnified Party an undertaking
stating that such Indemnifying Party is able to and will assume the payment of
all defense fees and costs and (ii) the Indemnifying Partys assumption of the
defense of such Third Party Claim shall not signify any agreement, obligation
or commitment on the part of the Indemnifying Party to assume or pay any
amount awarded to a claimant in respect of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it
being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,
then the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party has not within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of
an Indemnification Notice relating to a Third Party Claim, chosen to assume
defense of a Third Party Claim or fails to defend such Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, then the Indemnified Party shall (upon

 



      
 

 



 

further written notice) have the right to defend such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not take any action the purpose of which is to
prejudice the defense of any claim subject to indemnification hereunder or to
induce a third party to assert a claim subject to indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(c) _Settlement of Third Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed),
unless such settlement provides solely for monetary damages or other monetary
payments that will be made by the Indemnifying Party and does not provide for
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent may be withheld in the Indemnifying Partys sole discretion).

 



 

7.5 _Environmental Claim Procedures And Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Seller shall only be required to indemnify the Buyer Parties against any
Losses arising out of a breach of Section 2.1(g) or the Excluded Environmental
Liabilities to the extent that:

 



 

(i) the investigation, remediation, corrective action or other response action
(the " _Remedial Work_ ") is required by a Governmental Entity or to resolve a
Third Party Claim under an Environmental Law;

 



 

(ii) the Remedial Work is conducted so as to comply with the least stringent
remedial standards that would be applicable given the use of the property as
of the day before the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) the Remedial Work is the minimum required to achieve compliance with the
requirements if a Governmental Entity or to resolve a Third Party Claim; and

 



 

(iv) the Remedial Work is conducted using the most cost effective methods and
measures (including deed restrictions and other activity and use limitations)
allowed under Environmental Law.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Parties against any
Losses arising out of a breach of Section 2.1(g) or the Excluded Environmental
Liabilities to the extent that such Losses arise or result from:

 



 

(i) any increase in the cost of Remedial Work due to an act or omission by the
Buyer Parties or any of their agents, employees or other persons given access
to the properties under their direction or control;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any capital improvements or modifications associated with any property
occurring after the Closing Date;

 



 

(iii) any change in use of a property or the operations conducted thereon
(including the closure or sale of a business, or the construction or
replacement of structures or equipment) occurring after the Closing Date;

 



 

(iv) any investigation, sampling, assessment, study or other Remedial Work
undertaken that is not required by applicable Environmental Law;

 



 

(v) any disclosure or reporting to a Governmental Entity or Third Party that
is not required by applicable Environmental Law

 



 

(c) All claims by the Buyer Parties for indemnification for Losses arising out
of a breach of Section 2.1(g) or the Excluded Environmental Liabilities shall
be treated as Third-Party Claims governed by Section 7.4 of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Buyer Parties shall provide reasonable access to the properties for
purposes of the Remedial Work, cooperate in obtaining third-party consents
and, if requested, execute and permit to be recorded and implemented
reasonable institutional controls, engineering controls, remediation systems,
deed restrictions and other use or activity limitations as will facilitate the
completion of the Remedial Work

 



 

(e) The Buyer Parties covenant and agree to take all commercially reasonable
measures to ensure that the Assets and the Business obtain and maintain
eligibility for any applicable Government Remediation Fund and comply with
other relevant underground storage tank laws during the period that any
Excluded Environmental Liabilities are subject to Sellers obligations under
this Agreement.

 



 

7.6 _Insurance And Other Sources Of Recovery_. The obligation of the
Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified Party against any Losses under
this _Section 7_ shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party from third party insurers and
Government Remediation Funds with respect to such Losses.

 



 

7.7 _Effect of Investigation_. The Buyer Parties shall not be entitled to
recover Losses arising under _Section 7.1(a)_ to the extent Buyer had actual
knowledge, at or prior to the Closing Date, of a fact or series of related
facts that it reasonably believed would be a breach of a representation or
warranty made by Seller in this Agreement.

 



 

7.7 _Duty to Mitigate_. In all cases in which a Person is entitled to be
indemnified in accordance with this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall be
under a duty to take all commercially reasonable measures to mitigate all
Losses of which it is aware. Without limiting the foregoing, each Indemnified
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amount
available under applicable insurance coverage for any Losses for which an
indemnity claim is being made. No Indemnified Party may take any action for
the purpose of prejudicing the defense of any claim subject to indemnification
hereunder or to induce a third party to assess a claim subject to
indemnification hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

7.8 _Exclusive Remedy, etc._ From and after the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of this _Section 7_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to a Partys breach
of its representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the
Excluded Environmental Liabilities. No party shall be entitled to a rescission
of this Agreement (or any related agreements) related to the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL EITHER PARTY BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR
DAMAGES BASED SOLELY UPON DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF THE BUSINESS OR ANY MULTIPLE
THEREOF, ANY MULTIPLES OF REVENUE OR EBITDA, LOST BUSINESS, OR LOSS OF PROFITS
OR GOODWILL, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM.

 



 

7.9 _Fraud_. Nothing in this Agreement (including this _Article 7_) shall
limit or restrict any partys right to maintain or recover any amounts in
connection with any action or claim based upon fraud.

 



 

 **8.** **CLOSING**

 



 

8.1 _Closing Date_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms and conditions, and provided that the conditions to
the Closing set forth in _Section 5_ and _Section 6_ are satisfied or
waived, the closing with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place through a closing escrow at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on December 5, 2018, as the same may be extended to a date (not later
than the Outside Date) to be mutually agreed upon by the parties if the
conditions to closing cannot be satisfied on or before December 5, 2018 (the
date of Closing, hereinafter, the " _Closing Date_ "). For accounting
purposes, the Closing shall be deemed to be effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern
time, on the Closing Date so that any revenue and expenses accrued on the
Closing Date with respect to the Assets and the Business will be for the
account of Buyer. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller
shall deposit into escrow all executed documents required under _Section
8.2(a)_ and Buyer shall deposit into escrow all executed documents required
under _Section 8.3(a)_, in each case no later than two (2) Business Days
prior to the scheduled Closing Date. In the event that Buyer or Seller fail to
so deposit, the Party that does not fail to so deposit shall have the right to
extend the Closing Date for each day of delay; provided however that in no
event shall the delay exceed five (5) Business Days.

 



 

8.2 _Items to be Delivered by Seller_.

 



 

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,

(b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Settlement
Statement executed by Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.** **DEFAULT; REMEDIES; TERMINATION**

 



 

9.1 _Default by Buyer_. If Buyer fails to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement required to be performed by it, when required, on or before the
Closing Date for any reason other than Sellers default, and such default by
Buyer shall continue for five (5) Business Days (or one (1) Business Day if
the default relates to a Closing deliverable) following receipt by Buyer of
written notice thereof from Seller, Seller shall have the right to either (a)
terminate this Agreement and receive the Deposit as liquidated damages and not
as a penalty (Buyer and Seller agree that actual damages would in such event
be difficult to determine and the Deposit is a reasonable estimate of such
damages), or (b) enforce specific performance of Buyers obligations under
this Agreement (provided that such action for specific performance is filed
and served no later than the date that is sixty (60) days after the date upon
which the Closing was scheduled to occur); _provided_ that Seller is not in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. In connection with any termination
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, Seller will not, under any circumstance, have
the right to pursue or recover from Buyer any monetary damages and any claim
to monetary damages is hereby expressly waived by Seller. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that Seller shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to enforce specifically against any Debt Financing Source the
terms and provisions of any financing arrangements or commitment between any
Debt Financing Source and Buyer.

 



 

9.2 _Default by Seller_. If Seller fails to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement required to be performed by it, when required, on or
before the Closing Date for any reason other than Buyers default, and such
default by Seller continues for five (5) Business Days (or one (1) Business
Day if the default relates to a Closing deliverable) following receipt by
Seller of written notice thereof from Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to either
(a) terminate this Agreement and receive the return of the Deposit, or (b)
enforce specific performance of Sellers obligations under this Agreement
(provided that such action for specific performance is filed and served no
later than the date that is sixty (60) days after the date upon which the
Closing was scheduled to occur); _provided_ that Buyer is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. In connection with any termination pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)_, Buyer will not, under any circumstance, have the right to
pursue or recover from Seller any monetary damages and any claim to monetary
damages is hereby expressly waived by Buyer.

 



 

9.3 _Termination by Either Party_. Either Buyer or Seller may terminate this
Agreement if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated
prior to March 31, 2019 (the " _Outside Date_ ") provided that such party is
not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. In connection with any termination
pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, (i) the Deposit shall be paid to Seller as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty (Buyer and Seller agree that actual
damages would in such event be difficult to determine and the Deposit is a
reasonable estimate of such damages) so long as Seller is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement (in which case the Deposit will be returned to
Buyer), and (ii) neither Buyer nor Seller will, under any circumstance have
the right to pursue or recover from the other party any monetary damages or
any specific performance and any claim to monetary damages or specific
performance is hereby expressly waived by each party.

 



      
 

 



 

9.4 _Deposit_. In the event Buyer fails to deliver the Deposit in accordance
with _Section 1.4_ hereof, Seller shall be entitled, upon written notice to
Buyer, to terminate this Agreement and receive from Buyer immediately upon
demand an amount equal to the Deposit as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty (Buyer and Seller agree that actual damages would in such event be
difficult to determine and that such amount is a reasonable estimate of such
damages); _provided_ that, if Buyer delivers to Seller written or electronic
evidence that Buyer has authorized transmission of the Deposit to Seller in
accordance with _Section 1.4_, and the Deposit has not been received by
Seller in the time frame set forth in _Section 1.4_ due to circumstances
outside Buyers control, this _Section 9.4_ shall not apply so long as Buyer
continues to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Deposit to be
received by Seller as soon as practicable (and in all events the Deposit is
received within five (5) Business Days from the date hereof). This _Section
9.4_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.** **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

10.1 _Publicity_. Notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
(i) the Parties agree that, from and after the date of this Agreement, no
public release, written statement or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by a Party without the prior
written consent of the other, except for any such release or announcement that
is required by Law, which release or announcement shall be made available to
the other for its review as soon as reasonably practicable prior to such
disclosure, (ii) Seller may, at any time and without requirement of any
consultation with, or consent from, Buyer, (a) make internal announcements to
employees and make disclosures in any document filed with any securities
regulator (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), including,
without limitation, a Form 8-K, and (b) issue any press release or make any
announcement or statement to its or its direct or indirect investors or that
is required or advisable in accordance with Law or any listing agreement with,
or the listing rules of, any national securities exchange or trading market,
and (iii) Buyer may, at any time and without requirement of any consultation
with, or consent from, Seller, disclose this Agreement, and any documents,
instruments or agreements to be issued or delivered in connection with
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated herein and therein, to any Debt
Financing Source; provided that such Debt Financing Source agrees or has
agreed to be bound by a confidentiality arrangement with Buyer that contains
substantially similar confidentiality undertakings to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

10.2 _Assignment_. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, neither Party may directly or indirectly assign or transfer (or
permit the direct or indirect assignment or transfer, whether in connection
with, or as a result of, the assignment or transfer of a direct or indirect
equity interest or otherwise) its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
in whole or in part, voluntarily or by operation of Law, without the prior
written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that (i) Buyer or any of its Affiliates may
assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any of
its Affiliates or in connection with any disposition or transfer of all or any
portion of the Assets, in each case without the consent of any other Person;
_provided_ , any such assigning Person shall remain fully liable under this
Agreement for such Persons obligations and responsibilities hereunder and
(ii) Buyer and its subsidiaries shall be free to assign its rights under this
Agreement as collateral security to any provider of finance to the Buyer or
its Affiliates without the consent of any other Person, _provided_ , any such
assigning Person shall

 



      
 

 



 

remain fully liable under this Agreement for such Persons obligations and
responsibilities hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall not
have the right to consummate any assignment under this _Section 10.2_ to the
extent the same would inhibit or restrict in any material respect, Sellers
ability, pursuant to _Section 4.8_ hereof, to effectuate all or any part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a forward or reverse like-
kind exchange for the benefit of Seller in accordance with Section 1031 of the
Code and, in the case of a reverse exchange, Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 2000-37.

 



 

10.3 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided herein
(including as to the Escrow Agent with respect to the provisions of _Section
1.4_ and _Section 7_), this Agreement is not intended to and does not confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Debt Financing Sources
will be deemed third party beneficiaries of the last sentence of _Section
9.1_, _Section 10.2_, this proviso in _Section 10.3_, the second sentence of
_Section 10.4_, the last sentence of _Section 10.5_, and _Section 10.19_.

 



 

10.4 _Amendment._ No modifications, amendments or supplements to this
Agreement shall be valid and binding unless set forth in a written agreement
executed and delivered by the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, any amendment or modification of any provision of
which the Debt Financing Sources are made third party beneficiaries pursuant
to _Section 10.3_ or that otherwise affects the rights of the Debt Financing
Sources will not be effective without the prior written consent of all the
Debt Financing Sources.

 



 

10.5 _Waiver_. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by the Party so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement and in any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and in connection with the Closing under this Agreement. The waiver
by any Party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, any waiver of any provision of which the
Debt Financing Sources are made third party beneficiaries pursuant to _Section
10.3_ in a manner that adversely affects any Debt Financing Source or that
otherwise adversely affects the rights of the Debt Financing Sources will not
be effective without the prior written consent of the adversely affected Debt
Financing Sources.

 



 

10.6 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, delivery
