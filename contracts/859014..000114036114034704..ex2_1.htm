ARTICLE III

  


 

  

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK;_

  

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

  

  

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub:

  

  

  

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") held by the
Company, if any, or by any of its Subsidiaries or held, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

  

    

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares canceled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a_ )) shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount per share of Company Common Stock in cash equal to (i) $10.43 minus
(ii) the Per Share Spin-Off Taxes (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
6.20_ ), without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). Each share of Company
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall as of the Effective
Time no longer be outstanding and shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist, and the holders of certificates (the "Certificates") or book-
entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

  

  

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Acquisition Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, no par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

  

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or similar event, or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period (other than pursuant
to the Spin-Off), the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. Nothing in this _Section 3.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit any
party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  


 

  

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company (the "Paying Agent"),
the identity and the terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable
to the Company (provided the transfer agent and registrar for the Company
Common Stock shall be deemed acceptable to the Company), for the payment of
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or substantially
concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ (the
"Aggregate Merger Consideration," and such Aggregate Merger Consideration as
deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by
_Section 3.1(b)_ , Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to
fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ , except as expressly provided for
in this Agreement.

  

    

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth Business Day
thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent and Acquisition Sub) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall be in the
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify).

  

  

(c) _Timing of Exchange_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon the later to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent's receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith
canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  


 

  

(d) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent for transfer or for any other reason, the holder of any such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be given a copy of the letter of
transmittal referred to in _Section 3.2(b)_ and instructed to comply with the
instructions in that letter of transmittal in order to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Article III.

  

    

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon written demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of
their claims for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  

  

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no
such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article III_ , and following any losses Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such
investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) such investments shall be in short-
term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more
than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed
by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

  

  

(h) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
and any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the Treasury Regulations or any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

(i) _No Further Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with
a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

    

Section 3.3 _Company Options, Company Stock Units_ _, Cash Incentive
Compensation Awards_.

  

  

  

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, unless otherwise
agreed between Parent and any individual holder of a Company Option, each
Company Option (whether or not vested) that is outstanding shall be canceled
and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive in exchange therefore as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable
Law to be withheld) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (treating all performance
conditions as having been met) and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration, over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option (the "Option Cash Payment"). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective Time, each Company Option
having an exercise price per share equal to or more than the Merger
Consideration shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall not be entitled
to any payment or other consideration in respect thereof. Following the
Effective Time, any Company Option canceled in accordance with this _Section
3.3_ shall no longer be exercisable and shall only entitle the Company Option
holder to the Option Cash Payment, which shall be paid as of, or promptly
following, the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to pay, the Option Cash Payment through its
payroll system as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

  

  

(b) _Treatment of Company Stock Units_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, any
vesting conditions or restrictions applicable to each Company Stock Unit
outstanding immediately prior thereto shall lapse and the holder thereof shall
receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other
Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Unit and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the "Stock Unit
Payment"). The Surviving Corporation shall pay, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to pay, such Stock Unit Payment through its payroll system as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

  

  

  

(c) _Treatment of Company Cash Incentive Compensation Awards_. As of the
Effective Time, any unpaid incentive compensation (each, an "Unpaid Cash
Incentive Award") which has been allocated or awarded to any Company employee
with respect to fiscal year 2014 under the Company's Fiscal Year (FY) 2014
Executive Incentive Plan and which, as of the Effective Time, is contingent
only upon the continued employment of the applicable Company employee to a
subsequent date, shall entitle the applicable Company employee to receive an
amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld) equal to the amount of his
or her Unpaid Cash Incentive Award; _provided_ that the aggregate amount of
the Unpaid Cash Incentive Awards shall not exceed $1,675,000. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to pay, such
payment in settlement of the Unpaid Cash Incentive Awards as of, or promptly
following, the Effective Time.

  

    

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.3(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the Compuware Corporation
Amended and Restated 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Compuware Corporation
2001 Broad Based Stock Option Plan, the Compuware Corporation Fiscal 1998
Stock Option Plan, the Compuware Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-
Employee Directors (the "Company Equity Plans") and the Inactive Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other program or
arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall take
all necessary actions in furtherance of the foregoing. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no
participant in the Company Equity Plans or the Inactive Plans or other
programs or arrangements shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
thereof.

  

  

  

(e) _Freeze and Termination of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, the board of directors of
the Company shall adopt resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to provide that, with respect to the Compuware Corporation Amended
and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"): (i) all Offers and
Purchase Periods (each as defined in the ESPP), shall be suspended upon the
completion of the Purchase Period ending August 31, 2014 (the "Final ESPP
Offering") until terminated pursuant to clause (iii) below or until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , (ii) each
ESPP participant's accumulated contributions under the ESPP shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP as of the end of the Final ESPP Offering; and (iii) the ESPP shall be
terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. All shares of Company
Common Stock purchased in the Final ESPP Offering shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

  

(f) _Freeze and Termination of International Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As
soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the board of
directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions or take such other actions as
may be required to provide that, with respect to the Compuware Corporation
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "IESPP"): (i) all Offers and
Purchase Periods (each as defined in the IESPP), shall be suspended upon the
completion of the Purchase Period ending August 31, 2014 (the "Final IESPP
Offering") until terminated pursuant to clause (iii) below or until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_ , (ii) each
IESPP participant's accumulated contributions under the IESPP shall be used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the

Common Stock purchased in the Final IESPP Offering shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  

    

Section 3.5 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the
Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_ , for each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. Payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ , and, if applicable, any unclaimed dividends declared
prior to the Effective Time upon the surrender of Certificates, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by

individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Complete
and correct copies of the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws, as
currently in effect, are included in the Company SEC Documents and the Company
is not in violation of any provision of such documents. _Section 4.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of each
Subsidiary of the Company and its place and form of organization.

(a) _Section 4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of each material Company Benefit Plan
(which list may reference a form of such Company Benefit Plan). For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Company Benefit Plan" shall mean (i) any
"employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
whether or not subject to ERISA) that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
sponsors, participates in, is a party or contributes to, or otherwise has or
could reasonably be expected to have any liability or obligation; and (ii)
each other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, including any stock
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation right or other stock or stock-based
incentive, cash bonus or incentive compensation, retirement or deferred
compensation, profit-sharing, unemployment or severance compensation, or
employment or consulting or independent contractor, agreement, plan, policy,
program or arrangement for any current or former employee or director of, or
other service provider to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that does not
constitute an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA),
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, participates in, is a
party or contributes to, or with respect to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has or could reasonably be expected to have any liability.

  

    

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of each
material Company Benefit Plan and all amendments thereto and a true and
complete copy of the following items with respect thereto (in each case, only
if applicable): (i) each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary
plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the most
recently filed annual report on IRS Form 5500 and (iv) the most recently
received IRS determination letter or IRS opinion letter.

  

  

(c) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the
Company Benefit Plans has been established, maintained, operated, administered
and funded in accordance with its terms and in compliance with applicable Laws
and Contracts. No Company Benefit Plan has any unfunded liabilities that would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
any Company Benefit Plan, any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction in connection with which
the Company, any Subsidiary, any Company Benefit Plan, any such trust, or any
trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Company
Benefit Plan or any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

  

  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
with respect to each such Company Benefit Plan as to its qualified status
under the Code, or with respect to a prototype Company Benefit Plan, the
prototype sponsor has received a favorable IRS opinion letter, or the Company
Benefit Plan or prototype sponsor has remaining a period of time under
applicable Code regulations or pronouncements of the IRS in which to apply for
such a letter and make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination or opinion as to the qualified status of each such Company
Benefit Plan, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred since
the most recent determination or opinion letter or application therefor
relating to any such Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the qualification of such Company Benefit Plan. Each Company
Benefit Plan maintained for employees outside of the United States that is
intended to receive favorable Tax treatment under applicable Tax Laws has been
qualified, registered or similarly determined (as applicable) to satisfy the
requirements of such Tax Laws, except as would not give rise to material
liability.

  

  

  

(f) No liability or obligation under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Sections 412 or 430 of the Code has been incurred by the Company or any Person
that is a member of a "controlled group of corporations" with, or is under
"common control" with, or is a member of the same "affiliated service group"
with the Company, in each case, as defined in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)
of the Code (each, an "ERISA Affiliate") within the six (6) year period
preceding the Effective Time that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of incurring any such liability. No Company Benefit Plan maintained
for employees outside of the United States is a defined benefit or similar
type of plan or arrangement, other than those plans or arrangements that are
required to be maintained pursuant to applicable Law.

  

    

(g) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no
(i) claims, actions, suits, audits, disputes or claims (other than routine
claims for benefits) pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting any Company Benefit Plan, by any Governmental Authority,
employee, beneficiary, or participant covered under such Company Benefit Plan,
as applicable, or otherwise involving such Company Benefit Plan.

  

  

  

(h) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Merger will (i) entitle any current or former director, employee,
consultant or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to any material payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, (ii)
materially increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation or
other obligation payable or required to be provided to any such director,
employee, consultant or independent contractor, or any Company Benefit Plan,
or (iii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of amounts due any such
director, employee, consultant or independent contractor or accelerate the
time of any funding (whether to a trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits in respect of any of the Company Benefit Plans, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.

  

  

  

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has any material obligations for post-
termination health or life insurance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
(other than for continuation coverage required to be provided pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code for which the covered individual pays the full cost
of coverage).

  

  

(j) The Company and its Subsidiaries have no liabilities or other obligations
with respect to the compensation (including base salary, bonus and other
incentive compensation (whether cash, equity or otherwise)) and benefits
payable in respect of the employees, consultants and independent contractors
of Covisint and its Subsidiaries with respect to such employees', consultants'
and independent contractors' employment with, or provision of services to,

Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, during the three (3) years prior to

without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be
expected to, result in a requirement that any material proprietary source code
of any of the products or offerings of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
be disclosed or delivered to any third party by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any person acting on their behalf. To the Knowledge of the
Company, as of the date hereof, there has been no unauthorized theft or

Subsidiaries maintain commercially reasonable security, disaster recovery and
business continuity plans, procedures and facilities, act in material
compliance therewith, and have taken commercially reasonable steps to test
such plans and procedures on a periodic basis, and such plans and procedures
have been proven effective upon such testing in all material respects.

Sub is a corporation, partnership or other entity duly organized, validly
existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite
company power and authority to conduct its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing or to have such
power and authority would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly registered, qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such registration, qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
Parent Organizational Documents, as currently in effect, and neither Parent
nor Acquisition Sub is in violation of any provision of such documents.

  

  

Section 5.2 _Authority Relative to Agreement_.

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub
and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the other party hereto and that this Agreement is a valid, legal and binding
obligation of the other party hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent and

performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
Proceeding therefor may be brought.

  

    

(b) The board of directors or similar governing body of each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub has, by unanimous resolutions duly adopted by the requisite
vote of the directors or similar governing members, (i) adopted and approved
this Agreement and the other agreements and transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the Merger, and (ii) determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective shareholders or

transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Acquisition Sub nor the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the

assuming that the Consents, registrations, declarations, filings and notices
referred to in _Section 5.3_ have been obtained or made, any applicable
waiting periods referred to therein have expired and any condition precedent
to any such Consent has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property or
asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected or (iii)
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to any right of termination,
acceleration or cancellation or change of any rights or obligation or the loss
of any benefit to which Parent or Acquisition Sub is entitled under any
provision of any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound, or
(iv) result in the creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted Lien or any
Lien created in connection with the Financing, upon any of the material
property or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), any such conflict, violation, breach,
default, termination, acceleration, cancellation or Lien that would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(d) No vote of, or consent by, the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Parent is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance by Parent of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent, applicable Law (including any shareholder
approval provisions under the rules of any applicable securities exchange) or
any Governmental Authority.

  

    

Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. No Consent of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental

notifications under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws and (vi) such
additional Consents, registrations, declarations, filings or notices the
failure of which to be obtained or made would not (x) have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) impair in any material
respect the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations
hereunder to prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, settlement,
ruling or Order of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority outstanding
against Parent or Acquisition Sub that would (x) have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) impair in any material
respect the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations
hereunder or prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplate hereby on a timely basis.

  

  

Section 5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries that would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any judgment of any Governmental Authority outstanding against,
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Authority
involving, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.5 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Except for the Voting Agreements,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates has entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), or
authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract, arrangement or
understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant to which any
shareholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any shareholder of the Company (i) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or
the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

  

  

Section 5.6 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
date it is first mailed to the shareholders of the Company and at the time of
the Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

  

    

Section 5.7 _Financing_.

  

  

  

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(1) the executed commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes
and amendments thereto) from Jefferies Finance LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank
AG New York Branch (the "Commitment Parties") together with any related fee
letters (which copies of the fee letters may be redacted so long as no
redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the conditionality,
availability or termination of the Debt Financing), engagement letters,
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements
(collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letters"), pursuant to which, and subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, the Commitment Parties have committed to
lend the amounts set forth therein to Acquisition Sub or another wholly owned
Affiliate as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters for the purpose of
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with any
substitute debt financing pursuant to _Section 6.10(c)_ , the "Debt
Financing"), and (2) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the
date hereof (the "Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letters, the "Financing Commitments") from Thoma Bravo Fund XI,
L.P. (the "Guarantor") pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed to
invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the amounts set forth
therein (the "Equity Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to
provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof.

  

  

  

(b) As of the date hereof, the Financing Commitments are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect, except as permitted by this
Agreement. Each of the Financing Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or other similar
applicable Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
general equitable principles. Except as set forth in the Financing
Commitments, there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to the Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under
any term, or a failure of any condition, of the Financing Commitments or
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be
unavailable. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has
reason to believe that it could reasonably be expected to be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitments required
to be satisfied by it. Parent and/or Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitments to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the
Financing when funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments are
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient
for the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Acquisition Sub's obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.3_ , and the
payment of all associated costs and Expenses of the Merger (including any
repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company required in connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent
related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the
Financing Commitments.

  

    

Section 5.8 _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and Acquisition Sub have delivered to the Company the Guaranty of the
Guarantor, dated as of the date hereof. The Guaranty is in full force and
effect and is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable
against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of
equity) and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such
Guaranty.

  

  

Section 5.9 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date hereof, the
authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000 shares, no par
value per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition Sub is, and at the
Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any
business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time
will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.10 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have
not been registered under the Securities Act or any Blue Sky Laws and cannot
be sold unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act, any
applicable Blue Sky Laws or pursuant to an exemption from any such
registration.

  

  

Section 5.11 _Brokers_. No broker, finder, investment banker, consultant or
intermediary is entitled to any investment banking, brokerage, finder's or
similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or

Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

  

    

Section 5.12 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Guarantor is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is
Solvent as of the date hereof and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration and any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ , the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and Expenses, and assuming (i)
any estimates, projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been prepared by them in good faith based upon assumptions that were, and
continue to be, reasonable and (ii) the representations and warranties in
_Article IV_ are true and correct in all respects, be Solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.12_ , the
term "Solvent" means, with respect to a particular date, that on such date,

and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
and, after the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, after the
Merger, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries has
sufficient capital and liquidity with which to conduct its business. For
purposes of this _Section 5.12_ , "debt" means any liability on a claim, and
"claim" means any (a) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (b) any
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives
rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.

  

  

Section 5.13 _Share Ownership_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub or their
respective controlled Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or
of record, including pursuant to a derivatives contract), or has owned at any
time during the two (2) years preceding the date hereof, any Company Common
Stock and none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective controlled
Affiliates holds any rights to acquire any Company Common Stock except
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.14 _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement and the Voting
Agreements, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or
Acquisition Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the Company's management or the board of directors, on the other hand,
relating in any way to the Company (including relating to compensation and
retention of the Company's management), transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the operations of the Company after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 5.15 _No Negotiations_. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
Parent, Acquisition Sub or their Affiliates are actively involved in
substantive negotiations with respect to the acquisition of any business that
would reasonably be deemed competitive with the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

  

    

Section 5.16 _Acknowledgment of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that, as of the
date hereof, they and their Representatives (a) have received full access to
(i) such books and records, facilities, properties, premises, equipment,
contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries which they and
their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to review and
(ii) the electronic and physical data rooms in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby and (b) have had full opportunity to meet with the
management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to discuss the business and
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent and Acquisition Sub each
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and any certificate delivered hereunder,
(a) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes, or has made, any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with the Merger and Parent and Acquisition Sub are not relying on
any representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth in
_Article IV_ , (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to itself or its
business or otherwise in connection with the Merger, and if made, such
representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Acquisition
Sub as having been authorized by such entity and (c) any estimate, projection,
prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or any other
materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Acquisition Sub or
any of their Representatives, including any materials or information made
available in the electronic and physical data rooms in connection with the
transaction, via confidential information memorandum, in connection with
presentations by the Company's management or otherwise, are not and shall not
be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless and to the
extent any such materials or information is the subject of any express
representation or warranty set forth in _Article IV_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent review
and analysis of the businesses, assets, condition, operations and prospects of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and
the Financing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has relied on the results of
its own independent review and analysis and the covenants, representations and
warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will limit any remedy Parent may have for
fraud committed by the Company or any Representative of the Company (whether
or not such fraud relates to a representation made in a written agreement
between the parties).

Section 6.2 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders ' Meeting_ _;
Spin-Off_.

  

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (with the Company using
reasonable best efforts to do so within twenty (20) calendar days following
the date of this Agreement), (i) the Company shall prepare the Proxy
Statement, (ii) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall furnish to the Company all
information concerning themselves and their Affiliates that is required to be
included in the Proxy Statement and shall promptly provide such other
assistance in the preparation of the Proxy Statement as may be reasonably
requested by the Company from time to time, and (iii) subject to the receipt
from Parent and Acquisition Sub of the information described in clause (ii)
above, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent and
Acquisition Sub promptly with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC,
on the other hand. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts (with the
assistance of, and after consultation with, Parent as provided by this
_Section 6.2_ _(a)_ ) to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement, including filing any amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement as may be required. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response (and the Company shall give due consideration to
including any such comments in the Proxy Statement (or any supplement or
amendment thereto) or response letter), except, in each case, to the extent
prohibited by Law.

  

  

  

(b) The Company shall file the definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's
shareholders as of the record date established for the Shareholders' Meeting
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within five (5) Business Days)
after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on
the Proxy Statement (the "SEC Clearance Date"); _provided_ that if the SEC has
failed to affirmatively notify the Company within ten (10) calendar days after
the initial filing of the Proxy Statement with the SEC that it will or will
not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, then such date shall be the "SEC
Clearance Date." If, at any time prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or
Parent or Acquisition Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Company's shareholders.

  

    

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the SEC Clearance
Date (and in any event within forty (40) calendar days following the SEC
Clearance Date), (i) establish a record date for and give notice of a meeting
of its shareholders, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of this
Agreement and holding the Company Shareholder Advisory Vote (the
"Shareholders' Meeting") and (ii) duly call, convene and hold the
Shareholders' Meeting; _provided_ that the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Shareholders' Meeting only (i) with the written consent of Parent and
Acquisition Sub (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) after consultation with
Parent, to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith is necessary under
applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Company's shareholders prior to the
Shareholders' Meeting or (iv) to allow additional solicitation of votes in
order to obtain the Requisite Shareholder Approval. Once the Company has
established the record date for the Shareholders' Meeting, the Company shall
not change such record date or establish a different record date without the
prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law.
In the event that the date of the Shareholders' Meeting as originally called
is for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company
agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing, it shall
implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that
the Company does not establish a new record date for the Shareholders'
Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by
applicable Law. Unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 6.5_ , the Company shall, through the board of directors
of the Company, but subject to the right of the board of directors of the
Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5_ ,
provide the Company Recommendation and shall include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and, unless there has been an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.5_ , the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the Requisite
Shareholder Approval. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall vote all shares of
Company Common Stock held by them in favor of the approval of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is
validly terminated pursuant to, and in accordance, with _Article VIII_ , this
Agreement shall be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock for the
purpose of obtaining the Requisite Shareholder Approval. The Company shall,
upon the reasonable request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
advise Parent on a daily basis on each of the last ten (10) Business Days
prior to the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of
the proxies received by the Company with respect to the Requisite Shareholder
Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), approval of this Agreement,
holding the Company Shareholder Advisory Vote and adjournment shall be the
only matters (other than procedure matters) which the Company shall propose to
be acted on by the holders of Company Common Stock at the Shareholders'
Meeting. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not condition its
submission of this Agreement or the Merger to the shareholders of the Company
on any basis other than receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Approval.

  

    

(d) Unless Parent otherwise consents in writing, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event within sixty (60) calendar days
following the date of this Agreement), the Company shall (i) execute the Spin-
Off Agreements (each of which shall be subject to the prior approval of
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (ii) enter into an amended and restated tax sharing agreement with
Covisint containing such terms and conditions as Parent shall reasonably
request and approve (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), (iii) consummate the Spin-Off in accordance with the
terms of the Spin-Off Agreements and (iv) complete the Spin-Off; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Company shall not be required to complete the Spin-Off if
definitive documentation for a Covisint Sale has been entered into prior to
the expiration of such sixty (60) day period. Any definitive documentation
with respect to a Covisint Sale that (x) is not in the form of a customary
public company merger agreement or (y) would subject Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to any indemnification, non-compete, non-solicit or expense
reimbursement obligation or other material liability or obligation following
the consummation of a Covisint Sale, in each case, shall be subject to the
prior written approval of Parent (which Parent may grant or withhold in its
sole discretion). If definitive documentation with respect to a Covisint Sale
is entered into prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company agree to promptly thereafter (A) develop and
implement an appropriate mechanism and/or structure in order to transfer or
distribute the net cash proceeds received by the Company in such Covisint Sale
(after deducting (x) the Spin-Off Taxes relating to such Covisint Sale and (y)
the Covisint Sale Retention Amount) to the Company's shareholders, holders of
Company Stock Units and holders of Company Options and (B) make such
amendments to this Agreement as are necessary to reflect such mechanism and/or
structure (provided that the parties agree that such amendment shall include a
provision providing for a holdback from the Merger Consideration otherwise
payable at the Effective Time in an amount equal to the parties' good faith
estimate of the Spin-Off Taxes that would be payable in the event a Covisint
Sale does not close and the Spin-Off subsequently occurs); _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, that no proceeds shall be transferred or distributed
to the Company's shareholders prior to the closing of the Covisint Sale and
the receipt by the Company of such consideration. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall be permitted to make an
election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election
under state, local or foreign tax law) in connection with the Covisint Sale.

  

  

  

(e) In connection with the consummation of the Spin-Off, the Board of
Directors of the Company will be permitted to (i) reduce the exercise price
per share of each outstanding Company Option; _provided_ , that all such
reductions in the aggregate will not exceed $11,000,000 and (ii) treat
outstanding Company Stock Units as outstanding shares of Common Stock for
purposes of participating in the Spin-Off.

  

    

  

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.5_ ), the parties hereto will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if
any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the obtaining of all other
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from Third Parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Merger Litigation"), including the Merger,
performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed
or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto shall promptly (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date that this Agreement is executed) make and not withdraw its
respective filings under the HSR Act, and make as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof any other applications and filings as
reasonably determined by Company and Parent under applicable Antitrust Laws
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any Third Party consents, approvals
or waivers pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)(ii)_ above shall not be considered a
condition to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
Merger. The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
Merger Litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement with respect to
such Merger Litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments
into account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed to with respect to the
Company without Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or
submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including (i) promptly informing the other party of
such inquiry, (ii) consulting in advance, and considering in good faith the
other party's views, before making any presentations or submissions to a
Governmental Authority, (iii) giving the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any substantive meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Authority, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, and (iv) supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any
Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.

  

    

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the
representatives, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors ("Representatives") of Parent and the
Financing Sources reasonable access, in a manner not disruptive in any
material respect to the operations of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to the properties,
Contracts, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, during
such period, shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to such Representatives (A) all information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as may reasonably
be requested and (B) to the extent available, for the period beginning after
the date of this Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, as soon as
practicable after the end of each month, and in any event within thirty (30)
days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial statements of
the Company, including statements of financial condition, results of
operations and statements of cash flow; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to Parent or Acquisition Sub if such disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) violate applicable Law or the
provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or (ii) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege;
_provided_ that, with respect to the foregoing clause (i), the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain any Third Party's
consent to the disclosure of such information and implement appropriate
procedures to enable the disclosure of such information; _provided_ _further_
, that nothing herein shall authorize Parent or its Representatives to
undertake any environmental testing involving sampling of soil, groundwater,
or similar invasive techniques at any of the properties owned, operated or
leased by the Company or its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event that the Company does not disclose information in reliance on clause
(i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence, it shall provide notice to Parent that
it is withholding such information and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in
a way that would not waive such privilege or violate such Law or agreement. No
investigation or access permitted pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
hereunder. Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (which transactions, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall include the Financing). The Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
with respect to information furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries and the
Company's officers, employees and other Representatives hereunder.

  

  

Section 6.5 _Non-Solicitation; Competing Proposals_.

  

  

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms the
Company shall, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause
each of its directors, officers, Representatives and Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or
discussions or negotiations with, any Third Party relating to any Competing
Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be
expected to facilitate, encourage or lead to a Competing Proposal. As promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date hereof (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days), the Company shall request in writing that each Third
Party that has previously executed a confidentiality or similar agreement in
connection with its consideration of a Competing Proposal promptly return to
the Company or destroy any non-public information previously furnished or made
available to such Third Party or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of
the Company or its Representatives in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement in place with such Third Party.

  

    

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within
thirty-six (36) hours of receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives of any Competing Proposal or any
inquiry or request relating to a Competing Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information of the Company or its Subsidiaries, deliver to Parent a
written notice setting forth: (A) the identity of the Third Party making such
Competing Proposal, inquiry or request and (B) the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements
relating thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the
status and any material amendment or modification of any such Competing
Proposal, inquiry or request on a prompt basis, and in any event within
thirty-six (36) hours thereof.

  

  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.5_ , from and after the
date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall
not, and the Company shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its directors, officers, Representatives and Subsidiaries not to, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the making of any Competing Proposal,
including any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Competing Proposal, (ii) engage in negotiations or substantive discussions
with (it being understood that the Company may inform Persons of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_ ), or furnish any material
nonpublic information to, any Person relating to a Competing Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing
Proposal, (iii) grant access to the properties, books, records or personnel of
the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person who the Company has reason to
believe is considering making, or has made, a Competing Proposal, (iv) grant
any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality
agreement, _provided_ that the Company shall not be required to enforce, and
shall be permitted to waive, any provision that prohibits or purports to
prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the board of directors of the
Company (directly or indirectly through the Company's Representatives), (v)
approve, endorse, recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to a Competing Proposal or any proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal (an
"Acquisition Agreement"), or that contradicts this Agreement or requires the
Company to abandon this Agreement or (vi) resolve, propose or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

  

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date that the Requisite
Shareholder Approval is obtained at the Shareholders' Meeting, in the event
that the Company receives a Competing Proposal from any Person, (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms
and conditions thereof and (ii) the Company and its board of directors and its
Representatives may engage in negotiations or substantive discussions with, or
furnish any information and other access to, any Person making such Competing
Proposal and its Representatives or potential sources of financing if the
Company's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel) that (A) such Competing Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take any of the foregoing actions
would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , _that_ , (x)
prior to furnishing any material nonpublic information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries, the Company receives from such Person, to the extent
such Person is not already subject to a confidentiality agreement with the
Company, an executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality
terms that are not materially less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed
that such confidentiality agreement need not restrict the making of Competing
Proposals (and related communications) to the Company or the Company's board
of directors) and (y) any such material nonpublic information so furnished in
writing shall be promptly made available to Parent to the extent it was not
previously made available to Parent or its Representatives.

  

    

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.5(e)_ , the board of
directors of the Company shall not (i) (A) withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly or otherwise to withdraw, withhold, qualify or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or fail to make, the
Company Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to adopt, approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal, (C) fail to publicly
recommend against any Competing Proposal or fail to publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation, in each case within five (5) Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing (D) fail to recommend against any Competing
Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 within ten (10)
Business Days after the commencement of such Competing Proposal, or (E) fail
to include the recommendation of the Company's board of directors in favor of
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger in the Proxy Statement
(any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an "Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to execute,
approve or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
definitive merger or similar agreement with respect to any Competing Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.5(d)_ ).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior
to receipt of the Requisite Shareholder Approval, if the Company has received
a Competing Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and the Company
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of
directors of the Company may (x) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y)
authorize, adopt or approve such Superior Proposal and cause or permit the
Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal concurrently with the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and the payment of the Termination Fee, in each case only
if (A) the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to violate the directors' fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, (ii) the board of
directors of the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives has materially breached this _Section 6.5_
(other than any inadvertent breaches thereof not intended to result in a
Competing Proposal); _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) no Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.5(e)_ and _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ may be effected, in
each case until after the fourth (4th) Business Day (the "Notice Period")
following Parent's receipt of a written notice from the Company advising
Parent that the Company has received a Competing Proposal that is not
withdrawn and that the board of directors of the Company has concluded in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the board of directors of the Company has
resolved to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 6.5(e)_ and _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ (a "Notice of
Superior Proposal") and specifying the reasons therefor, including, the terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including copies of all relevant
documents relating to such Superior Proposal) and the identity of the party
making the Superior Proposal. During the Notice Period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to (1) negotiate with Parent and its
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
the Competing Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (2)
permit Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the board of
directors of the Company regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent Parent desires to make such presentation). Any
material amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
_Section 6.5(e)_ , including the Notice Period. In determining whether a
Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of
the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement timely proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise.

  

    

(f) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within thirty-six (36) hours,
advise Parent of any Competing Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Competing Proposal (including, if applicable, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and the identity
of the Person making any such Competing Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status and material
details (including any material change to the terms thereof) of any such
Competing Proposal and any discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof.

  

  

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the Company or the board of
directors of the Company from taking or disclosing a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act, or otherwise making disclosure
to comply with applicable Law with regard to a Competing Proposal (it being
agreed that a "stop, look and listen" communication by the board of directors
to the Company's shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
or a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Company's receipt of a Competing Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change or give rise to a Parent termination right pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_ ).

  

  

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written or oral proposal or
offer made by any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any Affiliate
thereof) or group of Persons as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
Act to purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, (i) beneficial ownership (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of twenty percent (20%) or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock,
tender offer (including a self-tender offer), exchange offer, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction, (ii) any one or more assets or businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that constitute twenty percent (20%) or
more of the revenues, earnings or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole or (iii) any other transaction the consummation of which
would reasonably be expected to interfere with or prevent the Merger.

  

    

(ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Proposal (with all percentages
in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to seventy five percent
(75%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its legal counsel
and financial advisors) and considering such factors as the board of directors
of the Company considers to be appropriate (including, among other things, if
appropriate, financing contingencies, regulatory approvals, shareholder
litigation, identity of the Third Party making the Competing Proposal
(including whether shareholder approval of such Third Party is required),
breakup fee and expenses reimbursement provisions and other events or
circumstances beyond the control of the Company), are more favorable to the
Company's shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent
to the Company in writing in response to such Competing Proposal under the
provisions of _Section 6.5(e)_ ).

  

  

Section 6.6 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby), now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers and employees, if any ("DandO Indemnified Parties"), as the
case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective organizational documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement
or in any Contract shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time. For a period of
six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), to the fullest extent
required by the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries as
in effect on the date of this Agreement and as would be permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such
claim. Parent shall cause the articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' organizational documents as of the date hereof, which
provisions thereafter shall not, for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the DandO Indemnified Parties.

  

    

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six (6) year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the DandO
Indemnified Parties, or any other Person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section 6.6_ , as applicable, than the existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary insurance maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date hereof, covering claims
arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ ,
that the premium for such insurance for the entire six (6) year term shall not
exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently
paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, on an
annualized basis). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if such six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy is not available for purchase by
the Company (or cannot be purchased in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement), the Surviving Corporation shall continue the current directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance on a yearly basis
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time ( _provided_ , that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of one hundred fifty
percent (150%) of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, for such coverage, but in such case
shall purchase as much of such coverage as possible for such amount).

  

  

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of the Company's
Subsidiaries or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with
or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
company or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successor and assign of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any such
Subsidiary assumes the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  

  

(d) The DandO Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit of each DandO Indemnified Party
and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay all reasonable and documented expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party in
enforcing its indemnity and other rights under this _Section 6.6_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely (or any earlier
period actually specified in this _Section 6.6_ ) and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, and shall be enforceable by the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their successors, heirs or representatives.

  

    

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Spin-Off, the Spin-Off Agreements or
the transactions contemplated thereby, or from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or
the Spin-Off or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, (b) any Proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the Spin-Off, the Spin-Off Agreements or
the transactions contemplated thereby and (c) any breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result
in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ , as
applicable, if continuing on the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise contemplated by
_Section 6.5_ , the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and none of the parties or their Affiliates shall issue any such press
release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the other parties'
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be
required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange rule or any listing
agreement of any party hereto (in which case the disclosing party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party prior to such
disclosure) or is consistent with prior communications previously consented to
by Parent. In addition, the Company may, without Parent or Acquisition Sub's
consent, communicate to its employees, customers, suppliers and consultants
provided that such communication is consistent with prior communications of
the Company or any communications plan previously agreed to by Parent and the
Company in which case such communications may be made consistent with such
plan.

  

  

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

  

  

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one
(1)-year anniversary thereof (the "Benefit Period"), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) provide to each employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who remains
an employee of the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates immediately
after the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees") with, during their
period of employment with the Surviving Corporation or one of its Affiliates
in the Benefit Period, an annual rate of base salary or wages, as applicable,
and the cash incentive compensation target amount opportunity that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the annual rate of base salary or wages, as
applicable, and the incentive compensation (cash and equity) target amount
opportunity provided to each such employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing
Employees who remain employees of the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Affiliates with employee benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation or
benefits and employee benefits that are frozen, discontinued or, as of the
Effective Time, being frozen or discontinued) that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to the employee benefits (excluding any equity-based
compensation or benefits and employee benefits that are frozen, discontinued
or, as of the Effective Time, being frozen or discontinued) provided to such
employees by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 4.12(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. In addition, Parent shall continue the
short-term and long-term component (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any
equity component) of the incentive plans identified on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter in respect of the 2015 fiscal year as in effect on
the date hereof (the "2015 Incentive Plans") and shall make cash payments
thereunder, based upon the extent of achievement of the applicable performance
metrics set forth therein, to each Continuing Employee at the time set forth
therein (the "2015 Bonuses"). In the event any Continuing Employee is
terminated by the Company for any reason other than for cause, fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence prior to the payment of the 2015 Bonuses,
Parent shall pay such Continuing Employee an amount equal to his or her 2015
Bonus, prorated to reflect the number of days such Continuing Employee was
employed during the 2015 fiscal year, and shall pay the prorated 2015 Bonus at
the same time 2015 Bonuses are paid to other Continuing Employees.

  

    

  

(b) Parent agrees that the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Surviving
Corporation's employee benefit plans established following the Closing Date
(if any) and any other employee benefit plans covering the Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time (collectively, the "Post-Closing
Plans"), to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee (to the extent
such service was recognized by the Company under the analogous Company Benefit
Plan for the same purpose) for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
determination of the level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual purposes
under a defined benefit pension plan) under the Post-Closing Plans, to the
extent such recognition does not result in the duplication of any benefits.

  

  

(c) For the calendar year including the Effective Time, the Continuing
Employees shall be credited with amounts to satisfy any deductible, co-
payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar requirements under the Post-Closing
Plans that provide medical, dental and other welfare benefits (collectively,
the "Post-Closing Welfare Plans") to the extent of amounts that were
previously credited for such Continuing Employee for the same purposes under
comparable Company Benefit Plans that provide medical, dental and other
welfare benefits immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) As of the Effective Time, any waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions and requirements to show evidence of good health contained in any
Post-Closing Welfare Plans that is a group health plan shall be waived with
respect to the Continuing Employees (except to the extent any such waiting
period, pre-existing condition exclusion, or requirement of show evidence of
good health was already in effect with respect to such employees and had not
been satisfied under the applicable Company Benefit Plan in which the
participant participated or was otherwise eligible to participate in
immediately prior to the Effective Time).

  

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance payments and benefits in
accordance with the Company's past practice to each Continuing Employee whose
employment is terminated, on or before the first (1st) anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, under circumstances that would otherwise
give rise to rights to severance payments.

  

    

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with their terms (including any right to
amend or terminate), all Company Benefit Plans set forth in _Section 4.12(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of
all works council, labor or collective bargaining agreements by which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are bound that are in effect as of the Effective
Time, each as set forth in _Section 4.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_ to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Post-Closing
Plan, or any other employee benefit plans of the Company or Parent or as a
guarantee of employment for any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and (ii) confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

  

  

  

Section 6.10 _Financing_.

  

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to, take or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds
of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, including using (and causing its Affiliates to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to: (i) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments, which agreements shall be in effect no later than the Closing,
(ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, all conditions
applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective Representatives in
the Debt Commitment Letters (or definitive agreements entered into with
respect to the Debt Commitment Letters), (iii) comply with any "flex"
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in the event such "flex"
provisions are exercised in accordance with the terms thereof and (iv) in the
event all conditions to the Financing have been satisfied or waived (other
than, with respect to the Debt Financing, the availability of the Equity
Financing) enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent available in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources that
materially impedes or delays (or could reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay) the Closing.

  

  

  

(b) Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision
under the Financing Commitments without the prior written consent of the
Company if such amendments, modifications or waivers would reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing), other than such
reduction in an amount which would not cause the remaining amount of the
Financing to be insufficient to consummate the Transactions (including the
payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 3.3_ and all associated costs and Expenses of the Merger), impose new
or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions under the Financing Commitments that could be reasonably likely to
(i) prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Parent to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt
Financing Commitment solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof. Parent shall not release or consent
to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letters, except for (i) assignments and replacements of an individual lender
under the terms of, and only in connection with, the syndication of the
Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters or (ii) replacements of the
Debt Commitment Letters with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
_Section 6.10(c)_.

  

    

(c) In the event that any portion of the Financing (x) becomes unavailable or
(y) could reasonably be expected to become unavailable in the manner or from
the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments, (i) Parent shall
promptly notify the Company and (ii) in the case of subclause (x), Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into
financing commitments (if applicable) and definitive agreements with respect
to, alternative financing from alternative financial institutions in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon
terms and conditions not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Acquisition Sub than those in the Financing Commitments, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event (and, in any
event, no later than the expiration of the Marketing Period). In the event
Parent obtains financing commitments with respect to alternative financing,
(i) the terms "Debt Commitment Letters" and "Financing Commitment Letters" as
used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are
not so superseded at the time in question and the alternative financing
commitments to the extent then in effect, and (ii) the term "Debt Financing"
as used herein shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing clause (i). The
definitive agreements entered into pursuant to this _Section 6.10(c)_ or
_Section 6.10(a)_ _(i)_ are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as
the "Financing Agreements."

  

  

  

(d) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the obtaining of the Financing or any alternative financing, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or any
alternative financing, is a condition to the Closing.

  

  

  

(e) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not incur any
liability prior to the Effective Time to any Person under any financing that
Parent and Acquisition Sub may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.10_ or _Section 6.11_ and, that Parent and Acquisition Sub shall,
on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with the Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than with respect to any material misstatement or
omission in information provided hereunder by any of the foregoing Persons).

  

    

(f) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of each amendment, waiver or other modification of the Financing Commitments
and of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing commitment or
agreement promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice
of any material breach or threatened material breach by any party of any of
the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment, the Financing
Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement of which Parent or
Acquisition Sub becomes aware or any termination or threatened termination
thereof of which Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes aware, (iii) give the
Company prompt notice of each material dispute or disagreement between or
among the parties to the Financing Commitments and (iv) otherwise keep the
Company reasonably and promptly informed of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing (or any alternative financing), including by providing
the Company, upon request, with drafts of the definitive agreements or
offering memoranda relating to the Financing a reasonable period of time prior
to their execution or use (subject to any confidentiality limitations or
applicable Law, and subject to customary confidentiality undertakings).

  

    

Section 6.11 _Financing Cooperation_. Subject to _Section 6.10(a)_ , prior to
the Closing, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at
Parent's sole expense, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in connection
with the closing of the Financing ( _provided_ , that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the Company shall include,
at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) furnishing, or causing to be
furnished to, Parent and its Financing Sources such customary financial and
other information as Parent shall reasonably request in order to consummate
the Debt Financing, including all financial statements and financial data of
the type necessary for the preparation of a confidential information memoranda
customary for transactions of the type contemplated by the Debt Financing and
other customary and reasonably available marketing materials, including (1)
audited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income and cash

the Company for each fiscal quarter of the Company (other than the fourth
fiscal quarter) ended after the close of its most recent fiscal year and at
least 45 days prior to the Closing Date (all such information to be provided
under this clause (i), collectively, the "Required Information," _provided_

best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its preparation of such materials),
(ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations,
due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and road shows, in each case, upon
reasonable advance notice and at mutually agreed times, (iii) providing
reasonable assistance to Parent and its Financing Sources in its preparation
of rating agency presentations, customary bank information memoranda, offering

Effective Time), (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
syndication efforts benefit from existing lending and investment banking

Parent or the Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing and
required under applicable "know your customer" sanctions and anti-money-
laundering rules and regulations. Any use of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing shall require the
Company's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the actions contemplated in the
foregoing clauses do not (A) involve any binding commitment by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries which commitment is not conditioned on the Closing and
does not terminate without liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
upon the termination of this Agreement, (B) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to provide any information the disclosure of which is prohibited
or restricted under applicable Law or is legally privileged; _provided_ that
the Company shall notify Parent and the Financing Sources if any such

its Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate its
organizational documents, any Laws or result in a violation or breach of, or
default under, any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party; _provided_ that the Company shall notify Parent and the Financing
Sources if any such action is not being taken on such basis, or (D) require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any Financing

Financing as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings. Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for
any expenses and costs incurred in connection with the Company's or its
Affiliates' or Representatives' obligations under this _Section 6.11_.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or enter into any definitive agreement (other than executing
the authorization letters referred to in this _Section 6.11_ _(iii)_ above) or
incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Financing (or

prior to the Effective Time that are not promptly reimbursed by Parent as set
forth in this _Section 6.11_ , (ii) no officer or Representative of the

certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to this _Section
6.11_ to the extent any such action would reasonably be expected to result in
personal liability to such officer or Representative and (iii) the board of
directors of the Company shall not be required to approve any financing or
agreements related thereto prior to the Effective Time.

  

    

Section 6.12 _Repayment of Indebtedness_. In connection with and conditioned
upon the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause an Affiliate) provide
and make available to the Company in immediately available funds in an amount
equal to the amount necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to repay
and discharge in full all amounts outstanding or otherwise due and owing
pursuant to the terms of the financing arrangements set forth on _Section
6.12_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Company Debt"), including accrued
interest thereon and all fees and other obligations (including penalties or
other charges or amounts that become payable thereunder as a result of the
prepayment thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated at
the Closing or that may become due and payable at the Effective Time) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder (collectively, the "Debt Payoff
Amount"). Subject to Parent's compliance with the previous sentence, the
Company shall pay the Debt Payoff Amount to the counterparties under the
Company Debt as promptly as practicable following the date the Company
receives such Debt Payoff Amount.

  

  

Section 6.13 _Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Acquisition Sub shall not
conduct any business, or incur or guarantee any indebtedness or make any
investments, other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 6.14 _No Control of the Company 's Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries' operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' operations.

  

  

Section 6.15 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take such further actions, if any, as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including any derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.16 _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use,
transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer,
recording, registration and other fees, and any similar taxes which become
payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that are required to be filed before the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.17 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each
other in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and terminate registration under the Exchange
Act, provided that such delisting and termination shall not be effective until
or after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.18 _WARN Act Compliance_. At the Closing, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent a true and correct list, by date
and location, of all employees terminated by the Company and its Subsidiaries
(other than for cause) in the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the
Closing Date. For a period of ninety (90) days immediately following the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall take no action or make any
omission that would give rise to notice obligations under the WARN Act without
complying in all material respects with the requirements of the WARN Act.

  

    

Section 6.19 _Payoff Letters_. The Company shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable and at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, deliver
to Parent payoff letters with respect to all Company Debt outstanding as of
the Closing and releases of all Liens securing such Company Debt, conditioned
only on the payment of the amounts described in such payoff letters.

  

  

Section 6.20 _Tax Matters_.

  

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business
Days) following the date of the Spin-Off, the Company shall prepare in good
faith and deliver to Parent the Company's calculation of the Spin-Off Taxes as
of such date (the "Company's Tax Calculations"). The Company shall permit
Parent and its Representatives at all reasonable times and upon reasonable
notice to review the Company's working papers relating to the Company's Tax
Calculation, as well as all of the Company's accounting books and records
relating to such calculation, and the Company shall make reasonably available
its Representatives responsible for the preparation of such calculations in
order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of Parent. Within five (5)
Business Days after Parent's receipt of the Company's Tax Calculations (unless
earlier waived in writing by Parent), Parent may object, in good faith, to
such calculations by giving written notice to the Company setting forth the
basis for Parent's dispute regarding some or all of such calculations (the
"Parent's Tax Objection"). If Parent does not object to all or any portion of
the Company's Tax Calculations within such five (5) Business Day period (or
earlier waives such objection right in writing), then Parent shall be deemed
to have conclusively agreed with and shall be bound by the Company's Tax
Calculations.

  

  

  

(b) If Parent sends the Parent's Tax Objection on a timely basis, then Parent
and the Company shall confer in good faith in an attempt to resolve the
differences. If, after five (5) Business Days, Parent and the Company cannot
agree, then Parent and the Company shall attempt to agree upon a mutually
satisfactory nationally recognized audit firm (the "Firm") for the resolution
of such differences; _provided_ , that if the parties cannot agree on a
mutually satisfactory nationally recognized auditing firm, then each of Parent
and the Company shall select a nationally recognized auditing firm and the two
firms so selected shall select the Firm. The Firm shall review the Company's
Tax Calculations and the Parent's Tax Objection (as well as any supporting
documents submitted to the Firm by the Company or Parent which are reasonably
related to the Company's Tax Calculations or the Parent's Tax Objection,
respectively) and make a final written determination of the Spin-Off Taxes,
which determination shall be conclusive and binding on Parent and the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Firm determine that the
Spin-Off Taxes are more than the amount set forth in the Parent's Tax
Objection or less than the Spin-Off Taxes set forth in the Company's Tax
Calculations. The determination of the Spin-Off Taxes by the Firm shall be
made as promptly as possible but not later than five (5) Business Days after
the Firm's engagement (unless otherwise agreed to by the Firm, Parent and the
Company). Fifty percent (50%) of the fees and expenses of the Firm will be
allocated to and be included within the calculation of the Spin-Off Taxes.

  

    

(c) The Company shall cause an election to be made pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 336(e) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any corresponding elections under state, local or
foreign Tax law) (a "Section 336(e) Election") with respect to the Spin-Off,
if applicable. In order to effect the Section 336(e) Election pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, on or prior to the date of the Spin-Off, the
Company and Covisint shall enter into a written, binding agreement (a "Section
336(e) Agreement") to make the Section 336(e) Election, as required by
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.336-2(h)(1)(i) or 1.336-2(h)(2)(i), as
applicable, and the Company shall take such other actions, including after the
Closing Date, as may be required to properly make a Section 336(e) Election.
Within 120 days after the Spin-Off, the Company shall provide Covisint with an
allocation statement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section
336(e) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

  

(d) As of the date hereof, there is no fact or circumstance relating to any of
the parties or its respective owners, including any action that it has taken
or agreed to take, that would be reasonably likely to prevent the Spin-Off
from being eligible for a valid Section 336(e) Election, assuming the Merger
is effected. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the date
hereof, there are no related persons (within the meaning of Section 336(e) and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) with respect to Parent that
own any Company Common Stock. Prior to the Closing Date, each party hereto
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Spin-Off to be
eligible for a valid Section 336(e) Election, and shall not take any action
reasonably likely to cause the Spin-Off not to so qualify. From and after the
date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, each of the parties shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within two (2) Business
Days of each of the parties or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives becoming aware of any fact or circumstance relating
to it or its owners, including any action that it has taken or agreed to take,
that would be reasonably likely to prevent the Spin-Off from being eligible
for a valid Section 336(e) Election (assuming the Merger is effected), deliver
to the other party a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail such
facts or circumstances and shall promptly update such notice upon becoming
aware of any changes thereto.

  

  

Section 6.21 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the members of the
Company's Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Laws on
the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

Section 6.22 _Repatriation_. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent's request to transfer in any jurisdiction located
outside of the United States unrestricted cash balances held in commercial
bank accounts in the name of the Company or such Subsidiary to accounts in the
name of the Company or a Subsidiary located in the United States; provided,
however, the foregoing shall not require the Company to incur material Tax
liability with respect to repatriation in advance of the Effective Time unless
the conditions to Closing have been waived.

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
(except to the extent such representations and warranties are expressly made
as of a specific date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
be so true and correct as of such specific date only); _provided_ , _however_
, that the representations and warranties contained in (i) _Section 4.1_
(Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries), _Section 4.3_ (Authority
Relative to Agreement), _Section 4.22_ (Vote Required) and _Section 4.23_

in accordance with _Section 6.20_ and (iii) in the event the Spin-Off occurs,
the Company and Covisint shall have entered into a Section 336(e) Agreement;
_provided,_ that if the sole reason for the failure of the condition in this

jurisdiction having enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law
or Order which is then in effect and has the effect of restraining, enjoining,
rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Spin-Off, then
this condition shall nevertheless be deemed satisfied.

correct as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (except to the extent such representations and warranties are
expressly made as of a specific date, in which case such representations and
warranties shall be so true and correct as of such specific date only); and

cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.3_ or in any other provision of this Agreement, no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from fraud
occurring prior to such termination, in which case, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 8.3_ , the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all
remedies available at law or in equity; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the

then the Company shall, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, no later than two
(2) Business Days following the date of the consummation of such transaction
involving a Competing Proposal, (B) in the case of clause (ii) above, prior to
or substantially concurrently with such termination, and (C) in the case of

event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

  

    

Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than in the case of fraud or as otherwise
permitted by _Section 8.2_ , Parent\'s right to receive the Termination Fee
pursuant to this _Section 8.3(a)_ shall be of no further force or effect if
Parent or any Parent Related Party makes any demand or claim for damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise in any Proceeding against
the Company or any Company Related Party other than for the payment of the
Termination Fee.

  

  

  

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Company pursuant to

covenant or agreement under this Agreement or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or (ii)
the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ if, at the time of such
termination, the Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ , then Parent shall, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, at
the direction of the Company, the Reverse Termination Fee; it being understood
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than in the
case of fraud or as otherwise permitted by _Section 8.2_ , the Company\'s
right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_
shall be of no further force or effect if the Company or any Company Related
Party makes any demand or claim for damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or under the Guaranty or otherwise in any Proceeding against Parent
or any Parent Related Party other than for the payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee.

  

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Company\'s rights set forth in _Section 9.9_ , the Company\'s
receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , in
circumstances where the Reverse Termination Fee is owed pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)_ , shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Company Related Parties against Parent, Acquisition Sub,
the Guarantor, the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, members, equityholders, controlling persons, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, or assignees of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for all losses and
damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Debt Financing to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Financing (except that Parent (but
no Financing Source) shall also be obligated with respect to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3(d)_ , and _Section
8.7_ and for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations
contained in _Section 6.10(e)_ and _Section 6.11_ and the Guarantor shall also
be obligated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Guaranty).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 9.9_ , Parent\'s right to receive payment from the Company
of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ and/or Parent Expenses
pursuant to _Section 8.6_ , in circumstances where the Termination Fee is owed
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(_ i), _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ or _Section
8.3(a)(iii)_ or the Parent Expenses are owed pursuant to _Section 8.6_ , shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Parent Related Parties against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective, direct or indirect, former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, members, equityholders, controlling persons,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees of
any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Company Related Parties") for all
losses and damages suffered as a result of any breach or failure to perform
hereunder giving rise to such termination, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby with respect to such breach or failure to perform (except
that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.2_ ,
_Section 8.3(d)_ and _Section 8.7_ , as applicable). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall be entitled to pursue an injunction, or other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, solely as provided in _Section 9.9_.
For the avoidance of doubt, subject to _Section 9.9_ , the Company may pursue
a grant of specific performance of the type provided in the preceding sentence
and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 8.3(b)_.

  

    

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee, Parent Expenses and the
Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in this
_Section 8.3_ , such paying party shall pay the other party its reasonable and
documented costs and Expenses in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime
rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually
received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

  

  

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after the Requisite Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by
the shareholders of the Company without such further approval of such
shareholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law
and (ii) any amendment of _Section 5.7_ , _Section 6.10_ , _Section 6.11_ ,
this _Section 8.4_ or _Section 8.3_ , _Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.7_ , _Section
9.8_ , _Section 9.9_ , _Section 9.10_ or _Section 9.12_ , in each case to the
extent such amendment would adversely affect the rights of a Financing Source
under such Section, shall also be approved by such Financing Source (or by the
party to the Debt Commitment Letter (or any Financing Agreement resulting
therefrom) affiliated with such Financing Source). This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

  

    

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

Section 8.6 _Expense Reimbursement_. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or (ii) _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ , in each
case, under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , and prior to the time of such termination by
Parent, Parent and Acquisition Sub were not in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
then the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, no later
than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay, or cause
to be paid, at the direction of Parent, up to $4,000,000 of Parent\'s
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Financing) (the "Parent Expenses");
_provided_ , that the existence of circumstances which could require the
Termination Fee to become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(i)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay
the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.6_ ; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section
8.6_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ except to the extent indicated in
_Section 8.3(a)_.

  

Section 8.7 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly set forth herein,
all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses. Parent shall, or, following the Effective Time, shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, timely and duly pay all (i) transfer, stamp and
documentary Taxes or fees and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer
and other similar Taxes or fees arising out of or in connection with entering
into and carrying out this Agreement.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

  

  

(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

  

(b) Disclosure of any fact, circumstance or information in any Section of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosure of such fact,
circumstance or information with respect to any other Section of the Company
Disclosure Letter if it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
that such disclosure relates to any such other Section. The inclusion of any
item in the Company Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission
or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard
of materiality for any purpose whatsoever. Any information or materials
contained in the electronic data room maintained by the Company under the name
"Project Copper 2014" at http://portal.covisint.com at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to have been "made available" to
Parent and Acquisition Sub for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

    

(c) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall
be deemed to include all genders, words denoting natural persons shall be
deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import
shall be deemed to refer to September 2, 2014, unless the context requires
otherwise. When used in reference to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the term
"material" shall be measured against the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute
as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder ( _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date or
dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such statute, as
amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case,
as of such date). Terms defined in the text of this Agreement have such
meaning throughout this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated in this
Agreement, and all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings
when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such Law as
from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
statutes) by succession of comparable successor Laws ( _provided_ , that for
purposes of any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
that are made as of a specific date or dates, references to any statute shall
be deemed to refer to such statute, as amended, and to any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America.

  

  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon contained in
_Section 8.3(c)_ and _Section 8.3(d)_ be construed as an integral provision of
this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable
in any manner that increases a party\'s liability or obligations hereunder or
under the Financing Commitments or the Guarantees.

  

  

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
Acquisition Sub may (without obtaining any prior written consent) transfer or
assign their rights and obligations under this Agreement (in whole but not in
part) to (a) Parent or any of its Affiliates and/or to any parties providing
the Financing pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in
respect of such Financing), and (b) after the Effective Time, any Person,
provided that, in each case, no such transfer or assignment shall relieve
Parent or Acquisition Sub of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 9.5_ shall
be null and void.

  

    

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Voting
Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guaranty, the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter, the entire agreement, and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically
intended that (A) the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 6.6_
from and after the Effective Time), (B) the Financing Sources under the Debt
Financing (with respect to _Section 5.7_ , _Section 6.10_ , _Section 6.11_ ,
_Section 8.3_ , _Section 8.4_ , _Section 9.4_ , _Section 9.5_ , this _Section
9.7_ , _Section 9.8_ , _Section 9.9(b)(v)_ , _Section 9.10_ , and _Section
9.12_ , each of which shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
each Financing Source, its Affiliates and their respective successors and
permitted assigns) and (C) the Parent Related Parties (with respect to
_Section 8.3_ and _Section 9.9_ ) and the Company Related Parties (with
respect to _Section_ _8.3_ and _Section 9.9_ ) are third-party beneficiaries.

  

  

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and all Proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware (except (i)
to the extent that the corporate laws of the State of Michigan are mandatorily
applicable and (ii) with respect to the matters otherwise covered by paragraph
(b) of this _Section 9.8_ and any other matters concerning the Debt Financing,
the Debt Commitment Letters, the Financing Sources or any of their rights,
obligations, actions or omissions with respect thereto).

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person
in any Proceeding before any Governmental Authority of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, in any forum other than the United States Federal and New York State
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York County, State of New York
and (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letters, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any
way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

  

    

Section 9.9 _Remedies_.

  

  

(a) _Remedies of Parent and Acquisition Sub_.

  

  

(i) _Specific Performance_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described
in _Section 9.10_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
including the Company\'s obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(ii) _Termination Fee_. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the Termination
Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_.

  

  

(iii) _Expense Reimbursement_. Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement of
Parent Expenses if and when payable pursuant to _Section 8.6_.

  

  

(iv) _Termination_. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1_.

  

  

(v) _Monetary Damages_. Other than in the case of fraud or otherwise
explicitly permitted under _Section 8.2_ in no event shall Parent or any
Parent Related Party have the right to seek or obtain money damages from the
Company or any Company Related Party under this Agreement (whether at law or
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) other than the right of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to payment of the Termination Fee as set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_ or Parent Expenses as set forth in _Section 8.6_.

  

  

(b) _Remedies of the Company_.

  

  

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants_ ). Prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ and other than as it
relates to the right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger (which are governed by the provisions of _Section
9.9(b)(ii)_ ), the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub in the courts described in _Section
9.10_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

  

    

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , the Company shall be entitled to seek
and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable remedies to
enforce Parent\'s and Acquisition Sub\'s obligations to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only in the event that
each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which
shall be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied at the
time the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity
Financing to be funded, and remain satisfied, (ii) the Debt Financing (or, if
alternative financing is being used in accordance with _Section 6.10(c)_ ,
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded in
accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the
terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing
and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
the Parent\'s right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete
the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no event
shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of
this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this _Section 9.9(b)(ii)_ and in no event shall the
Company be entitled to seek any remedy of specific performance or any such
remedy against any Financing Source.

  

  

(iii) _Reverse Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of
the Reverse Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_.

  

  

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8.1_.

  

  

(v) _Monetary Damages_. Other than in the case of fraud or otherwise
explicitly permitted under _Section 8.2_ , in no event shall the Company or
any Company Related Party have the right to seek or obtain money damages or
expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) from Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Guarantor, the Financing Sources
or any other Parent Related Party other than the right of the Company to
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee as set forth in _Section 8.3(b)_ and to
enforce its rights under the Guaranty. In addition, and notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and each Company
Related Party hereby waives any and all claims against the Financing Sources
and hereby agrees that in no event shall the Financing Sources have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any Company Related Party relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.9(b)(v)_ shall in
any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent, Acquisition Sub
or the Financing Sources set forth under the Debt Commitment Letters. In
addition to the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall be entitled,
at Parent and Acquisition Sub\'s sole election, to settle any claims arising
from or relating to this Agreement by consummating the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

  

    

(c) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this _Section 9.9_ , the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of
this _Section 9.9_ , the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
_Section 9.10_ without proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit
rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the
terms of this _Section 9.9_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (to the extent that the right of specific performance is explicitly
applicable under the terms of this _Section 9.9_ ) shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

  

  

(d) _Sole Remedy_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.9_ shall be the parties\' sole and exclusive
remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(e) _Extension of Termination Date_. To the extent any party hereto brings a
Proceeding to specifically enforce the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 9.9_ (other than an action
to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives the termination
of this Agreement), the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to
(i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such
Proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding
over such Proceeding.

  

  

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly and irrevocably submits to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of
Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the state courts of
the State of Delaware, or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware,
(d) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and (e) agrees that
each of the other parties shall have the right to bring any Proceeding for
enforcement of a judgment entered by the state courts of the State of Delaware
or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. The parties hereby further
agree that New York state or United States Federal courts sitting in New York
County, State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) brought against
any Financing Source in connection with the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

  

    

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section 9.10(a)_ in any
such Proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified United
States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as
specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_. However, the foregoing shall not
limit the right of a party to effect service of process on the other party by
any other legally available method.

  

  

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF (INCLUDING
THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS AND DEBT FINANCING).

  

  

[Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page follows.]

  

    

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
