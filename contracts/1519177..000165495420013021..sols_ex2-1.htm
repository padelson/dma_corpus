ARTICLE VIII. INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

 

Section 8.01 Indemnification of Company. Provided that the Closing occurs,
the Eagle Lake Shareholders, jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the
Company, each of its Affiliates and each of its and their respective members,
managers, partners, directors, officers, employees, stockholders, attorneys
and agents and permitted assignees and the Shareholders'
Representative (each a "Company Indemnified Party"), against and in respect
of any and all out-of-pocket loss, cost, payments, demand, penalty,
forfeiture, expense, liability, judgment, deficiency or damage, and
diminution in value or claim (including actual costs of investigation and
attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses) (all of the foregoing
collectively, "Losses" and each individually a "Loss") incurred or
sustained by any Company Indemnified Party as a result of or in
connection with (a) any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the
alleged breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Eagle Lake
Parties contained herein or in any of the additional agreements or
any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto, and (b)
any Actions by any third parties with respect to the business or operations
of Eagle Lake for any period on or prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, with respect to any indemnification obligations of the Eagle
Lake Shareholders arising from any Losses as a result of or in connection
with any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged breach,
inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of any Eagle Lake Shareholder as set forth
in Section 3.07 or Section 3.12, such indemnification obligations shall be
solely the obligations of the Eagle Lake Shareholder giving such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements from which such claim
arose, severally and not jointly and severally.

 

 

Section 8.02 Indemnification of the Eagle Lake Parties. Provided that
the Closing occurs, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law the Shareholders'
Representative, the Eagle Lake Shareholders, Eagle Lake and each of its
officers, directors, employees, stockholders, attorneys and agents and
permitted assignees (each a "Eagle Lake Indemnified Party"), against and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred or sustained by any Eagle
Lake Indemnified Party as a result of or in connection with any
breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment or the alleged breach, inaccuracy
or nonfulfillment of any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Company contained herein or in any of the additional
agreements or any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 8.03 Procedure. The following shall apply with respect to all
claims by any Eagle Lake Indemnified Party or Company Indemnified Party for
indemnification with respect to actions by third-parties (with any references
herein to an "Indemnified Party" being a reference to an Eagle
Lake Indemnified Party or a Company Indemnified Party, as applicable, and
any references herein to an "Indemnifying Party" being a reference to the
Company or the Eagle Lake Shareholders, as applicable):

 

 

 

 

 (a)

 

Third-Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion
or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or
a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of
such notice of such Third-Party Claim. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable,
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 8.03(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-
Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof, provided that the fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b)

 

Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, except as provided in this Section 8.03(b). If a firm offer is made to
settle a Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree
to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that
effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to
such firm offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim
and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to
assume defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle
the Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle
such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
pursuant to Section 8.03(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c)

 

Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which
does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of
such Direct Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
thirty (30) calendar days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to
what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (d)

 

Cooperation. Upon a reasonable request made by the Indemnifying Party, each
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder in respect of any Direct
Claim, hereby agrees to consult with the Indemnifying Party and act
reasonably to take actions reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party
in order to attempt to reduce the amount of Losses in respect of such Direct
Claim. Any costs or expenses associated with taking such actions shall be
included as Losses hereunder.

 

 

 

 

Section 8.04 Periodic Payments. Any indemnification required by this
Article VIII for costs, disbursements or expenses of any Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Action
shall be made by periodic payments by the Indemnifying Party to each
Indemnified Party during the course of the investigation or defense, as
and when bills are received or costs, disbursements or expenses
are incurred.

 

 

Section 8.05 Insurance. Any indemnification payments hereunder shall take
into account any insurance proceeds or other third-party reimbursement
actually received.

 

 

Section 8.06 Time Limit. The obligations of the Eagle Lake Shareholders and
the Company under Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 shall expire two (2) years
from the Closing Date, except with respect to (i) an indemnification claim
asserted in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII which
remains unresolved, for which the obligation to indemnify shall
continue until such claim is resolved; and (ii) resolved claims for
which payment has not yet been paid to the Indemnified Party.

 

 

Section 8.07 Certain Limitations.

 

 

  The indemnification provided for in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02
shall be subject to the following limitations:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (a)

 

The Eagle Lake Shareholders shall not be liable to the Company Indemnified
Parties for indemnification under Section 8.01 until the aggregate amount of
all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 8.01 exceeds $10,000
(the "Basket"), in which event the Eagle Lake Shareholders shall be required
to pay or be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Basket up to a
maximum amount equal to the value of the Exchange Shares on the Closing Date
as received by the Eagle Lake Shareholders as determined by reference to the
Share Price (the "Cap"), and provided that, in the event that the
indemnification obligations are those of less than all of the Eagle Lake
Shareholders pursuant to the last sentence of Section 8.01, then the Basket
and the Cap shall be applied to such indemnifying Eagle Lake Shareholder(s)
pro rata based on the number of shares of Eagle Lake Stock held by
such Eagle Lake Shareholder(s) as of the Closing Date, such that, by way of
example and not limitation. if an Eagle Lake Shareholder is so obligated to
indemnify the Company Indemnified Parties pursuant to such section and held
50% of the total shares of Eagle Lake Stock as of the Closing Date, the
Basket would be $5,000 and the Cap would be 50% of the total value of the
Exchange Shares on the Closing Date as received by the Eagle Lake
Shareholders as determined by reference to the Share Price. Any such
utilization or satisfaction of the Basket and the Cap by one or more of the
Eagle Lake Shareholders as a result of the preceding sentence shall apply to
any later determinations of the utilization or satisfaction of the Basket and
the Cap.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b)

 

The Company shall not be liable to the Eagle Lake Indemnified Parties
for indemnification under Section 8.02 until the aggregate amount of all
Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 8.02 exceeds the Basket,
in which event the Company shall be required to pay or be liable for all such
Losses in excess of the Basket up to a maximum amount equal to the Cap, which
shall in such case be applied to all of the Eagle Lake Shareholders as
a group.

 

 

 

 

Section 8.08 Effect of Investigation. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and any indemnified party's right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the any indemnified
party's or by reason of the fact that such indemnified party knew or should
have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might
be inaccurate.

 

 

Section 8.09 Exclusive Remedy. In the event that the Closing occurs, the
indemnification provisions contained in this Article VIII shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or any
other provision of this Agreement or arising out of the
transactions contemplated herein, except (i) with respect to any
equitable remedy to which such Party may be entitled to with respect to
any claims or causes of action arising from the breach of any covenants or
agreement of a Party that is to be performed subsequent to the Closing Date,
or (ii) with respect to a Party, an actual and intentional fraud with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each Party, for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates,
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law and except as otherwise specified in
this Article VIII, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against any other Party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
or any other agreement, certificate or other document or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, arising under or based upon any applicable law.

before one arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"). Binding arbitration shall be the
sole means of resolving any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (including with respect to the meaning, effect,

The costs of the arbitration proceeding and any proceeding in court to

arbitration for any reason, including that such Party shall have been the
subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

Section 9.14 Amendment; Waiver; Remedies; Agent.

 

 

 

 

 (a)

 

This Agreement may be amended, modified, superseded, terminated or cancelled,
and any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties or conditions
hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by the Company,
Eagle Lake and the Shareholders' Representative.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b)

 

Every right and remedy provided herein shall be cumulative with every other
right and remedy, whether conferred herein, at law, or in equity, and may be
enforced concurrently herewith, and no waiver by any Party of the performance
of any obligation by the other shall be construed as a waiver of the same or
any other default then, theretofore, or thereafter occurring or existing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c)

 

Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder or
in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of dealing
shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any Party from enforcing any right or
remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to or
demand on a Party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that Party or
impairs any right of the Party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise
required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any
other right or remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved Party whole with
respect to such breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with
respect to any other breach.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.15 Eagle Lake Shareholders' Representative.

 

 

 

 

 (a)

 

Each Eagle Lake Shareholder constitutes and appoints the
Shareholders' Representative as its representative and its true and
lawful attorney in fact, with full power and authority in its name and
on its behalf:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (i)

 

to act on such Eagle Lake Shareholders' behalf in the absolute discretion
of Shareholders' Representative with respect to all matters relating to this
Agreement, including execution and delivery of any amendment, supplement, or
modification of this Agreement and any waiver of any claim or right arising
out of this Agreement or the provision of any consent or agreement hereunder;
and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (ii)

 

in general, to do all things and to perform all acts, including executing
and delivering all agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, and
other instruments contemplated by or deemed advisable to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 9.15.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b)

 

This appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest
and is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in this Agreement
and is irrevocable and will not be terminated by any act of any Eagle Lake
Shareholder or by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity of any
Eagle Lake Shareholder or by the occurrence of any other event. Each Eagle
Lake Shareholder hereby consents to the taking of any and all actions and the
making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken or made by
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to this Section 9.15. Each Eagle
Lake Shareholder agrees that Shareholders' Representative shall have no
obligation or liability to any Person for any action taken or omitted by
Shareholders' Representative in good faith, even if taken or omitted
negligently, and each Eagle Lake Shareholder shall indemnify and hold
harmless Shareholders' Representative from, and shall pay to
Shareholders' Representative the amount of, or reimburse
Shareholders' Representative for, any Loss that Shareholders' Representative
may suffer, sustain, or become subject to as a result of any claim made or
threatened against Shareholders' Representative in his capacity as such.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c)

 

The Company shall be entitled to rely upon any document or other paper
delivered by Shareholders' Representative as being authorized by Eagle Lake
Shareholders, and the Company shall not be liable to any Eagle Lake
Shareholder for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Company based
on such reliance.

 

 

 

 

Section 9.16 Arm's Length Bargaining; No Presumption Against Drafter. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the Parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any Party in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made
based upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

 

 

Section 9.17 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are
intended solely for convenience and shall not affect the rights of
the Parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 9.18 No Assignment or Delegation. No Party may assign any right or
delegate any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation,
operation of law, or otherwise, without the written consent of all of the
other Parties and any purported assignment or delegation without such consent
shall be void, in addition to constituting a material breach of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding on the permitted successors and
assigns of the Parties.

 

 

Section 9.19 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each Eagle Lake Party and the Company shall
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to perform or fulfill
all conditions and obligations to be performed or fulfilled by it under this
Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated
as soon as practicable, and to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.

 

 

Section 9.20 Further Assurances. From and after the Effective Date, each
Party shall execute and deliver such documents and take such action, as may
reasonably be considered within the scope of such Party's obligations
hereunder, necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

Section 9.21 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of the provisions hereof and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, without the proof of actual damages, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party
agrees to waive any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in
connection with any such equitable remedy, and agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that (a) the other Party has an adequate remedy at law, or (b)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity.

 

 

Section .22 Counsel. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Anthony L.G.,
PLLC ("Counsel") has acted as legal counsel to the Company, Eagle Lake and
certain of the Eagle Lake Shareholders. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that they are aware of, and have consented to, the Counsel acting as
legal counsel to each of the foregoing, notwithstanding that Counsel has
advised each of the Parties to retain separate counsel to review the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the other documents to be delivered in
connection herewith, and each applicable Party has either waived such right
freely or has otherwise sought such additional counsel as it has deemed
necessary. Each of the Parties hereby waives any such conflict of interest
resulting from Counsel's representation of each of the applicable
Parties, and confirms that the Parties have previously negotiated
the material terms of the agreements as set forth herein.

 

 

Section .23 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
taken together shall be but a single instrument. The execution and delivery
ofa facsimile or other electronic transmission of a signature to
this Agreement shall constitute delivery of an executed original and shall
be binding upon the person whose signature appears on the transmitted copy.
