would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction without proof
of damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. The right for specific enforcement shall include the right
of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Offer, the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy
of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. If, prior to the Walk-Away Date, any Party
brings any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any
other Party, the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended by (x)&nbsp;the amount of time during
which such action is pending, plus twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days or (y)&nbsp;such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action.
