**1.4** **_Purchase  Price_**.  (a) The  purchase price for the Acquired

       (i)   |  

the  Initial Cash Purchase Price, as determined in Section 1.4(b), 

    
---|--- 
    

       (ii)   |  

the  total Contingent Payments, described in Section 1.4(d),  and

       (iii)   |  

the  Final Net Working Capital Adjustment (as defined in Section 
1.6(f)(vi)).

    
---|--- 
    

 

(b) The  " **Initial  Cash Purchase Price** " equals  $122,000,000 _minus_
  any  decrease resulting from the Initial Working Capital Adjustment (as
defined  in  Section 1.6(f)(v) below) or _plus_   the  amount of any
increase resulting from the Initial Net Working Capital  Adjustment. The
balance of the Initial Cash Purchase Price, after giving effect  to the
deposit of the Escrowed Amount described in Section 1.4(c) below, will  be 
by paid by Buyer to Seller at Closing via wire transfer of immediately
available  funds, pursuant to wiring instructions set forth on a closing
statement executed  by both parties.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Buyer  shall deposit Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,500,000) of the  Initial Cash Purchase Price ("the **Escrowed  Amount**
")  by  wire transfer at Closing into an escrow account of the escrow agent
chosen  by  the parties prior to Closing (" **Escrow  Agent** ").  The 
Escrowed Amount will be held and delivered by the Escrow Agent in accordance 
with the terms and provisions of the " **Escrow  Agreement,** " in  a 
form satisfactory to each of the parties, which, in part, provides that the 
Escrow Amount shall be used as security for Sellers' indemnification
obligations  set forth in Article V below; provided, however, that the
Escrowed Funds shall  not be the limit of Seller's obligations, if any. All
interest accruing on the  Escrowed Amount shall inure to the account of the
Seller.

 

 



 

(d) _Contingent  Additional Purchase Price_. 

 



 

(i) Subsequent  to Closing and in accordance with this Section 1.4(d), Seller
shall have the  right to receive, and Buyer shall pay as to the Seller,
contingent additional  Purchase Price up to a maximum of Eight Million
Dollars ($8,000,000) (the " **Contingent  Payment** ")  together with
interest thereon pursuant to **_Exhibit  1.4(d)(i)_**   attached  hereto.
Buyer agrees that during the Contingent Payment Period (as defined  in 
Exhibit 1.4(d)(i)) it will not take any action or refrain from taking any
action  in the S3 Business, a purpose of which is to prevent or reduce any
Contingent  Payments or Seller from earning the Maximum Contingent Payment
Amount (as  defined in Exhibit 1.4(d)(i)).

 



 

(ii) The  Contingent Payment Statement (defined in **_Exhibit  1.4(d)(i)_**
)  shall  be subject to review and verification by the Seller. Buyer shall
permit the  Seller and its representatives to have reasonable access (upon
Seller's  execution and delivery of Buyer's accountant's standard
waiver/access letter, if  required) to the data and information on which such
Contingent Payment Statement  was prepared and to Buyer's employees and
representatives who assisted in its  preparation to the extent necessary to
verify such information. The Seller  shall  be deemed to have accepted as
final the Contingent Payment Statement unless,  within thirty (30) days after
the date of delivery of the Contingent Payment  Statement to Seller, the
Seller gives written notice of objection to Buyer  to  any item thereon,
which objection shall specify in reasonable detail the basis  for such
objection, in which case Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith  to
resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. If a final resolution thereof 
is not obtained within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of
Seller's  objection to Buyer the parties will engage Cohen and Company (the "
**Independent** **Auditor** "),  who  shall resolve any remaining
differences concerning such calculations. The  Independent Auditor's
resolution shall be final and binding on the parties. The  fees and expenses
of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by Buyer if its  calculation of the
aggregate Contingent Payments was incorrect by more than  two  percent (2%)
and otherwise such fees and expenses shall be borne by the  Seller.

 

 

(iii) Buyer  shall pay Seller any unpaid portion of the Contingent Payment
determined to  be  due to Seller (and in the event that the determination is
that Buyer has  overpaid Seller, Seller shall reimburse Buyer) not later than
five (5) business  days after the determination thereof becomes final.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(iv) Seller\'s  right to receive the Contingent Payment, as outlined above,
shall survive the  Closing and the Closing Date and shall be enforceable from
and after the Closing  Date against Buyer.  The  right to receive the
Contingent Payment may not be assigned or utilized as  collateral by the
Seller without the prior written consent of the  Buyer.

 

 

**1.5** **_Assumption  of Liabilities_**. 

 

 

(a) At  the  Closing, Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, discharge or
perform, as  appropriate, all liabilities and obligations of the Business
accrued or arising  before or after the Closing, including, but not limited
to, the following,  but  excluding all Retained Liabilities as hereinafter
defined, (the " **Assumed  Liabilities** "):

 

 

(i) the  leases and Contracts described on _Schedule  1.1(d)_ ;

 

 

(ii) all  accrued trade accounts payable, which shall be estimated on the
Estimated  Statement of Net Working Capital and finalized with the Final
Statement of  Net  Working Capital;

 

 

(iii) all  accrued expenses and operating liabilities (including sales, real
and personal  property taxes, accrued bonus, and any vacation pay) incurred
in the ordinary  course of operating the Business, which, except for vacation
pay, shall be  estimated on the Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital
and finalized with  the Final Statement of Net Working Capital; and

 

 

(iv) all  warranty claims in connection with products sold by the Seller in
the Business;  provided, however, subject to the Seller's reimbursement
obligations set forth  in Section 5.1(f) and (g).

 

 

For  purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that in the event
that  Seller has overlooked the accrual of a trade accounts payable or the
accrual  of  an expense or operating liability for the Business under
Sections 1.5(a) (ii)  or  (iii) on the Estimated Statement of Net Working
Capital, Seller shall be  entitled to submit to Buyer such accrual for
inclusion on the Final Statement  of  Net Working Capital.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Buyer shall not assume or agree to pay,
discharge or perform  any  of the following liabilities or obligations (the
" **Retained  Liabilities** ")  arising out of:

 

 

(i)  certain  trade accounts payable that are noted as retained by Seller
on the Estimated  Statement of Net Working Capital and finalized with the
Final Statement of  Net  Working Capital;

 

 

(ii) Any  claims made or threatened by, or on behalf of (e.g., a claim
brought by the  EEOC) any employee or independent contractor (performing
duties in the nature  of  an employee of the Business), including, without
limitation, any claims relating  to or arising out of any tort (intentional
or otherwise) or violation of law  relating to discrimination, harassment,
wrongful termination or other similar  matters;

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) any  condition or liability arising on or before the Closing Date which
violates  or  is alleged to violate any Environmental, Health and Safety
Laws;

 

 

(iv) income,  franchise or other similar taxes;

 

 

(v) Retained  Employees (as hereinafter defined);

 

 

(vi) any  funded debt of Seller associated with the Business;

 

 

(vii) the  liabilities and obligations retained by Seller pursuant to Section
4.1(c);  and

 

 

(viii) the  complaint by Mr. George Hanson as described on _Schedule  2.15_.

 

 

(c) Except  as  expressly provided in this Section 1.5, it is understood and
agreed that Buyer  does not assume or agree hereunder or otherwise to pay,
perform or discharge  any  debt, obligation, tax or liability, known or
unknown, contingent or otherwise,  of Seller of any kind or nature whatsoever
including, without limitation, any  income or franchise tax obligations of
Seller.

 

 

**1.6** **_Statements  of Net Working Capital and Determination of Net
Working Capital  Adjustment._**

 

 

(a) _Seller 's  Preparation of Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital_. 
One (1)  business day prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall have
executed and  delivered to Buyer an estimated statement of Net Working
Capital as of the  Closing Date (" **Estimated  Statement of Net Working
Capital** "),  which  shall have been prepared in a manner consistent with
the calculation of the  Net  Working Capital **** Threshold  Amount, as
such calculation is further described on _Schedule  1.6(a)_.  The 
Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital shall include a calculation of
the  Initial Net Working Capital Adjustment (as defined below in Section
1.6(f)(v))  and Accounts Receivable detail listing for the Accounts
Receivable on the  Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital; provided,
however, that Buyer shall  have the option at Closing to not accept the
assignment of certain Accounts  Receivable set forth on the Estimated
Statement of Net Working Capital, shall  identify those Accounts Receivable
that shall remain with Seller and the Initial  Net Working Capital Adjustment
shall be correspondingly reduced; provided,  however, that in no event shall
Buyer have the option not to accept any Accounts  Receivable owed by it or
its affiliates.

 

 

(b) _Buyer 's  Preparation of Final Statement of Net Working Capital_.  As 
promptly as possible following the close of business on the Closing Date,
but  in  no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall  prepare a proposed Final Statement of Net Working Capital, 
which  shall be consistent with the calculation of the Net Working Capital
Threshold  Amount (including the stated amount of reserves). The parties
agree that the  reserve in respect of  obsolescence shall be One Hundred
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000) and  no  further adjustment to
Inventory or such reserve shall be made in respect of  obsolete or unsaleable
Inventory. For purposes of clarity, in no event shall  any  determination or
calculation of Inventory and/or the reserves in respect thereof  made by
Seller in the Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital be subject  to 
modification by Buyer, except in the case of manifest error in determining 
the  cost or quantity thereof. If,  based  on the Buyer's calculations, the
proposed Final Statement of Net Working Capital  contains a proposed Final
Net Working Capital Adjustment that results in an  increase to the Purchase
Price (as compared to the Estimated Statement of Net  Working Capital), the
Buyer will pay in cash that increased amount to the Seller  at the time the
proposed Final Statement of Net Working Capital is delivered  in  accordance
with this Section 1.6(b).

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Seller 's  Review._ **** Seller **** shall  have a period of thirty
(30) days following delivery to it of the proposed  Final  Statement of Net
Working Capital to review, at the expense of the Seller, the  proposed Final
Statement of Net Working Capital and the computation of the  proposed Final
Net Working Capital Adjustment. Buyer agrees to provide, or  cause  to be
provided, to Seller or its designated representatives materials or 
information in its possession in order for Seller to review the preparation 
of  the proposed Final Statement of Net Working Capital and the computation
of  the  proposed Final Net Working Capital Adjustment. In the event that
Seller does  not  provide written notice to Buyer within such thirty (30)
day period that Seller  disagrees with the proposed Final Statement of Net
Working Capital and/or the  computation of the proposed Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment (" **Notice  of Disagreement** "),  then  such Final
Statement of Net Working Capital shall be deemed final.

 

 

(d) _Independent  Review._   In the  event Seller provides Buyer with a
Notice of Disagreement and the parties have  not resolved such disagreement
within thirty (30) days after the date of  delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement, the parties shall submit to an  Independent Auditor such
Estimated Statement of Net Working Capital, the  proposed Final Statement of
Net Working Capital and computation of the proposed  Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment, _Schedule  1.6(a)_ ,  the  Notice of Disagreement, and
any other documents or information which the parties  deem, or the
Independent Auditor deems, pertinent in order to make a final  and  binding
determination of any issues as to which the parties are in disagreement.  The
Independent Auditor shall advise the parties of its decision relative to 
the  controversy within sixty (60) days (or as soon as practicable) after its
receipt  of the applicable statements and other documents or information
which it has  requested and at such time the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment as  determined by the Independent Accountant shall be deemed
final. Such firm shall  be acting as an arbitrator and not as an auditor and
shall decide only those  issues as to which the parties are not in agreement.
The fees and expenses  of  the Independent Auditor shall be equally
apportioned between the Buyer and  the  Seller.

 

 

(e) _Payment  of Final Net Working Capital Adjustment._   Within  ten (10)
days after the final determination of the Final Net Working Capital 
Adjustment as provided in either Section 1.6(c) or Section 1.6(d):

 

 

(i)  if  the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment is an increase from the
Initial Cash  Purchase Price as described in Section 1.6(f)(vi)(B), Buyer
shall pay to Seller  such increase in cash, together with interest thereon
from the Closing Date  to  the date of payment thereof, based on an annual
compounded rate equal to the  "prime rate" as published in _The  Wall Street
Journal_   on the  date of determination of the Final Net Working Capital
Adjustment compounded  annually (the " **Prime  Rate** "),  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(ii)  if  the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment is a decrease from the
Initial Cash  Purchase Price as described in Section 1.6(f)(vi)(A), Buyer
shall be entitled  to  recover such decrease in cash, together with interest
thereon from the Closing  Date to the date of payment thereof at the Prime
Rate, directly from Seller  for  any amount owing to Buyer.

 

 

In  the  event that a party (other than the Escrow Agent) does not make its
total payment  as required by this Section 1.6, then the unpaid amount shall
accrue interest  at  a rate equal to the Prime Rate plus five percent (5%)
until fully  paid.

breach of or default under any of the Assumed Liabilities or  give rise to a
right of termination by any party thereto.

 

 

**2.10** **_Employees_**.  Seller  has not received written notice of and to
Seller's knowledge (as defined in  Section 7.4 below) there exists no basis
for any grievances or claims of unfair  labor practices relating to the
employees of the Business. For purposes of  this  Agreement, the phrase
"employees of the Business" or other words to that effect  shall mean
employees of Seller predominantly utilized in the furtherance of  the 
Business. With respect to the employees of the Business, Seller has not
engaged  in any patterns or practices that have resulted in employment-
related claims  being filed against Seller with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission  or  any similar federal or state agency or court.
Except as shown on _Schedule  2.10_ ,  or  otherwise not paid or payable in
the ordinary course of business, Seller has  paid or accrued all wages,
bonuses, vacation pay, sick pay and other  compensation to all employees of
the Business for all periods prior to the  Closing Date. Except as shown on

employees of the Business regarding  compensation or other aspects of
employment, and all employees have been  employed by Seller at will, except

ordinary course of the Business.  Seller is not a party to or bound by any
collective bargaining or other labor  agreement with respect the employees of
the Business, and there are no labor  unions or other organizations
representing or, to the knowledge of the Seller  purporting to represent or
attempting to represent, any employees of the  Business. To Seller's
knowledge, no organizational effort is presently being  made or threatened by
or on behalf of any labor union with respect to employees  of the Business.

periods prior to the  Closing Date and no accumulated funding deficiency or
liquidity shortfall (as  defined in Section 302 of ERISA) has been incurred
with respect to any such  Employee Plan. The funded status of each Employee
Plan maintained by Seller  is  set forth on _Schedule  2.11(b)_.  Seller

years and periods for which such  reports were required and within the time
period required by ERISA and the  Code.  Copies of all such Form 5500
reports required to be filed by Seller for the  past  three years have been
provided to Buyer for any Employee Plans to be assumed  by  Buyer hereunder.

 

 

(d) All  Employee Plans currently maintained or contributed to by Seller that
are  intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code are currently
subject  to favorable determination letters issued by the Internal Revenue

Section 4975 of  the Code, has occurred with respect to any Employee Plan,
and, to the knowledge  of Seller, no civil or criminal action brought

auditing or reviewing any Employee Plan and the Seller  has  not received
written notice of any impending audit or review of any such  Employee Plan
from the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of  Labor.

 

 

(f) Neither  the Seller nor any affiliated entity (hereafter referred to as
"ERISA  Affiliate") that together with the Seller are deemed a "single
employer" within  the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA, currently
maintain any Employee  Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor have
previously maintained any  such Employee Plan within the past five years that
has resulted in any liability  or potential liability to the Seller or its
ERISA Affiliates under said Title  IV.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Neither  the Seller nor its ERISA Affiliates maintain, or has contributed
to within  the  past five years, any multi-employer plan, within the meaning

material  compliance with the applicable requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of
Subtitle B  of  Title I of ERISA, and Sections 9801 and 9802 of the Code and
the regulations  thereunder. Seller has not contributed to a non-conforming
group health plan,  as  that term is defined in Section 5000(c) of the Code,
or incurred any tax  liability under Section 5000(a) of the Code. Each
Employee Plan that is a group  health plan has been operated in material
compliance with the applicable  requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code
and Sections 601 through 608 of  ERISA.

 

 

(j) Seller  has not incurred any excise tax liability that has not been
satisfied as of  the  Closing Date with respect to any Employee Plan.

 

 

(k) The  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i)  entitle any current or former employee of Seller to severance pay,
unemployment  compensation, accrued vacation pay, or any similar payment for
which Buyer  could  be liable except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
(ii) accelerate the  time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of any
compensation to or  in  respect of any current or former employee of Sellers
for which Buyer could  be  liable, or (iii) result in or satisfy any
condition to the payment of  compensation to any current or former employee
of Seller for which Buyer could  be liable that would, in combination with
any other payment, result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the  Code.

 

 

The  foregoing representations and warranties are limited to and are given

compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety  Laws.

 

 

(d) No  hazardous substance has been disposed of, spilled or otherwise

**2.24** **_Applicable  Time Period_**.  To the  extent that any of the
foregoing representations or warranties refers to  activity or conduct by the
Seller or the occurrence of prior events, such  representation shall be
deemed to refer only to the five (5) year period  immediately preceding the

_Schedule  2.25_   or in  the Financial Statements and except for a
liability or obligation of the type  or  nature that is specifically

arising from of an action, inaction or event  occurring prior to Closing.

 

 

**_ARTICLE  III_**

 

 

**_REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER_**

 

 

Buyer  hereby represents and warrants to Seller as of the date hereof, as 
follows:

 

 

**3.1** **_Organization_**.  Buyer  is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under  the  laws of the Commonwealth of

this Agreement.

 

 

**3.2** **_Authority_**.  Buyer  has full corporate power and authority and
legal right to enter into this  Agreement and to consummate the transactions

approve the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement have been duly taken
as required by applicable law and any  applicable agreements. This Agreement
and the other agreements, documents and  instruments required to be delivered
by Buyer in accordance with the provisions  hereof have been duly executed by
Buyer and constitute the valid and binding  agreement of Buyer, enforceable
against it in accordance with their respective  terms.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

**3.3** **_Absence  of Violations or Conflicts_**.  The  execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation and performance  by  Buyer
of the transactions contemplated herein and therein (a) will not violate, 
conflict with or result in the breach of any term, condition or provision
of,  or  require the consent of any other period under (a) to Buyer's
knowledge, any  existing law, ordinance, or governmental rule or regulation
to which Buyer  is  subject, (b) any judgment, order, writ, injunction,
decree or award of any  court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory
official, body or authority  which is applicable to Buyer, (c) the charter,
bylaws or any other  organizational documents of Buyer or any securities
issued by Buyer, or (d)  any  mortgage, indenture, or other material
instrument, document or agreement, oral  or written, to which Buyer is a

assets may be bound or affected. Except for  authorizations, approvals,
consents, registrations and filing that have either  been obtained,
registered or filed, no authorization, approval or consent of,  and no
registration or filing with, any governmental or regulatory official,  body
or authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or 
performance of this Agreement by Buyer.

 



 

**3.4** **_Litigation_**.  No  litigation, including any arbitration,
investigation or other proceeding of  or  before any court, arbitrator or
governmental or regulatory official, body or  authority, is pending or, to
the knowledge of Buyer, threatened against Buyer  which would be likely to
have a material adverse effect on Buyer, nor does  Buyer, to its knowledge,
know of any reasonably likely basis for any such  litigation, arbitration,
investigation or proceeding, the result of which could  materially and
adversely affect Buyer. Buyer is not a party to or subject to  the 
provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any 
court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory official, body or  authority.

 



  

3.5  No Actual Knowledge of Incorrect Representation. To the actual
knowledge  of the following employees of Buyer: George Off, Craig Burns, John
Van Zile  and  Per Levin, Buyer is not aware of any fact or circumstance
that would make  any  representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
Article II above materially  incorrect or untrue.

  

 

**3.6** **_Brokers_**.  Buyer  has not dealt with any broker or finder in
connection with any of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
insofar as it knows, no broker  or other person is entitled to any commission
or finder's fee in connection with  any of these transactions.

 

 

**_ARTICLE  IV_**

 



 

**_OTHER  AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

**4.1** **_Employees_**.

 

 

(a) Except  for the employees of Seller (the " **Retained  Employees** ") 
as set  forth on _Schedule  4.1(a)_ ,  as of  Closing, Buyer shall offer
at-will employment to all persons who are employees  of the Business at such
time (the " **Continuing  Employees** ").  Seller shall attach a list of all
Continuing Employees, their rate of  compensation, job title and exempt/non-
exempt status. It is Seller's present  intention to retain the employment of
those individuals listed on _Schedule  4.1(a)_.  Based  on the foregoing
covenant of Buyer, Seller has made no filings, given no notices  or otherwise
complied with the WARN Act (29 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.) and similar  state laws
(" **WARN  Laws** "). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(b) From  and  after the Closing Date, Buyer will evaluate each of Seller's
bonus and other  compensation plans generally applicable to the Continuing
Employees as of the  date of this Agreement, consult with the executive
officers listed on  _Schedule  4.1(a)_   and  provide bonus and/or other
compensation plans substantially similar to other  similarly situated
employees employed by Buyer. Buyer agrees to pay all bonus  amounts accrued
as part of the Net Working Capital of the Business to the  applicable
employees at the end of the applicable bonus period in accordance  with
historical practices of the Business.

 



 

(c) Except  for wages, bonus, vacation pay and sick pay assumed pursuant to
this Agreement,  or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall
assume no liability  for any agreements, arrangements, Employee Plans,
commitments, policies or  understandings of any kind relating to employment,
compensation or benefits  for  the present or former employees of the
Business for all employment prior to  the  Closing Date. The parties agree
that no employee shall be entitled to any third  party beneficiary status by
virtue of this Section 4.1. Nothing in this  Agreement or in Section 4.1
obligates Buyer to employ a Continuing Employee  for  any specified of
minimum period of time, and nothing therein or in this  Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on the right of Buyer to terminate  any  Continuing
Employee at will. All Continuing Employees shall be employees at  will  and
may be terminated at any time, with or without notice, and with or without 
cause.

 

 

**4.2** **_Expenses_**.  Except  as otherwise provided herein, each party
hereto shall pay its own expenses  and  costs incurred in connection with
the negotiation and consummation of this  Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer shall pay all federal,  state and local sales,
documentary and transfer taxes, if any, due as a result  of the purchase,
sale or transfer of the Acquired Assets.

 

 

**4.3** **_Disclosure  to Employees_**.  Seller  and Buyer shall mutually
agree on the timing and content of any notification  or  discussions with
Seller's employees or any other parties and/or representatives  of the
employees with respect to the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

**4.4** **_Public  Disclosure_**.  Seller  and Buyer shall not make any
public statement or release concerning this  Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby except for such information  as  shall have been
approved in writing as to form and content by the other party  hereto or as
may be required under applicable law.

 

 

**4.5** **_Third  Party Consents_**.  To the  extent that Seller's rights
under any agreement, contract, commitment, lease,  license, permit,
authorization or other Acquired Asset to be assigned to Buyer  hereunder may
not be assigned without the consent of another person which has  not been
obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign  the
same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be 
unlawful, and each of Seller and Buyer shall use their best efforts (with
each  of Seller or Buyer's, as the case may be, cooperation) to obtain any
such  required consent as promptly as possible after the Closing. If any such
consent  shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would be
ineffective or  would impair Buyer's rights under the instrument or document
in question so that  Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit of all
such rights, Seller, to  the  maximum extent permitted by law and the
instrument or document, shall act as  Buyer's agent in order to obtain for it
the benefits thereunder and shall  cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted
by law and the instrument or  document, with Buyer in any other reasonable
arrangement designed to provide  such benefits exclusively to Buyer.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

**4.6** **_Post-Closing  Financial Statement Deliveries by Seller_**. 
Within  thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller, at Buyer's sole
expense,  will cause the delivery to Buyer of the following:

ended December  31, 2006;

 



 

(b) un-audited  statements of income and statements of cash flows for the
Business for the  quarterly periods ending March 31, 2007, June 30, 2007 and
September 30, 2007;  and

 



 

(c) an  un-audited balance sheet for the Business as at September 30, 2007. 

 



 

**ARTICLE  V**

 



 

**_SURVIVAL  OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_**

 

 

**5.1** **_Indemnification  by Seller_**.  Seller  shall indemnify, hold
harmless and defend Buyer, its directors, officers,  employees, subsidiaries,
affiliates and their respective successors, permitted  assigns and heirs, as
applicable (" **Buyer  Indemnitees** ")  after  the Closing Date from and
against all Damages (as defined below in Section  5.4)  incurred or suffered
by Buyer that result from, relate to or arise out  of:

 

 

(a) any  misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of Seller under
this  Agreement;

 

 

(b) non-fulfillment  of any agreement or covenant on the part of Seller as
required under this  Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Transition
Agreement, the License Agreement  and the Mutual Non-Competition Agreement;

 

 

(c) all  Retained Liabilities of Seller;

 

 

(d) all  liabilities for the conduct of Seller's business not purchased
hereunder or  other actions of Seller occurring after the Closing Date; and

(f) fifty  percent (50%) of all Warranty Claims over and above Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars  ($200,000) of Warranty Claims (the " **First  Warranty
Claim Threshold** ").  For  purposes of clarity, Buyer shall be responsible
for all Warranty Claims up  to  and including the First Warranty Claim
Threshold and, thereafter subject to  Section 5.1(g), Buyer and Seller shall
each be responsible for fifty (50%)  of  the aggregate amount of all
Warranty Claims that exceed the First Warranty  Claim  Threshold. As used
herein, " **Warranty  Claim** " means  a  claim made against Buyer by a
purchaser of any product sold and delivered by  Seller prior to the Closing
Date for a breach of the warranty offered by Seller  for such product and
such claim fully complies with the terms of such warranty. 

 

 

(g) all  Warranty Claims in excess of the sum of the First Warranty Claim
Threshold  plus  One Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,800,000)
(the " **Second  Warranty Claim Threshold** "),  for  purposes of clarity,
the parties understand that after the equal sharing of  Warranty Claim
liability described in Section 5.1(f), Seller shall be solely  responsible
for all Warranty Claim liability exceeding the Second Warranty  Claim 
Threshold.

 

 

Buyer  shall advise Seller of any individual Warranty Claim in excess of
Fifty Thousand  Dollars ($50,000). Buyer shall report to Seller on a
quarterly basis details  as  to all outstanding Warranty Claims, including
any resolution of a Warranty  Claim  during each such quarter.

 

 

**5.2** **_Limits  on Seller 's Indemnification_**.

 

 

(a) _Time  Limitation_.  Except  as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(f),
the indemnification obligations of  Seller provided for in Sections 5.1(a),
(f) and (g) shall expire eighteen (18)  months after the Closing Date;

 

 

(b) _Basket_.  Except  as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(d), the
indemnification obligations of  Seller provided for in Section 5.1(a) shall
not require Seller to indemnify  Buyer Indemnitees for Losses incurred by
Buyer Indemnitees under Section 5.1(a)  until the aggregate amount of such
Losses exceeds Two Million Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) ("
**Basket** "),  in  which event Buyer Indemnitees may claim indemnification
to the extent that  such  Losses exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000);

 

 

(c) _Cap_.  Except  as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(e), the
indemnification obligations of  Seller provided for in Section 5.1(a) shall
not exceed in the aggregate Twenty  Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (" **Cap**
"). 

 

 

(d) _Exceptions  to Basket_.  The  Basket shall not apply to Sections 2.2
(Authority), 2.5 (Title), first sentence  only, 2.11 (Benefit Plans), 2.12
(Environmental), 2.16 (Taxes) and 2.17  (Accounts Receivable) (collectively,
the " **Primary  Representations and Warranties** ").

 

 

(e) _Exceptions  to Cap_.  The Cap  shall not apply to a breach of the
Primary Representations and  Warranties.

 

 

Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary, the Basket and Cap shall not apply
to Seller's  non-performance or non-payment of: (a) any covenant of a party
hereto to make  a  payment as required hereunder, (b) any covenant in which
Seller willfully does  not perform and (c) any brokerage fees owed by Seller
hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

(f) _Exception  to Time Limitation_.  Anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.2(a) notwithstanding, Sellers' indemnification obligations provided
for in Section 5.1(a) with respect to  a  breach of any of the
representations and warranties in Section 2.2 (Authority),  2.5 (Title),
first sentence only, 2.12 (Environmental), and 2.16 (Taxes), which  shall not
expire due to the passage of time and shall survive for the applicable 
statutes of limitation.

 

 

Except  where limited by a specific restriction on duration set forth herein,
Seller's  obligation to perform its covenants hereunder shall expire when
each such  covenant is performed. Any such obligations under this Section 5.2
for which  Buyer gives Sellers timely notice as provided in Section 5.5
within such  eighteen (18) month period shall survive until the claim is
finally resolved. 

 

 

**5.3** **_Indemnification  by Buyer_**.  Buyer  shall indemnify, hold
harmless and defend Seller, its directors, officers,  employees,
subsidiaries, affiliates and their respective successors, assigns  and 
heirs, as applicable (" **Seller  Indemnitees** ")  after  the Closing Date
from and against all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller  that result
from, relate to or arise out of:

 

 

(a) any  misrepresentation or breach of warranty on the part of Buyer under
this  Agreement;

 

 

(b) non-fulfillment  of any agreement or covenant on the part of Buyer as
required under this  Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Transition
Agreement and the License  Agreement and the Mutual Non-Competition
Agreement;

 

 

(c) the  Assumed Liabilities;

 

 

(d) all  liabilities for the conduct of Buyer's business or other actions of
Buyer  occurring after the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, all
liabilities  to Continuing Employees;

 



 

(e) any  failure of Seller to comply with any WARN Laws; and

 



 

(f) the  ownership and use of the Acquired Assets and the Business for events
occurring  after the Closing Date.

 



 

Except  where limited by a specific restriction on duration set forth herein,
Buyer's  obligation to perform its covenants hereunder shall expire when each
such  covenant is performed.

 



 

**5.4** **_Damages_**.  For the  purposes of this Article V, the term "
**Damages** " shall  (a) include any and all losses (including any claims,
judgments, damages, fines,  penalties, liabilities, costs or expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees  (collectively, the " **Damages** ")) 
actually paid or incurred by the Indemnified Party (as defined herein), (b) 
be  reduced by any amounts recovered from any surety, insurance carrier or
third  party obligor and no right of subrogation against any Indemnifying
Party shall  accrue hereunder to or for the benefit of any surety, insurance
company or  any  third party, and (c) be computed on an after-tax basis.
Each party agrees to  submit in a timely manner to any applicable surety,
insurance carrier or third  party obligor, all claims for Damages for which
such entity may have a liability  to the party claiming the right to
indemnification. The amount of the actual  loss and the amount of the
indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into  account the timing of the
loss or payment, as applicable, using the Prime Rate  as an interest rate or
discount rate, as appropriate. A party claiming indemnity  shall take all
reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim  for  which it
is seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to avoid  any
costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and expenses 
cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

 



 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

**5.5** **_Claims  for Indemnification_**.  Whenever any claim shall arise
for indemnification under this Article V, Seller  or Buyer, as the case may
be, seeking indemnification (the " **Indemnified  Party** "),  shall 
notify the party from whom indemnification is sought in writing (the "
**Indemnifying  Party** ")  of the  claim within fourteen (14) days of the
receipt of written notice of any such  claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim (an  " **Indemnification  Claim
Notice** ").  In  the event of any such claim for indemnification hereunder
resulting from or  in  connection with any claim or legal proceedings by a
third party, the  Indemnification Claim Notice shall specify, if known, the
amount or an estimate  of the amount of the liability arising therefrom and
shall append all legal  papers, notices and other documents received in
connection therewith. The  delivery of the Indemnification Claim Notice by
the Indemnified Party to the  Indemnifying Party within such fourteen (14)
day period shall not be a condition  precedent to any liability of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement,  unless such Indemnifying Party has
otherwise been prejudiced by the lack of  or  delay in delivering such
Indemnification Claim Notice. The Indemnified Party  shall not settle or
compromise any claim by a third party for which it is  entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the prior written consent of  the 
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed  if the settlement or judgment includes an unconditional release to
the  Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such claim,
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that if  suit shall have been instituted against
the Indemnified Party and the  Indemnifying Party shall not have taken
control of such suit after notification  thereof as provided in Section 5.6
hereof, the Indemnified Party shall have  the  right to settle or compromise
such claim upon giving reasonable and timely  notice to the Indemnifying
Party, as provided in Section 5.6.

 

 

**5.6** **_Defense  by the Indemnifying Party_**.  In  connection with any
claim which may give rise to indemnity hereunder resulting  from or arising
out of any claim or legal proceeding, the Indemnifying Party,  at  its sole
cost and expense may, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party,  assume
the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, whether or not under  a 
reservation of rights with respect to ultimate liability under this Article 
V.  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such claim or
legal  proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably
acceptable  to  the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claims
or legal proceedings  and at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party shall take all steps  necessary in the defense or settlement thereof.
The Indemnifying Party shall  not  consent to a settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any  such  claim or legal proceeding, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified  Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed if the  settlement or judgment includes
an unconditional release to the Indemnified  Party from all liability with
respect to such claim). If the Indemnified Party  shall withhold its consent
to an economic settlement tendered to it by the  Indemnifying Party (the
expense of which would be borne solely by the  Indemnifying Party), then the
amount of any indemnification liability of the  Indemnifying Party specific
to the claim which was the subject of the proffered  and rejected settlement
shall not exceed the amount of such proffered and  rejected settlement, plus
costs and expenses applicable to consummating such  settlement. The
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but  not  control)
the defense of any such action, with its own counsel and at its own  expense.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of any such  claim  or
litigation resulting therefrom within twenty one (21) days after the date 
of  the Indemnification Claim Notice, (a) the Indemnified Party may defend
against  such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
including,  but not limited to, settling such claim or litigation, after
giving notice  of  the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the
Indemnified Party  may  reasonably deem appropriate, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled  to  participate in (but not control)
the defense of such action, with its counsel  and at its own expense.

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

**5.7** **_Payment_**.  Upon  the determination of liability under Sections
5.1 or 5.3 hereof, the appropriate  party shall pay to the other, within ten
(10) days after such determination,  the  amount of any claim for
indemnification made hereunder and, if such payment  is  not made
thereunder, the Indemnified Party shall have set-off rights against  any 
amounts owed to the Indemnifying Party, and/or its affiliates. Upon the
payment  in full of any claim, by setoff or otherwise, the Indemnifying
Party, except  as  set forth in Section 5.5, shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Indemnified  Party against any person, firm or corporation with
respect to the subject matter  of such claim. Except for any payment due in
respect of the Final Net Working  Capital Adjustment, or for breaches of the
Escrow Agreement, Transition  Agreement or the License Agreement or the
Mutual Non-Competition Agreement,  the  indemnification provisions of this
Article V shall be the exclusive remedies  of  the parties in connection
with the purchase and sale of any Acquired Assets.  In  the event that Buyer
receives payment from Seller for Buyer's inability to  collect the Accounts
Receivable, such uncollected Accounts Receivable shall,  without further
action on the part of Buyer be assigned to Seller and in the  event that
Buyer receives any payment thereon, Buyer will immediately remit  such 
payment to Seller.

applicable, with the provisions of any  bulk  sales law including, without
limitation, the bulk transfer provisions of the  Uniform Commercial Code of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller  agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer and its officers, agents  and  employees from
any loss, cost, expenses (including related counsel fees),  liability or
damage which Buyer or its officers, agents or employees may suffer  or incur
by virtue of the noncompliance by Seller with any such bulk sales  law,
