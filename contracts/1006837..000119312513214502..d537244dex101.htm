3 ARTICLE II

at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, Two Embarcadero Center, 28th Floor,
San Francisco, California 94111, or at such other place and time as the

expressly provided herein, the Closing shall for all purposes be deemed
effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date. All documents
delivered and actions taken at the Closing shall be deemed to have been

actions are completed or waived in writing by the Party against whom such
waiver is sought to be enforced.

2.2 Closing Deliveries.

Sellers Representative, as the case may be:

deposit in the ETA Escrow Account, the ETA Escrow Amount, (C) for deposit in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (D) for
deposit in the Second Closing Escrow Account, the Second Closing Escrow
Amount.

2.3 Working Capital Adjustment.

(c) _Pre-Closing Adjustment_. For the purpose of determining the Initial
Purchase Price, no less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers Representative will cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Purchasers a statement setting forth an estimate of the Net Working Capital as
of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern local time) on the Closing Date (the " _Adjustment
Determination Effective Time_ ") disregarding the transactions contemplated
hereby (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ ") and the 

 



5  components and calculation thereof (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement_ "). The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement will (i) include
reasonable supporting documentation for the estimates and calculations
contained therein (together with any additional information reasonably
requested by the Purchasers) and (ii) be prepared by Sellers in good faith and
in accordance with the Seller Accounting Policies on a basis consistent with
that used in the preparation of the Financial Statements. A sample Estimated
Net Working Capital Statement setting forth an estimate of the Net Working
Capital as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern local time) on June 30, 2013, prepared by
Sellers in good faith and in accordance with the Seller Accounting Policies on
a basis consistent with that used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, is set forth on _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the
amounts therein shall be for illustrative purposes only). The form, line
items, calculations and computations set forth in the Estimated Net Working
Capital Statement will be consistent with those included in such
sample Estimated Net Working Capital Statement. The Purchasers and Sellers
Representative will cooperate and negotiate to resolve any dispute regarding
the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement prior to the Closing (the results
of any such resolution to be reflected on a new Estimated Net Working Capital
Statement, which the Parties agree will be considered the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement for all further purposes hereunder). To the extent
that the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement exceeds _negative_ $4,675,000 (the " _Target Net
Working Capital Amount_ "), the purchase price payable at the Closing set
forth in _Section 1.2_ will be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of the excess. To the extent that the Target Net Working Capital Amount
exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated
Net Working Capital Statement, the purchase price payable at the Closing set
forth in _Section 1.2_ will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the
amount of the excess. During such time (and, if applicable, during the
Resolution Period), without limiting  _Section 5.6_, Sellers will give the
Purchasers and their Representatives access to all records, facilities and
personnel of Sellers, the Companies and their respective Representatives as
reasonably necessary for the Purchasers and their Representatives to
undertake the review of the Estimated Net Working Capital Statement.

(d) _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement_. Within 45 calendar days
after the Closing Date, the Purchasers will cause to be prepared and delivered
to Sellers Representative a statement setting forth the Net Working Capital,
disregarding the effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, as of the
Adjustment Determination Effective Time, showing in reasonable detail the
Purchasers good faith determination, in each case as of the Adjustment
Determination Effective Time, of the actual amounts of (i) Net Working
Capital and (ii) a calculation of the Purchase Price based on such amounts.
The Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and all computations and
determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with
the Seller Accounting Policies on a basis consistent with that used in the
preparation of the Financial Statements, but, in any event, with respect to
Net Working Capital, consistent with the methodology for calculating the
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the components and calculation
thereof (the " _Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "). During such
time (and, if applicable, during the Resolution Period), without limiting
_Section 5.6_, the Purchasers will give the Sellers Representative and its
Representatives access to all

 



6  records, facilities and personnel of the Purchasers, the Companies and their
respective Representatives as reasonably necessary for the Sellers
Representative and its Representatives to undertake the review of the Post
Closing Net Working Capital Statement.

(e) _Determination of Conclusive Net Working Capital_. Sellers
Representative will have 45 calendar days following the receipt of the Post-
Closing Net Working Capital Statement to review the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital Statement. During such time, Sellers Representative may dispute any
items set forth on the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement (or specific
calculations or methods contemplated thereby) by providing written notice to
the Purchasers that (i) sets forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute, (ii) only includes disagreements based on mathematical errors or
based on Net Working Capital not being calculated in accordance with the
definition and methodologies set forth herein (including the Seller
Accounting Policies) and (iii) includes the Sellers draft of the Post-Closing
Net Working Capital Statement. Unless Sellers Representative delivers written
notice to the Purchasers of dispute thereof on or prior to the 45th calendar
day after Sellers Representatives receipt of the Post-Closing Net Working
Capital Statement, Sellers Representative will be deemed to have accepted and
agreed to the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement and such statement
(and the specific calculations or methods contemplated thereby) will be
final, binding and conclusive. If Sellers Representative notifies the
Purchasers in writing of disputed items contained in the Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement (or specific calculations or methods contemplated
thereby) (the " _Disputed Items_ ") within such 45 calendar day period, for 15
calendar days following delivery of such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
the Purchasers and Sellers Representative will attempt in good faith to
resolve their differences with respect to the Disputed Items. After the later
of such 45 calendar day period and such 15 calendar day period (if any),
Sellers Representative will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to all
items on the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement (and the specific
calculations or methods contemplated thereby) other than the Disputed Items,
and such items (and the specific calculations or methods contemplated
thereby) other than the Disputed Items will be final, binding and conclusive.
Any resolution by the Purchasers and Sellers Representative during the
Resolution Period as to any Disputed Items will be set forth in writing and
will be final, binding and conclusive. If the Purchasers and Sellers
Representative do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end of the Resolution
Period, then all Disputed Items remaining in dispute will be submitted by
either one of the Parties within ten (10) calendar days after the expiration
of the Resolution Period to a national independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Purchasers and Sellers Representative that is not an
auditor of any of the Sellers, the Purchasers or the Sponsor (the " _Neutral
Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Arbitrator will act as an arbitrator to determine
only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute as of the end of the Resolution
Period. In resolving such Disputed Items, the Neutral Arbitrator may not
assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such
Disputed Item claimed by any Party or less than the lowest value for such
Disputed Item claimed by any Party. Any associated engagement fees, costs and
expenses shall initially be borne 50% by Sellers (allocated among Sellers pro
rata based on their respective share of the Purchase Price received pursuant
to _Section 1.2_) and 50% by the Purchasers (allocated between the

 



7  Purchasers pro rata based on their respective share of the Purchase Price
paid pursuant to _Section 1.2_); _provided_ , that such fees, costs and
expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall ultimately be allocated to and borne
by the Purchasers (allocated between Purchasers on a pro rata basis) and
Sellers (allocated among Sellers on a pro rata basis) based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Neutral Arbitrators determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator with payment between the
Parties to reflect this allocation to be made within seven (7) business days
following the determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement.
For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Neutral Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of Sellers position, 60% of the costs
of the Neutral Arbitrators review would be borne by the Purchasers and 40%
of the costs would be borne by Sellers. In addition, without limiting _Section
5.6_, the Purchasers and Sellers Representative will give the Neutral
Arbitrator access to all records, facilities and personnel of such Party and
its Affiliates and Representatives as is reasonably necessary to perform its
function as arbitrator. The Purchasers and Sellers Representative will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Neutral Arbitrator to
deliver to the Purchasers and Sellers Representative a written determination
(such determination to include an explanation in reasonable detail of the
reasons for such determination and a work sheet setting forth all material
calculations and methods used in arriving at such determination) of the
Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator and the resulting effect
thereof on the Post-Closing Net Working Capital Statement within twenty (20)
calendar days of the Neutral Arbitrators receipt of such Disputed Items,
which determination will be final, binding and conclusive and upon which
judgment may be entered. The final, binding and conclusive Post-Closing Net
Working Capital Statement based either upon agreement or deemed agreement by
the Purchasers and Sellers Representative or the written determination
delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_
will be the " _Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement_."

(f) _Post Closing Adjustment_. Within seven (7) business days after the final
determination of the Net Adjustment Amount, as provided in _Section 2.3(c)_
above:

(i) if the Net Working Capital set forth on the Conclusive Net Working Capital
Statement exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the Purchasers
shall pay an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount to Sellers
Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated by Sellers Representative.

(ii) If the Net Working Capital set forth on the Conclusive Set Working
Capital Statement is more negative than the Estimated Net Working Capital
Amount, then the Purchasers and Sellers Representative shall provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release a portion of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount equal to the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount to the
Purchasers or their designee, and if the Adjustment Escrow Amount is not
sufficient to cover the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount in full,
the Purchasers may thereafter recover any remaining amount in cash directly
from the Sellers, or, at the Purchasers election in their sole 

 



8  discretion, by a joint written instruction from the Purchasers and Sellers
Representative to the Escrow Agent to release a portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount equal to such shortfall to the Purchasers or as they direct, in
any case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by the Purchasers.

All payments to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_ will be made no
later than the tenth (10th) business day following the date on which the
Purchasers and Sellers Representative agree, or are deemed to have agreed
to, or the Neutral Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Net Working Capital
Statement. In addition, any payment made pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_
shall be deemed to be, and each of Sellers Representative and the Purchasers
shall treat such payments as, an adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price for
federal, state, local and foreign income tax purposes.

 

2.4 Second Closing and Deliveries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the closing of the purchase and sale of the PTI Shares (the
" _Second Closing_ ") shall take place on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the satisfaction and/or waiver of all conditions to the
Second Closing set forth in _Section 6.5_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature have to be satisfied at Second Closing (but subject to the
satisfaction and/or waiver of those conditions)) has not occurred on or before
the Closing Date, then (a) the Second Closing shall take place as promptly as
practicable thereafter, but in no event more than four (4) business days
following the satisfaction and/or waiver of all conditions to the Second
Closing set forth in _Section 6.5_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature have to be satisfied at Second Closing (but subject to the
satisfaction and/or waiver of those conditions)), at the offices of OMelveny

material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws; (ii)

qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, so qualified and has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS (covering all required law changes) and, to
the Knowledge of the Sellers, there are no facts or circumstances that could
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or the
imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA, the Code or
any other applicable Laws; (iv) other than routine claims for benefits, no
liens, actions, investigations, examinations, claims, proceedings, lawsuits or
complaints to or by any Person or Governmental Authority have been filed

(f) There are no reserves, assets, surpluses or prepaid premiums with respect
to any Company Plan that is a "welfare plan" within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA, including any cafeteria plan balances, flexible spending

Company Plan in accordance with its terms and conditions and all Laws is in
possession of the Companies or its Subsidiaries and such data is complete,
correct, and in a form which is sufficient for the proper administration of

in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to any Company Plan has
engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code involving such Company Plan which,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to subject the
Company to a tax or

 



25  penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 501, 502 or 510 of
ERISA. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no fiduciary has any liability for
breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply with the
requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws in connection
with the administration or investment of the assets of any Company Plan.

 

(i) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) or premium payments required to have been
made under the terms of any Company Plan, or in accordance with applicable
Law, as of the date hereof have in all material respects been timely made or
reflected on the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In
all material respects, all liabilities or expenses of the Company in respect
of any Company Plan (including workers compensation) which have not been paid,
have been properly accrued on the Companys most recent financial statements
in compliance with GAAP and all amounts due or accrued due for all salary,
wages, bonuses, commissions, vacation with pay, sick days and benefits under
the Company Plans have either been paid or are accurately reflected in the
books and records of the applicable Company or Subsidiary.

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event (which would not in
and of itself trigger such payment or benefit): (i) entitle any current or
former employee, officer, director, leased employee, consultant or agent (or
their respective beneficiaries) of any Company to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment under any Company Plan, (ii) (A) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, (B) trigger any payment or funding, through a

benefits due under any Company Plan, or (D) trigger any other obligation
pursuant to any Company Plan, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Company Plan, (iv) result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction within the meaning of section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, or (v) result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or
in combination with any other payment, constitute an "excess parachute
payment," as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(k) No current or former officer, director, employee, leased employee,
consultant or agent (or their respective beneficiaries) has or will obtain a
right to receive a gross-up payment from the Company with respect to any
excise, additional income or penalty taxes that may be imposed upon such
individual pursuant to Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code or otherwise.

(l) The Company may amend or terminate any Company Plan (other than an
employment agreement or any similar agreement that cannot be terminated
without the consent of the other party) at any time without incurring
liability thereunder, other than in respect of accrued and vested obligations
and medical or welfare claims incurred prior to such amendment or termination,
ordinary administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event, or
such liability as imposed upon such a termination under the express
provisions of such plan.

 



26 (m) With respect to each Company Plan that is subject to the Laws or
applicable customs or rules of relevant jurisdictions other than the United
States or Canada (each, a " _Foreign Plan_ "): (i) each Foreign Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of Law and
regulations regarding employee benefits, mandatory contributions and
retirement plans of each jurisdiction in which each such Foreign Plan is
maintained, to the extent those Laws are applicable to such Foreign Plan; (ii)
each Foreign Plan has been administered at all times and in all material
respects in accordance with its terms; (iii) there are no pending
investigations by any Governmental Authority involving any Foreign Plan, and
no pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of the Foreign Plans), suits or proceedings against any
Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Foreign
Plan; (iv) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by themselves or
in conjunction with any other transactions, will not create or otherwise
result in any material liability, accelerated payment or any enhanced benefits
with respect to any Foreign Plan; and (v) all liabilities with respect to each
Foreign Plan have been funded in accordance with the terms of such Foreign
Plan and have been properly reflected in the financial statements of the
Company. The Company has satisfied all obligations under applicable law with
respect to any plan or program maintained or sponsored by a Governmental
Authority.

(n) All amounts due or accrued for all salary, wages, bonuses, commissions,
vacation with pay, sick days and benefits under the Company Plans have either
been paid or are accurately reflected in the books and records of the
applicable Company or Subsidiary thereof.

formation and has all requisite limited liability company power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign Person in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or

 



35  conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing,
or to have such power or authority, would not have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect. Each Purchaser has made available to the Sellers prior to the
date of this Agreement true and complete copies of its certificate or articles
of incorporation and its bylaws, in each case, including any amendments
through the date hereof. Each Purchaser is not in violation of its certificate

execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by each
Purchaser of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by each Purchaser,
and no other proceedings on the part of each Purchaser are necessary
to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by each Purchaser of
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Purchaser, and,
assuming due authorization and delivery by the Sellers, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each Purchaser, enforceable
against each Purchaser in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

4.3 No Conflict; Required Filings.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by each Purchaser of this
Agreement and the consummation by each Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict
with the charter or governing documents of each Purchaser, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referenced in _Section 4.3(b)_, contravene or
conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any Law binding
upon or applicable to each Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective properties or assets or (iii) result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any loan, guarantee of
indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease,
agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or
license binding upon each Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or result in
the creation of any Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) upon any
of the properties or assets of each Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, other
than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such contravention, conflict,
violation, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, loss or
Encumbrance that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No material consent of, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
with, any Person (including any Governmental Authority) is required to be 

 



36  obtained or made by each Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than (i) the FCC
Approvals, (ii) the State PUC Approvals, (iii) the Non-U.S. Telecommunications

result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) To the Knowledge of each Purchaser, each Purchaser is legally,
financially, and otherwise qualified to acquire control of the Permits that
are issued by the FCC, any State PUCs, or Non-U.S. Telecommunications Agency,
or any other Governmental Authority under applicable Law, including the
Communications Act, rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, state
Law applicable to providers of telecommunications services, rules regulations
and policies of the State PUCs, non-U.S. laws applicable to providers of
telecommunications services, and rules, regulations and policies of Non-U.S.
Telecommunications Agencies (collectively, the " _Communications Laws_ "). To
the Knowledge of each Purchaser, there are no facts that would under existing
Communications Laws disqualify each Purchaser as transferee of the Permits.
There are no pending matters, or to the Knowledge of each Purchaser,
threatened matters, related to each Purchaser or its qualifications that would
reasonably be expected to result in a denial or delay in obtaining FCC
Approvals, State PUC Approvals and/or the Non-U.S. Telecommunications
Approvals for the acquisition of control of the Permits.

4.4 Legal Proceedings. As of the date hereof, there are no Actions or
investigations pending against or, to the Knowledge of each Purchaser,
threatened against, each Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective properties or assets by or before any Governmental Authority that
would reasonably be expected to result in a material and adverse effect on
each Purchasers ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.5 Financing; Limited Guarantee.

(a) The Purchasers have provided the Sellers with true, accurate and complete
copies of (i) an executed equity commitment letter from York Special
Opportunities Fund, LP (the " _Sponsor_ ") to provide equity financing to the
Purchasers equal to amounts described therein (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ "), (ii) an executed commitment letter for mezzanine debt and equity
(the " _Manulife Commitment Letter_ ") from the Manufacturers Life Insurance
Company ("Manulife"), and (iii) an executed debt commitment letter and
related fee letter and term sheet (the " _Senior Debt Commitment Letter_ " and
together with the Manulife Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment
Letter, the " _Financing Commitments_ ") from the Bank of Montreal, HSBC Bank
Canada and ATB Corporate Financial Services (the "Senior Lenders" and together
with Manulife, the " _Lenders_ ") pursuant to which, and subject to the terms
and conditions

 



37  of which, the Senior Lenders have committed to provide the Purchasers with
loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which may be used to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with the
equity financing pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and the mezzanine
debt and equity financing pursuant to the Manulife Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that Parent and the
Sellers are express third party beneficiaries thereof, with the right to
enforce such Equity Commitment Letter on the terms described therein. Each of
the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
Purchaser (or its Affiliate, if applicable) and, to the Knowledge of
Purchasers, the other parties thereto. Each of the Financing Commitments is in
full force and effect, and none of the Financing Commitments has been
withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any
respect, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated. No Purchaser
or any of their Affiliates is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set
forth in any of the Financing Commitments, and no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set
forth therein. As of the date hereof, no Purchaser is aware of any fact or
occurrence existing on the date hereof that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to (A) make any of the assumptions
or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments inaccurate,
(B) result in any of the conditions in the Financing Commitments not being
satisfied, (C) cause any of the Financing Commitments to be ineffective or (D)
otherwise result in the Financing not being available on a timely basis in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, neither the Sponsor nor any Lender has notified any Purchaser of
its intention to terminate any of the Financing Commitments or not to provide
the Financing. The net proceeds from the Financing will be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay any fees
and expenses of or payable by the Purchasers in connection therewith. The
Purchasers have paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by
the Financing Commitments that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay,
after the date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become due.
Except for the Financing Commitments, there are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements or arrangements relating to the Financing
to which any Purchaser or any of its Affiliates are a party. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of
the full amount of the Financing or the conditions precedent thereto, other
than as set forth in the Financing Commitments (the " _Disclosed Conditions_
"). No Person has any right to impose, and none of the Sponsor, any Lender or
any Purchaser has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to such
funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any
term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date). No
Purchaser has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the
Financing, or that the Financing will not be available to the Purchasers on
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement for the Purchasers to obtain the Financing or
any alternative financing.

 



38 (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Purchasers have
delivered to the Sellers the Limited Guarantee. The Limited Guarantee is in
full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Sponsor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and has not been
amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on
the part of the Sponsor under the Limited Guarantee.

4.6 Investment Intention; Investor Qualification.

(a) Each Purchaser is acquiring the Equity Interests (or any portion thereof)
as principal and not as agent and is acquiring such Equity Interests for
investment and not with a view towards distributing all or a portion thereof
in any transaction that would constitute a "distribution" within the meaning
of the Securities Act. Each Purchaser acknowledges that such Equity Interests
have not been registered under the Securities Act and neither the Sellers nor
the Companies is under any obligation to file a registration statement or
similar filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ "),
any state agency or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the
Equity Interests. Each Purchaser understands that there is no existing public
or other market for such Equity Interests and there can be no assurance that
each Purchaser will be able to sell or dispose of such Equity Interests.

(b) Each Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the risks and merits associated with
the acquisition of the Equity Interests and is acquiring the Equity Interests
(or any portion thereof) for its own account for investment, with no present
intention of making a public distribution thereof. Each Purchaser will not
sell or otherwise dispose of such Equity Interests in violation of the
Securities Act or any other applicable local, state or foreign securities
Laws.

4.7 Finders Fee. Neither the Sellers nor the Companies nor any of their
respective stockholders, members, option holders, directors, managers,
officers or Affiliates will incur any liability to any party for any brokerage
or finders fee or agents commission, or the like, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of the Purchasers or their Affiliates.

4.8 No Additional Representations.

(a) Each Purchaser acknowledges that it and its Representatives (i) have
received access to such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts
and other assets of the Sellers, the Companies and their Subsidiaries which it
and its Representatives have desired or requested to review, (ii) have had

regarding the Business.

 



39 (b) Each Purchaser acknowledges that none of the Sellers, the Companies, their
Subsidiaries nor any Person has made any representation or warranty, express
or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Companies, their Subsidiaries or the Business Made Available to the
Purchaser and its Representatives except as expressly set forth in _Article
III_ (which includes and is subject to the Disclosure Schedules), and none of
the Sellers, the Companies, their Subsidiaries nor any other Person shall be
subject to any liability to or obligation to indemnify any Purchaser
resulting from the Sellers or the Companies making available to any
Purchaser or any Purchasers use of such information, or any information,
documents or material Made Available to any Purchaser in the due diligence
materials provided to any Purchaser, including in the "data site" maintained
by the Sellers for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other
form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing described in this _Section 4.8(b)_ shall
limit any rights to indemnification in respect of the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article III_ as such indemnification is
provided for in _Article IX_. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Sellers makes any representation or warranty to any Purchaser with respect to
any financial projections or forecasts relating to the Companies, their
Subsidiaries or the Business, whether or not included in any management
presentation.

4.9 Proxy Statement; Other Information. None of the information provided by or
on behalf of each Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy
Statement will, at the time provided by or on behalf of the Purchasers or
their Subsidiaries, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns or, since July 1, 2009 has beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, any shares of Parent Common Stock or other
securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which each Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity interests of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

4.11 Contracts. There are no Contracts, and, unless approved in advance by the
Special Committee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), at the Closing there will not be any Contracts, between
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
director, officer or employee of Parent, Sellers, the Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

5.2 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Sellers and the Purchasers, subject to _Section 5.3_, shall use its
reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable Law)
to take promptly, or cause to be taken (including by their respective
Affiliates), all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action by, any Governmental Authority, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
(iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Sellers, the

 



44  Companies or any of their Subsidiaries be required to pay any fee, penalty
or other consideration in excess of $50,000 to any third party for any consent
or approval required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under any Contract, nor shall the Sellers, the Companies nor
any of their Subsidiaries be required to materially modify any Contract,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers and the Purchasers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) as promptly as practicable
make the necessary applications, requests, notices and other filings,
including filings pursuant to the HSR Act, if applicable, and thereafter
timely make all other filings and notifications, required to obtain or
maintain all FCC Approvals, State PUC Approvals, the Non-U.S.
Telecommunications Approvals, and, if applicable, the CFIUS Clearance, the
Competition Act Approval, and the ICA Clearances, (ii) use their respective
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Authorities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) promptly providing each other
with all information necessary for the preparation of such filings on a timely
basis, and (C) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such
consents, permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) use their respective
reasonable best efforts if commercially practicable to take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking all such further
actions as may be necessary to resolve such objections and/or inquiries, if
any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement
authorities, competition authorities, national security authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction, the FCC, the State PUCs, Non-U.S.
Telecommunications Agencies, CFIUS, the Canadian Competition Bureau, Industry
Canada, or any other Person may assert under any Regulatory Law with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, and (iv) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Authority, keep each other apprised of the
status of and cooperate with each other with respect to matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by the Sellers, the Companies, or the Purchasers, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority with respect to such transactions.

(c) In connection with seeking the foregoing approvals, none of the
Purchasers or Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall be required to, and
Sellers may not, without the prior written consent of the Purchasers, become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action,
other than as expressly contemplated in this Agreement, with respect to, any
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,

 



45  agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Purchasers, Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates in any
manner, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, or otherwise change the assets,
business, or portion of business of the Purchasers, Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates in any manner, or (ii) impose any restriction,
requirement or limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the
business of the Purchasers, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates in
any manner.

 

(d) Each of the Sellers and the Purchasers shall permit counsel for the other
Party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Authority (including the Proxy Statement).
Each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and each of the Purchasers, on the
other hand, agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to
attend and participate. Upon receipt of prior notice thereof, each of the
Sellers and the Purchasers shall ensure that its appropriate officers and
employees shall be available to attend, as the Sellers, the Purchasers or the
applicable Governmental Authority may request, any scheduled hearings or
meetings in connection with obtaining any FCC Approvals, State PUC Approvals,
the Non-U.S. Telecommunications Approvals, the CFIUS Clearance, the
Competition Act Approval, and/or the ICA Clearances. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this _Section 5.2_, materials provided to the other Party
or its outside counsel may be redacted to remove any estimate of the
valuation of the Companies and their Subsidiaries or the Business, or the
identities of other potential acquirers. The Parties shall take reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.2_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Sellers and the
Purchasers shall cooperate in all respects with the other and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If there are
any petitions for reconsideration, appeals or similar filings made seeking to
overturn the grant of any Company Approval, or if the FCC, any State PUC
and/or any Non-U.S. Telecommunications Agency seeks to reconsider such grant
on its own motion, then the Parties shall each use commercially reasonable
efforts to defend the applicable grants against such actions. If at any point
during the CFIUS review process, CFIUS offers the Parties an opportunity to
withdraw and resubmit their joint notice, and either Party opts to

 



46  request withdrawal and resubmission in response to such offer by CFIUS, then
the other Party shall agree to join the request for withdrawal and
resubmission at the end of the first initial 30-day review.

(f) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, no Party shall, and no
Party shall cause its Affiliates to, take any action (including any
acquisition of businesses or assets) which would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement due to the actions of any Governmental Authority. 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means all federal,
state, local or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws that are designed to (i)
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening competition through merger
or acquisition, (ii) protect the national security or the national economy of
any nation or (iii) regulate the telecommunications industry in any nation
(including the Communications Act).

 

5.3 Financing.

(a) Each Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (as
applicable), to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including
using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the
Financing Commitments, (ii) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments,
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing Commitments on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Purchasers than those contained in the Financing Commitments, (iv) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions applicable to the Purchasers contained in
the Financing Commitments (or any conditions applicable to the Purchasers
which are required to be satisfied at or prior to Closing contained in any
definitive agreements related thereto), including the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the
Financing, (v) enforce all of its rights under the Financing Commitments (or
any conditions applicable to the Purchasers which are required to be satisfied
at or prior to Closing contained in any definitive agreements related
thereto) and (vi) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it
being understood that it is not a condition to the Closing under this
Agreement, nor to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, for the Purchasers to obtain the Financing or any alternative
financing). The Purchasers shall keep the Sellers informed on a reasonable
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of their efforts to arrange the
Financing (including, upon request, providing the Sellers with copies of all
definitive agreements and other documents related to the Financing). The
Purchasers shall give the Sellers prompt notice upon becoming aware of any
breach by any party of any of the Financing Commitments or any termination of
any of the Financing Commitments. From the date hereof until the Closing, the
Purchasers shall not, without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend,
modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Financing Commitments (or any of the conditions or
contingencies to

 



47  funding contained in any of the definitive agreements related thereto) or
any other provision of, or remedies under, the Financing Commitments (or any
definitive agreements related thereto), in each case, to the extent such
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver could reasonably be expected to
have the effect of (A) adversely affecting the ability of any Purchaser to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions or contingencies
to funding contained in the Financing Commitments (or any of the conditions or
contingencies to funding contained in any of the definitive
agreements related thereto) in a manner materially adverse to the Sellers. In
the event all conditions applicable to the Senior Debt Commitment Letter or
the Manulife Commitment Letter have been satisfied, the Purchasers shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable Lender(s) to
fund the debt and equity financing pursuant to the Senior Debt Commitment
Letter and the Manulife Commitment Letter required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by Purchasers taking
enforcement action against the applicable Lender(s) to cause such Lender(s) to
fund such financing). In the event that any portion of the debt and equity
financing pursuant to the Senior Debt Commitment Letter or the
Manulife Commitment Letter becomes unavailable, the Purchasers shall notify
the Sellers and use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange
alternative financing from the same or other sources on terms and conditions
not materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Purchasers than those
contained in the Senior Debt Commitment Letter or the Manulife Commitment
Letter (as applicable) as of the date hereof (as may be amended, supplemented
or modified with the consent of the Sellers), and in an amount sufficient to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms
and conditions set forth herein; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 5.3(a) shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best
efforts of the Purchasers be deemed or construed to require, the Purchasers to
(x) incur the debt and equity financing pursuant to the Senior Debt Commitment
Letter and the Manulife Commitment Letter on terms materially less favorable
than the "market flex" provisions contained in the Senior Debt Commitment
Letter and the Manulife Commitment Letter (or any related fee letter) as of
the date hereof (as may be amended, supplemented or modified with the
consent of the Sellers), or (b) pay any fees or other compensation in any
form materially in excess of those contemplated by the Senior Debt Commitment
Letter and the Manulife Commitment Letter or any related fee letter (whether
to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise) as of the
date hereof (as may be amended, supplemented or modified with the consent of
the Sellers). In such event, (1) the term "Financing" as used in this
Agreement will be deemed to include any such alternative financing, and (2)
the term "Financing Commitments" will be deemed to include any commitment
letters with respect to any such alternative financing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein and for the avoidance of doubt, each
Purchaser acknowledges that it shall not be a condition to the Closing that
the Purchasers receive the Financing or any alternative financing.

(b) The Sellers will, and will cause their Subsidiaries to, at the Purchasers
sole expense (except with respect to _clause_ (v) below), cooperate reasonably
with the Purchasers and their authorized representatives in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing, including (i) participating in a reasonable
number of

 



48  meetings on reasonable advance notice, (ii) furnishing information
(including financial statements) reasonably required to be included in the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses
and similar documents, (iii) cooperation in respect of the preparation of any
underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents and other
definitive financing documents; provided, that the Companies shall not be
required to become subject to any obligations with respect to such agreements
or documents prior to the Closing, (iv) taking such reasonable actions as may
be required to facilitate the pledge of collateral to secure the Financing
(including cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness
and the release of Liens related thereto), (v) obtaining all waivers, consents
and approvals from other parties to Contracts and Encumbrances to which
the Companies or their Subsidiaries are party to or by which any of them or
their assets or properties are bound or subject, and (vi) taking all other
actions reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Financing. Any
information provided by the Sellers to the Purchasers pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(b)_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Each
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers, the Companies and their
respective Affiliates and representatives shall not have any responsibility
for, or incur any liability to any Person under or in connection with, the
arrangement of the Financing or any alternative financing that the Purchasers
may raise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that the Purchasers shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers, the Companies and their respective Affiliates and
representatives from and against any and all losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or any alternative
financing and any information utilized in connection therewith.

5.4 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

(a) Each of the Purchasers acknowledges that the information made available
to it by the Sellers and their respective Affiliates (or their respective
agents or representatives) is subject to the terms of that certain
Confidentiality and Standstill Agreement, dated as of September 18, 2012, by
and between York Special Opportunities Fund, L.P. and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate with respect to "Evaluation Material" (as defined in
the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the Companies, their Subsidiaries
and/or the Business and no party thereto (nor any of their respective
successors in interest) shall have any further rights, duties, liabilities or
obligations of any nature whatsoever with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each of the Purchasers hereby further acknowledges and
agrees that its confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations in the
Confidentiality Agreement will terminate only with respect to such "Evaluation
Material" relating to the Companies, their Subsidiaries and/or the Business
and that any and all other "Evaluation Material" provided or made available
to it by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates (or their respective
agents or representatives) concerning the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates (other than the Companies, their Subsidiaries and/or the Business)
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms to the
extent not modified by this _Section 5.4(a)_. 

(b) Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Sellers shall, subject to
compliance with applicable Laws and any Contracts to which the Sellers or any
of their respective Affiliates (including the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) is a party, provide the Purchasers access and the opportunity to
make such investigation of the management, employees, properties,
businesses and operations of the Companies and their Subsidiaries, and such
examination of the books, records and financial condition of the Companies and
their Subsidiaries, as they reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to disclose
to the Purchasers or any agent or Representative of the Purchasers any
information if they believe in good faith (after consultation with
knowledgeable counsel) that doing so could result in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the attorney-client and
work product privileges) or such disclosure would violate any applicable Law
or contractual requirement. Any such investigation and examination will be
conducted under reasonable circumstances after appropriate advance notice and
in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
Business. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4(b) shall affect any
representation or warranty of any of the Sellers in this Agreement or any
condition to the obligations of either Purchaser hereunder.

 



49 5.5 Public Announcements. The Sellers and the Purchasers agree to issue a
joint press release announcing this Agreement. The Sellers and the Purchasers
will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the
issuance of such press release or other public statement or comment relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press release or other public statement or comment prior to such
consultation except, in each case, as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or requirement of, the New
York Stock Exchange, in the case of the Sellers or their respective
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) without the prior consent of
the Purchasers, the Sellers may, and may cause the Companies and/or their
Subsidiaries to, (a) communicate with customers, vendors, suppliers, financial
analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner consistent with
past practice and not inconsistent in any respect with any press release or
public announcement made in accordance with to this _Section 5.5_ and (b)
disseminate the information included in a press release or other document
previously approved for external distribution by the Purchasers and (B)
without the prior consent of the Sellers, the Purchasers may communicate on a
non-public and confidential basis with their respective shareholders and such
shareholders respective limited partners and prospective limited partners
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.6 Books and Records.

(a) The Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Purchasers at Closing all properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating to the Business that are not
then in the possession or control of the Companies and/or their Subsidiaries.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in no event later
than twenty (20) business

 



50  days following the Closing, the Sellers will deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to the Purchasers any remaining properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the Business that
are not already in the possession or control of the Companies and/or their
Subsidiaries (it being understood that location of such properties, books,
records, Contracts, information and documents on the premises of the
Companies shall be deemed delivery).

(b) Subject to _Section 7.2(a)_ (relating to the preservation of Tax
records), the Sellers and the Purchasers agree that each of them will
preserve and keep the books of accounts, financial and other records held by
it relating to the Business (including accountants work papers) for a period
of six (6) years from the Closing Date in accordance with their respective
corporate records retention policies. The Sellers and the Purchasers shall
make such records, other information relating to the Business, employees and
auditors available to the other as may be reasonably required by such party
(i) in connection with, among other things, any audit or investigation of,
insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, disputes involving or
governmental investigations of the Sellers or the Purchasers or any of their
respective Affiliates, (ii) in order to enable the Sellers or the Purchasers
to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby
or (iii) for any other reasonable business purpose relating to the Sellers,
the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates.

5.7 Further Action. From time to time after the Closing Date, and for no
further consideration, each of the Sellers and the Purchasers shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver such
assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions and other documents and
instruments and take such other actions as may reasonably be necessary to
appropriately consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including (a)
transferring back to the Sellers or their respective designated Affiliates any
asset or liability which was inadvertently transferred to, or held by, the
Companies or their Subsidiaries at the Closing, (b) transferring to
the Purchasers any asset or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be
transferred to the Purchasers and which was not so transferred at the Closing,
(c) remitting promptly to the Sellers any cash amounts actually received by
any Purchaser in respect of any business of the Sellers other than the
Business after the Closing Date, (d) remitting promptly to the Purchasers any
cash amounts actually received by any Seller or their respective Subsidiaries
in respect of the Business after the Closing Date, (e) promptly delivering to
the Sellers or the Purchasers, as the case may be, any mail or other
communication received by the Sellers after the Closing Date pertaining to the
Business, or by the Purchasers in respect of any business of the Sellers
other than the Business, and (f) referring all inquiries with respect to the
Business to the Purchasers, in the case of the Sellers, and referring all
inquiries with respect to any business of the Sellers, in the case of the
Purchasers.

5.8 Expenses. Except as set forth in _Sections 8.3_ and _8.4_ , whether or not
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be paid by the Party incurring or
required to incur such expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that all fees
(other than legal fees of Parent or the Sellers)

 



51  paid in respect of any filings or submissions relating to the FCC Approvals,
the State PUC Approvals, the Non-U.S. Telecommunications Approvals, the CFIUS
Clearance, the Competition Act Approval, the ICA Clearances, or other
regulatory and/or antitrust filings shall be borne by the Purchasers. For the
avoidance of doubt, all costs and expenses (other than legal fees of the
Purchasers) incurred in connection with the Restructuring Transactions and
with the printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement (including
applicable SEC filing fees) shall be borne by the Sellers.

5.9 Notice of Developments. Each Party shall give prompt written notice to the
other Party of any statement or information contained in such Partys
representations and warranties (or any corresponding Disclosure Schedule)
that is incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect. During the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Sellers shall be
entitled to update the Disclosure Schedule to the extent information
contained therein or any representation or warranty of any Seller becomes
untrue or incomplete or inaccurate after the date hereof due to events or
circumstances occurring after the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchasers shall not be required to close the transactions contemplated
hereby if a reasonable acquirer of the Companies who has knowledge of the
Companies and their respective Subsidiaries would determine that the facts or
circumstances listed in such updates to the Disclosure Schedule would make:
(i) any Seller Fundamental Representation (other than the representations and
warranties of each of the Sellers set forth in _Section 3.4(c)_) untrue or
incomplete or inaccurate in all but _de minimis_ respects, or (ii) any other
representations and warranties of the Sellers untrue or incomplete or
inaccurate in all respects without giving effect to the words "materiality" or
"material" or to any qualifications based on such terms or based on the
defined term "Material Adverse Effect", except for such failures to be true,
complete or accurate which, individually or in the aggregate, would result in
a Material Adverse Effect. If the Closing occurs, any such update shall be
deemed to have amended the Disclosure Schedule, to have qualified the relevant
representations and warranties contained in Article III and to have cured any
breach of representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed
hereunder by reason of such event or circumstance. Nothing in this Agreement,
including this _Section 5.9_, shall be interpreted or construed to imply that
any Seller is making any representation or warranty as of any date other than
as otherwise set forth herein.

5.10 Intercompany Accounts. No later than the Closing Date, subject to the
Purchasers prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the Sellers shall terminate or cancel any and all intercompany
accounts and Contracts (excluding ordinary course arms length trade payables
and receivables) between the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
(other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Companies and their Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

 

5.11 Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Each of the Purchasers agrees that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of each
Person who is now or has been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior
to the Closing, a

 



52  director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent, as the case may be, of any
of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Individual_ ") as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation
or by-laws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive
the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six
(6) years from the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall cause the certificates
of incorporation and by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnified Individuals with respect to exculpation, limitation
of liabilities and indemnification than are set forth in the certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organizational documents of the Companies
and their Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Closing, and shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person who is now or has
been prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Closing, a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any action or proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such action or proceeding or resolution of such claim.

(b) At the Sellers sole option and expense, prior to the Closing, the
Sellers may cause the Companies or their Subsidiaries to purchase a six-year
prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially
equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the
Companies and their Subsidiaries (or their Affiliates) with respect to matters
arising on or before the Closing, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If such "tail" prepaid policy
has been obtained prior to the Closing, the Purchasers shall cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Companies and their Subsidiaries.

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Individual hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Individual may
have under the certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other
organizational documents of the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries, any
other indemnification agreement or arrangement or otherwise. The provisions
of this _Section 5.11_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and expressly are intended to benefit, and are
specifically enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals.

(d) In the event either Purchaser or its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of such Purchaser shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.11_.

 

5.12 Waiver of Conflicts and Attorney-Client Privilege. Each of the Purchasers
hereby waives, on its own behalf, and agrees to cause the Companies and their

 



53  Subsidiaries to waive, (a) any conflicts that may arise in connection with
any legal counsel that represents the Sellers or the Companies or their
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement (the " _Current
Representation_ ") undertaking after the Closing the representation of any
current officer, director, employee, manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate
of the Companies or their Subsidiaries (a " _Post-Closing Representation_ ")
and (b) their rights of attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between such counsel and any such officer, director, employee,
manager, member, stockholder or Affiliate occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with such Purchaser on or following the Closing.

 

5.13 Transaction Bonuses. Any payment that is or becomes due and payable to
any current or former employee, officer, director, leased employee,
consultant or agent (or their respective beneficiaries) of any Company
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, each of the individuals listed in
_Section 3.12(j)_ of the Disclosure Schedule) in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
paid by the Sellers at the Closing out of the Initial Purchase Price.

5.14 No Solicitation.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this  _Section 5.14_, promptly following
its execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and each of the Sellers
and Companies and their Subsidiaries shall cease and cause to be terminated
any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any
Alternative Proposal, and Parent shall deliver a written notice to each such
Person to the effect that Parent is ending all discussions and negotiations
with such Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal, effective on
and from the date of this Agreement. Such notice shall also request such
Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, including the Sellers and the Companies and
their Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 5.14_, during
the period commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the earlier to
occur of the Closing and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Parent and its Subsidiaries shall
not, and shall use its and their reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their respective representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the making,
submission or announcement of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) furnish to any
Person (other than the Purchasers or their respective designees) any non-
public information relating to Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, or afford
to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or
other non-public information, or to any personnel, of Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Purchasers or their respective designees), in any
such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement
of, or to encourage, facilitate or assist, an Alternative Proposal or any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that could lead to an Alternative
Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions regarding any Alternative Proposal with
any Person that has made or, to Parents Knowledge, is considering making, an
Alternative Proposal, except to notify such Person as to the existence of the
provisions of this _Section 5.14_, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend an
Alternative Proposal, or (v) cause or permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into

 



54  or to modify or amend (other than to terminate) any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
") relating to any Alternative Proposal (other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.14_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, at all times prior to the Closing, Parent
(acting under the direction of the Special Committee) may, directly or
indirectly through one or more Affiliates or Representatives, participate or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-
public information relating to Parent and/or its Subsidiaries to, and/or
afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other
non-public information, or to the personnel, of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to ( _provided_ , that
Parent shall promptly make available to the Purchasers any material non-public
information concerning Parent and/or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously Made Available to the
Purchasers) any Person (and/or its Affiliates or Representatives) that has
made or delivered to Parent an Alternative Proposal that was not solicited in
breach of _Section 5.14(a)_; _provided_ , that the Special Committee shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel) that such Alternative Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Special Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent shall be permitted, to
the extent it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, to
modify, waive, amend or release any existing standstill obligations owed by
any Person to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. The Sellers will as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 48 hours of receipt of such
Alternative Proposal or inquiry), notify the Purchasers in writing of the
receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, specifying
the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the Person
making such Alternative Proposal or inquiry, and the Sellers will,
as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 48 hours of
receipt of such Alternative Proposal or inquiry), provide to the Purchasers a
copy of all written proposals provided to the Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with any such Alternative Proposal or inquiry. The
Sellers will, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within
48 hours of receipt of such Alternative Proposal or inquiry), notify the
Purchasers in writing of any material modifications to the financial or other
material terms of such Alternative Proposal or inquiry and will, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 48 hours of receipt of such
Alternative Proposal or inquiry), provide to the Purchasers a copy of all
written proposals subsequently provided to or by the Sellers or any of their
Subsidiaries in connection with any such Alternative Proposal or inquiry.

 

(c) Except as provided by _Section 5.14(d)_, at any time after the execution
of this Agreement, neither the Special Committee nor the Board of Directors
of Parent shall resolve to withdraw, modify or qualify and/or withdraw, modify
or qualify the Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Purchasers (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ").

 



55 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Parent Meeting, (x) if Parent is then in receipt of a
written Alternative Proposal from any Person that is not withdrawn and that
the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Special Committee or the Board
of Directors of Parent may (1) effect a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with _Section 8.1(g)_, and/or (2) authorize Parent to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_ to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, or (y) in
response to an Intervening Event, the Special Committee or the Board of the
Directors of Parent may effect a Change of Recommendation, if and only if:

(i) in the case of clauses (x) and (y) above, (A) Parent shall have provided
prior written notice to the Purchasers at least three (3) days in advance (the
" _Notice Period_ "), to the effect that absent any revision to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Special Committee or the Board of Directors
of Parent has resolved to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_, which notice shall
specify the basis for such Change of Recommendation and/or termination,
including in the case of clause (x) above the identity of the Person making
the Superior Proposal and the material terms thereof, it being understood and
agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of such
Alternative Proposal will require an additional prior written notice to the
Purchasers and a new three (3) day period; and (B) prior to effecting such
Change of Recommendation and/or termination, Parent shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with the
Purchasers and their Representatives in good faith (to the extent the
Purchasers desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the Special Committee or the Board of
Directors of Parent would not effect a Change of Recommendation and/or
terminate this Agreement;

(ii) in the case of clause (x) above, Parent shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.14_ with
respect to such Superior Proposal including not having materially breached the
provisions of _Sections 5.14(a)_ and _(b)_ ; and

 

(iii) in the case of clause (x)(2) above, Parent shall have validly terminated
this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 8.1(e)_, including the payment
of the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3_.

(e) Parent agrees that it will, upon request of the Purchasers, keep the
Purchasers reasonably informed regarding the matters contemplated by this
_Section 5.14_ (including any Alternative Proposals).

 



56 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent, the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, from (i) taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing
a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties or would constitute a violation of
applicable Law. It is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement (including _Article VIII_ ), a factually accurate public statement
by Parent that describes Parents receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of
Parent, shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation or an approval
or recommendation with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(g) Other than with respect to the Financing Commitments, neither the
Purchasers nor any of their respective Affiliates shall make or enter into any
formal or informal arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding)
with any Person, or have any discussions or other communications with any
other Person, in any such case with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "
shall mean a customary confidentiality agreement, which need not contain a
standstill provision.

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction. " _Acquisition Proposal_ "
shall mean any proposal, inquiry or offer, including any proposal, inquiry
or offer from or to Parents stockholders, made by any Person or group (as
defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Purchasers, their
respective Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates relating to,
whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, and
whether directly or indirectly, any purchase of the Equity Interests or any
sale of the assets of the Companies.

(j) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " shall mean any
proposal, inquiry or offer, including any proposal, inquiry or offer from or
to Parents stockholders, made by any Person or group (as defined under Rule
13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Purchasers, their respective
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective Affiliates relating to, whether in
a single transaction or series of related transactions, and whether directly
or indirectly, any (i) merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, joint venture, partnership, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving Parent and/or
any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of Parent whose business or businesses
constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets, revenues or
earnings of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) acquisition of
assets of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries

 



57  equal to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries or to which twenty-five percent (25%) or more of
Parents revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable or
(iii) acquisition of beneficial ownership (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the
Exchange Act) of (x) the Equity Interests or (y) equity interests representing
a twenty-five percent (25%) or greater economic or voting interest in Parent

Person or group (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially
owning equity interests representing a twenty-five percent (25%) or greater
economic or voting interest in Parent.

(k) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction made by any Person on terms
that the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of Parent determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel), considering such factors as the Special Committee or the Board of
Directors of Parent considers to be appropriate (including the conditionality,
timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal), are more favorable
to Parent and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(l) As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material
event, development or change with respect to the Companies and their
Subsidiaries or the Business, that occurs or arises after the date of this
Agreement and on or prior to the date of the Parent Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , that the receipt of a Superior Proposal will not be deemed to
constitute an Intervening Event.

5.15 Proxy Statement; Parent Meeting.

(a) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, a preliminary proxy statement in connection with
seeking the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of Parent (such
proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy
Statement_ "), which shall, subject to _Section 5.14_, include the
Recommendation, and shall use all reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall
furnish to the Purchasers all information concerning the Proxy Statement as
the Purchasers may reasonably request. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchasers shall provide to Parent such information as Parent
may reasonably request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. If, at any time
prior to the Parent Meeting, any inaccuracy or omission of information
relating to Parent or its Affiliates, officers or directors should be
discovered by Parent, or any inaccuracy or omission of information relating
to the Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Purchasers, in either case which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, then such Party shall promptly notify the other
Parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC. Parent shall cause 

 



58  the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that Parent may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement. 

(b) Following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement and unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , Parent shall take all action necessary
in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation and by-laws
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (the "
_Parent Meeting_ ").

 

5.16 Employee Benefits.

(a) Each of the Purchasers agrees that each Company Employee who continues
employment with such Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date
(a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall be provided, for a period extending until
the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employees employment with
such entities or the first anniversary of the Closing Date, with compensation
and benefits that are not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, than
the compensation and benefits provided by the Sellers and/or the Companies to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the date of this Agreement,
excluding for such purpose any equity compensation, defined benefit, retiree
medical, retiree life plan, policy, arrangement, or agreement, and any
retention, transaction, sale or similar bonus or compensation arrangement.
Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require either Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates to continue to employ any particular Employee following the
Closing Date, or (ii) shall be construed to prohibit either Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any Company Plan, or
terminating any Continuing Employee in accordance with applicable Law.

(b) Each of the Purchasers shall take all commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee receives
full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, vesting,
vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit accrual)
for service with the Sellers and/or the Companies prior to the Closing Date
under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies, if
any, of such Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate, as applicable, in which such
Continuing Employee becomes a participant; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits. As of
the Closing Date, each of the Purchasers shall, or shall cause the relevant
Affiliate to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount of unused vacation
time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company Plan as of
the Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by either of the Purchasers or the relevant Affiliate for the
benefit of any Continuing Employees, subject only to any required approval of
the applicable insurance provider and applicable Law, if any, such Purchaser
shall (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under such plan (each to the extent applicable under the Company
Plans), and (ii) cause 

 



59  each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts
paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company Plan for the plan
year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, if any,
maintained by such Purchaser or the relevant Affiliate, as applicable, for
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or any other employee, any
beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any collective bargaining representative
thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee by the
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which such entity may maintain, or otherwise, or (ii) be construed as in any
way modifying or amending the provisions of any Company Plan. The Sellers
shall cooperate with the Purchasers and any applicable Affiliate thereof in
respect of the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.16_, including making
available such non-confidential data in personnel records as is necessary for
the Purchasers to effectuate this _Section 5.16_.

(d) The Sellers shall accelerate for any Continuing Employee as of the
Closing Date the vesting and exercisability of any unvested benefits and
awards under any Company Plan (including under any 401(k) Plan and any
outstanding equity compensation awards). For the avoidance of doubt, all
performance conditions related to any unvested benefits and awards will be
deemed to have been met. Any such awards that are stock options or similar
awards will remain exercisable for the period provided in the
applicable award agreement.

(e) Each of the Purchasers agrees to provide continuation health care
coverage, as defined in Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 to 608 of
ERISA, to all employees and former employees (and their qualified
beneficiaries) (i) who incur or incurred a qualifying event prior to the
Closing Date or as a result of the Closing and (ii) to whom any Company or
any of their Subsidiaries are, on or before the Closing Date, (A) providing
such continuation coverage or (B) under an obligation to provide such
continuation coverage at the election of the employee or former employee or
his or her qualified beneficiary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchasers
shall have no obligation to provide continuation coverage for any employee or
former employee (or a qualified beneficiary thereof) of any Seller
or Affiliate thereof other than the Companies and their Subsidiaries.

5.17 Reserved.

 

5.18 Restructuring Transactions. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent and each of the Sellers shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, consummate the Restructuring
Transactions substantially in the manner described in _Section 1.3_ of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



60 5.19 Certain Post-Closing Covenants. During the fourteen (14) month
period immediately following the Closing and for so long thereafter as any
claim for indemnification made pursuant to Article IX during such fourteen
(14) month period remains outstanding and unresolved, the Sellers shall not,
and Parent shall cause the Sellers not to, permit Cash and Cash Equivalents,
determined on a monthly basis over any calendar month during such period, as
reflected on Parents consolidated balance sheet (prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout such period), to be less than
the Minimum Cash Balance. Parent shall provide the Purchasers reasonable
verification (and provision of a bank or similar statement shall be deemed to
constitute a non-exclusive means of such verification) of Cash and Cash
Equivalents meeting the Minimum Cash Balance on a monthly basis.

5.20 Post-Closing Name Change. Promptly, but in no event more than 60 days
following the Closing, Parent and the Sellers shall, and shall cause each of
their Affiliates and their Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and their
Subsidiaries) to remove all references to the Primus Trademark and all
Intellectual Property related to the Primus Trademark, and file all necessary
paperwork to effect the foregoing name change.

5.21 PTI Distributions. PTI shall not, and Parent and the Sellers shall cause
PTI not to, make any cash distributions (other than the Management Fee) during
the period, if any, between the Closing and the Second Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if the Second Closing does not occur prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing and the Sellers and the Purchasers have not
otherwise agreed in writing to work toward a Second Closing, then PTI shall
no longer be subject to any restrictions on making cash distributions (other
than the Management Fee) from such anniversary date so long as there is no
accrued and unpaid Management Fee.

at the close of business on the Closing Date.

7.2 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Contests.

(a) The Purchasers and the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article VII_ and any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. The Purchasers and the Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and
records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Companies, their Subsidiaries and the Business relating to any taxable
period beginning on or prior to the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the other Party, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (ii)

(c) After the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall notify the Sellers within
ten (10) days of the commencement of any notice of Tax deficiency, proposed
Tax adjustment, Tax assessment, Tax audit, Tax examination or other
administrative or court proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim with respect
to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period affecting the Taxes of or with
respect to any of the Companies or the Companies Subsidiaries that, if
determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time would
reasonably be expected to result in an increase in Tax liability of the
Sellers or their respective Affiliates under this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_
"). Thereafter, the Purchasers shall deliver to the Sellers, as promptly as
possible 

 



67  but in no event later than twenty (20) days after receipt thereof, copies of
all relevant notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Purchasers or any of their respective Affiliates. The Sellers shall, at their
sole expense, have the right to control the conduct of any such Tax Claim and
shall have the right to settle any such Tax Claim; provided, however, that
neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall enter into any
settlement of or otherwise compromise any Tax Claim that adversely affects or
may adversely affect the Tax liability of the Purchasers, the Companies or any
of the Companies Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing for
any period ending after the Closing Date, including the portion of the
Straddle Period that is after the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of Purchasers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided, further, that the elimination, reduction, limitation or
other change of any nature to any net operating loss, non-capital loss,
capital loss, Tax credit, Tax basis or other Tax attribute of any of the
Companies or the Companies Subsidiaries shall not be considered as adversely
affecting the Tax liability of the Purchasers, the Companies or any of the
Companies Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing. The Sellers shall
keep the Purchasers fully and timely informed with respect to
the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Claim.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2(c)_ above, or if Seller
does not elect to control a proceeding pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ above,
the Purchasers shall have the right to control any audit or examination by any
tax authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return,
and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to, the
income, assets or operations of the Companies and the Companies Subsidiaries
for all taxable periods; _provided_ , _however_ , the Purchasers shall not,
and shall cause their Affiliates (including the Companies and the Companies
Subsidiaries) not to, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue with respect to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date that could increase the Tax liability
of the Sellers without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

7.3 Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving the Companies and/or their Subsidiaries shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the
Companies nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

 

7.4 Post-Closing Actions.

(a) Unless as otherwise required by applicable law, the Purchasers, the
Companies, the Companies Subsidiaries and each of their Affiliates shall not
take any position with respect to Taxes of any of the Companies or the
Companies Subsidiaries that reasonably could be expected to adversely affect
the Tax liability of any of the Companies or the Companies Subsidiaries in a
taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date unless the Sellers have
consented in writing to such action, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

(b) The Purchasers in their sole discretion shall determine whether to make
an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any of the Companies
and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. The Sellers shall
cooperate in good faith to assist the Purchasers in determining whether to
make an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any of the
Companies and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including,
upon request from the Purchasers, promptly providing any relevant information
to the Purchasers, including the Sellers tax bases in the stock of the
Companies, the fair market value of the Companies assets and the Companies
tax bases in their assets. In the event that the Purchasers desire to make an
election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to any of the Companies
and the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, to the extent required
by Law, the Purchasers and the Sellers shall jointly file, or permit to be
jointly filed, any such elections under Section 338 of the Code; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Taxes imposed on the Sellers after the making of a
Section 338 election exceed the Taxes that would have been imposed on the
Sellers if no such Section 338 election had been made, the Purchasers will
reimburse each Seller the dollar amount by which the Taxes imposed on that
Seller after the making of an effective Section 338 election exceeds
the Taxes that would have been imposed on that Seller if no such Section 338
election had been made. At the Sellers request, at Closing the Purchasers
shall sign any elections under Section 338 of the Code contemplated by this 
_Section 7.4(d)_ as prepared by the Sellers.

 



68 7.5 Tax Refunds. The Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refund or amounts
credited against any Tax of the Companies and/or their Subsidiaries, in each
case, that do not relate to deductions or credits arising with respect to
amounts funded by the Purchasers, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The
Purchasers shall forward to the Sellers the benefit of any such Tax refund or
credit, net of reasonable fees or expenses incurred by the Purchasers or the
Companies or any of the Companies Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund or
credit, within ten (10) days after the Tax refund is received, either
pursuant to a cash payment or through the reduction of a Tax liability.
Notwithstanding anything else in this _Section 7.5_ to the contrary, the
Purchasers shall not be obligated to pay any refund or other amount under
this _Section 7.5_ to the extent that any such refund or credit is the result
of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in a taxable period beginning on or after the Closing Date
(including the portion of any Straddle Period beginning on or after the
Closing Date). To the extent a refund or credit against Taxes that gave rise
to a payment hereunder is subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced, the
Sellers shall pay to the Purchasers the amount of such disallowed or reduced
refund or credit against Taxes.

7.6 Reserved.

 

7.7 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration
and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement, shall be borne solely by the
Sellers, and the Sellers shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

70 8.2 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , this Agreement (other than
the provisions set forth in the first sentence of _Section 5.4(a)_, _Section
5.8_, _Section 8.2_, _Article VIII_ and _Article X_ ) shall become void and
of no effect with no liability on the part of any Party (or any of their
respective Affiliates or representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
nothing herein shall relieve any Party from liability for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement prior to the
date of termination and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from any
liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach
of this Agreement.

8.3 Termination Fees.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) _Section 8.1(d)_ or (ii) _Section
8.1(b)_ and prior to such time Parent or either Seller shall have breached
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements herein which
breach remains uncured and results in the failure of a condition in _Sections
6.1_ or _6.2_ to be satisfied, then in either case, the Sellers jointly and
severally shall reimburse the Purchasers an amount equal to the reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by each of the Purchasers and any of their
Affiliates on their behalf (including, reasonable attorney and accountant
fees and expenses) up to a maximum aggregate amount of 1% of the Purchase
Price in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
within two (2) business days after presentment by the Purchasers of
supporting documentation in reasonable detail (any such payment, " _Expenses_
"). In the event that any Expenses are paid to the Purchasers pursuant to this
_Section 8.3(a)_, such payment of Expenses shall reduce the amount of
any Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ on a dollar for
dollar basis by the amount of such Expenses.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.3(a)_, if:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (I) _Section 8.1(d)_ or
(II) _Section 8.1(b)_ and prior to such time Parent or the Sellers shall
have breached any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements herein which breach remains uncured and results in the failure
of a condition in _Sections 6.1_ or  _6.2_ to be satisfied; (B) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_ (under
circumstances described in the preceding clause (A)(II)), any bona fide
Alternative Transaction (substituting fifty percent (50%) for the twenty-five
percent (25%) thresholds set forth in the definition of "Alternative
Transaction") or any bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the purchase of all
or substantially all the Equity Interests or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Companies (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") shall have
been publicly announced and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (C)
within three months following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to

 



71   _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_ (under circumstances described in
the preceding clause (A)(II)), either the Qualifying Transaction referenced in
the immediately preceding clause (B) is consummated or Parent enters into a
definitive agreement providing for the Qualifying Transaction referenced in
the immediately preceding clause (B) and, whether or not during such three-
month period, such Qualifying Transaction is subsequently consummated; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent and the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_, or by the Purchasers pursuant to
_Section 8.1(f)_,

then, in the case of the foregoing clause (i) or (ii), as applicable, the
Sellers shall pay to the Purchasers a fee equal to $3,870,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), such payment to be made, in the case of a termination
referenced in clause (i) above, upon consummation of the Qualifying
Transaction, or in the case of clause (ii) above, concurrently with the
termination by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(g)_
or within two (2) business days after termination by the Purchasers pursuant
to _Section 8.1(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent or
the Sellers be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
Any such payment shall be net of any amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of U.S.
state or local tax Law.

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Purchasers
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the Termination Fee is required
to be paid as a result of a termination of this Agreement, the Purchasers
right to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section
8.3_ shall be the exclusive remedy of the Purchasers and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable for (A) the loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Closing to be consummated and (B) any other losses, damages,
obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of or under this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and upon payment of the
Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, none of Parent, the
Sellers or any of their respective stockholders, directors, officers or
agents, as the case may be, shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

8.4 Purchaser Termination Payment.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to: (i)
_Section 8.1(h)_; (ii) _Section 8.1(b)_ and at the time of such termination
this Agreement is terminable pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_; or (iii)
_Section 8.1(b)_ and prior to such time either Purchaser shall have breached
any of their respective representations, 

 



72  warranties, covenants or agreements herein which breach remains uncured and
results in the failure of a condition in _Sections 6.1_ or _6.3_ to be
satisfied; then, in any such case, the Purchasers shall pay to Parent US$
25,000,000 (the " _Purchaser Termination Payment_ ") as liquidated damages,
and not as penalty, by wire transfer in immediately available funds within
five (5) business days of the earlier to occur of such events. Purchasers
hereby expressly waive and relinquish any right which it may have to seek to
characterize said Purchaser Termination Payment and liquidated damages as a
penalty, and the parties hereto agree that such amount is a reasonable, fair
and equitable payment of compensation in light of the complex commercial
nature of this Agreement and the inability to estimate the extraordinary harm
that will occur to Parent if the Purchase Agreement is not consummated.
In arriving at this agreement regarding the liquidated damages amount, the
parties hereto acknowledge that: (i) there is relative equality in the
bargaining power of the parties, (ii) the parties are each represented by and
have consulted with counsel regarding this issue, (iii) the parties
anticipate that proof of actual damages for any of the breaches would be
costly and inconvenient, (iv) there may be difficulty or burdens of proving
causation or foreseeability, and (v) this Agreement regarding the liquidated
damages amount is entered into freely and without duress.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which the Parent terminates the Purchase Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.4(a)_ and receives the Purchaser Termination Payment, Parents
termination of this Agreement and right to receive payment of the Purchaser
Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Sellers or any of its or their respective Affiliates, against Purchasers and
(a) any direct or indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of
Purchasers (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member,
stockholder or otherwise), (b) Affiliate of Purchasers, or (c) director,
officer, employee, manager, representative, or agent of Purchasers, any of
the foregoing persons or entities respective Affiliates or any direct or
indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of any such person or
entity (collectively, the " _Purchaser Party Affiliates_ ") under the
Transaction Documents for any and all Losses that may be suffered as a result
of, based upon or arise out of any breach of or failure to perform or comply
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the Transaction
Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and upon receipt
of the Purchaser Termination Payment pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ above, none
of the Purchaser Party Affiliates shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of the Transaction Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 8.4_ shall limit any remedies of Parent and Sellers
prior to a termination as set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_ above, including
specific performance under _Section 10.9(a)_; _provided_ that if Parent or
the Sellers are granted an order of specific performance by a court listed
in  _Section 10.9(a)_ which order compels Purchasers to consummate the
Closing (and the Closing is actually consummated), then Parent shall not also
be entitled to receive the Purchaser Termination Payment pursuant to this 
_Section 8.4_.

 



73 ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
representations and warranties of the Parties made herein shall survive the
Closing for a period of fourteen (14) months, and thereafter shall terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a claim for indemnification for breach thereof
shall survive such period only to the extent that a claim was properly made in
accordance with this Article IX before the expiration of such period. All
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed
in whole or in part after the Closing will survive for the period provided in
such covenants and agreements, if any, up to the date that is fourteen (14)
months after the Closing, and thereafter shall terminate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a claim for indemnification for breach thereof shall survive
such period only to the extent that a claim was properly made in accordance
with this Article IX before the expiration of such period. All covenants and
agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in their entirety
on or prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing, except to the extent
such covenant or agreement shall not be performed in its entirety in all
respects in accordance with its terms as of the Closing in which event such
covenant or agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of fourteen (14)
months, and thereafter shall terminate. Except as expressly provided in this
_Section 9.1_, no claim for indemnification hereunder may be made after the
expiration of the applicable survival date set forth in this _Section 9.1_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any indemnity claim (but solely such claim)
described in a Claim Certificate received by the Indemnifying Party prior to
the expiration of the applicable time limitations set forth in this _Section
9.1_ shall survive until the claim is fully resolved.

9.2 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
each of the Purchasers, its Affiliates, the Companies and its and their
respective employees, stockholders, members, directors and officers
(collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from,
against and in respect of, any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) or costs ("
_Losses_ ") (subject to the limitations set forth herein, including in 
_Section 9.5_, " _Indemnified Losses_ "), incurred or suffered by them to the
extent resulting from or, arising out of or based upon:

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by such Seller
contained in this Agreement;

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by such Seller;

 

(iii) any Pre-Closing Taxes;

(iv) any ETA Liability;

 



74 (v) the consummation of any of the Restructuring Transactions, other than any
Pre-Closing Taxes resulting therefrom; and

(vi) obligations of PTCI assigned to the Parent pursuant to the Specified
Assumption Agreement.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, each Purchaser hereby agrees, jointly and
severally with the other Purchaser, to indemnify and hold each Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective employees, stockholders, members, directors,
and officers (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless
from, against and in respect of any and all Indemnified Losses incurred or
suffered by them to the extent resulting from, arising out of or based upon:

(i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties made by such
Purchaser contained in this Agreement; and

(ii) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement to be performed or complied with by such Purchaser.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.5_:

 

(i) all amounts payable by Parent to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of any Seller
Fundamental Representations shall be paid solely as follows:

(A) first, any such amounts shall be paid by means of collection of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account from the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement; and

 

(B) second and finally, any such amounts that remain unpaid after all of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account has been collected by
Indemnified Parties or disbursed to the Sellers Representative pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be paid by
Parent; and

 

(ii) all amounts payable by Parent to any Purchaser Indemnified Parties

Escrow Amount in the ETA Escrow Account from the Escrow Agent pursuant to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(B) second, any such amounts that remain unpaid after all of the ETA Escrow
Amount in the ETA Escrow Account has been collected by Indemnified Parties
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be
paid by means of collection of the Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Indemnity
Escrow Account from the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement; and

(C) third and finally, any such amounts that remain unpaid after all of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount in the Indemnity Escrow Account has been collected by
Indemnified Parties or disbursed to the Sellers Representative pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be paid by
Parent.

 



75 9.3 Claims Procedure; Participation in Litigation.

 

(a) _Procedure for Claims_. For purposes hereof, a party claiming a right to
indemnification shall be referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and any
or all parties against whom such indemnification claim is made shall be
referred to as an " _Indemnifying Party_." An Indemnified Party intending to
assert a claim for indemnification under  _Section 9.2_ (other than a Third-
Party Claim covered by _Section 9.3(c)_ below) shall deliver to each
Indemnifying Party a certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") signed by any
officer of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure
by such Indemnified Party to provide such Claim Certificate promptly will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations
hereunder unless and then only to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure. The Claim Certificate shall: (A) state that an
Indemnified Party has paid, sustained or incurred Indemnified Losses, (B)
specify in reasonable detail the facts pertinent to such claim(s), the
individual items of Indemnified Losses included in the claim and the method of
computation thereof, in each case to the extent reasonably available, and (C)
demand payment for the Indemnified Losses if and when incurred (if not
already incurred). In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to
the indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims,
or any part thereof, specified in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying
Party shall, within thirty (30) business days after receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party
notice to such effect, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such
objection (a " _Claim Response Certificate_ "). Payment for Indemnified
Losses shall be made in the manner provided in _Section 9.6_.

(b) If an Indemnifying Party in a Claim Response Certificate contests the
payment of all or part of any claim set forth in a corresponding Claim
Certificate or responsibility therefor, then such Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute in
accordance with _Section 9.3(d)_ below.

(c) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_.

(iii) All claims for indemnification made under _Section 9.2_ resulting from,
related to or arising out of a third-party claim, demand, action or
proceeding against an Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the
following procedures. In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a
third-party claim which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result
in any Indemnified Losses (without giving effect to the limitations in
_Section 9.5_) (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such

 



76  Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim
by delivery of an Claim Certificate to such Indemnifying Party. Any delay or
failure in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of obligations under _Article IX_ except to the extent, if
at all, that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by reason of such
delay or failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the
defense of any Third-Party Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim, or may no
longer continue to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, to the extent
that (A) the Third-Party Claim seeks non-monetary relief, (B) the Third-Party
Claim involves criminal or quasi criminal allegations, or (C)
the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing after reasonable written notice
and an opportunity to cure to diligently and reasonably prosecute or defend
the Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party elects to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim, and may retain separate
co-counsel of its choice at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying
Party is entitled to and elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
it shall, within thirty (30) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the
Claim Certificate with respect to such Third-Party Claim, notify the
Indemnified Party of its election to do so. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 9.3_, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of
the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a
default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect thereto unless such
settlement, compromise or judgment contains an unqualified written release of
the Indemnified Party and all other Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, from all Liability in respect of the
Third-Party Claim.

(iv) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall assume the defense of such Third-
Party Claim and the cost and expense of counsel shall be Indemnified Losses
to the extent the Third-Party Claim is an Indemnified Loss and such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to withdraw such related costs and expenses
from and reduce the Indemnity Escrow Amount. The parties (other than
the Indemnifying Party) controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim
shall (i) permit the other party (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") to
participate, at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, (ii) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable
diligence and keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed of material
developments in such Third-Party Claim, (iii) promptly submit to the Non-
Controlling Party copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions and
other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection
therewith, (iv) permit the Non-Controlling Party and its counsel to confer on
the conduct of the defense thereof and (v) permit the Non-Controlling Party
and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted
prior to their submission and consider in good faith any comments from the
Non-Controlling Party and its counsel thereto to the extent practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.3_, the
Indemnified Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or 

 



77  compromise any Third-Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect thereto (other than with respect to Third-Party
Claims for Taxes), and in any such event only if (x) the settlement is for an
amount less than the claim amount of the Third-Party Claim set forth in the
Claim Certificate, and (y) such settlement, compromise or judgment contains an
unqualified written release of the Indemnifying Party and all other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, from all
Liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim. No settlement of any Third-
Party Claim with any third party claimant shall be determinative of the
existence of or amount of Indemnified Losses relating to such matter, except
with the consent of the Indemnifying Party.

 

(v) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in all
reasonable respects with one another and with counsel in the investigation,
trial and defense of any Third-Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith at the sole cost and expense
of the party so participating. Such cooperation shall include access during
normal business hours afforded to the other party and its agents and
representatives to, and reasonable retention by any party of, records and
information which have been identified by the other party as being reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient and reasonable basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(d) _Resolution of Non-Third-Party Claims_. In case the Indemnifying Party
shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Claim Certificate
with respect to a non-Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims within
twenty (20) business days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of
the Claim Response Certificate applicable thereto. If the Indemnifying Party
and Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Indemnity Escrow Account if the Indemnity Escrow Amount
remains outstanding, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions from
the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with the terms thereof as
equivalent to a joint written instruction. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party are unable to agree as to any particular item or items or
amount or amounts within such time period, then the Indemnified Party shall be
permitted to submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction as set
forth in _Section 10.9_.

9.4 Purchase Price Adjustment. With respect to any indemnity payment under
this Agreement, the Parties agree to treat, to the extent permitted by Law,
all such payments as an adjustment to the Purchase Price paid hereunder.

 



78 9.5 Limitations.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article IX_ other than _Section
9.7_, neither Parent nor the Sellers nor the Purchasers shall have any
indemnification obligations for Losses under _Section 9.2_ unrelated to any
Tax matter unless the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $500,000
(the " _Basket_ "), at which point the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated
to indemnify the Indemnified Party for the entire amount of any such Loss. In
no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by (i) Parent or
Sellers under _Section 9.2(a)_ exceed an amount equal to the sum of (x)
$12,900,000 (inclusive of amounts paid into the Indemnity Escrow Account) and
(y) any amounts actually paid by Parent or the Sellers to the Purchasers out
of the ETA Escrow Account and the Adjustment Escrow Account (the " _Cap_ ")
or (ii) the Purchasers under _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ exceed the Cap; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing limitations shall not apply to any
indemnification obligations for Losses (x) arising from fraud, (y) under
Section 9.2(a)(i) with respect to breaches of the Seller Fundamental
Representations, or (z) under Section 9.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of
the Purchaser Fundamental Representations;  _provided_ , _further_ , that in
no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by (A) Parent and/or
Sellers under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of the Seller
Fundamental Representations or with respect to fraud exceed the Purchase
Price, or (B) the Purchasers under _Section 9.2(b)(i)_ with respect to
breaches of the Purchaser Fundamental Representations or with respect to fraud
exceed the Purchase Price.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to any Losses to the extent that such Losses (A) are Liabilities set
forth on the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement (up to the amount set
forth thereon therefor), (B) are Liabilities set forth on any Schedule
(except with respect to any matter disclosed on any Schedule, any Losses for
which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(iii)_), (C) arise solely out of changes after the date of
this Agreement in applicable Law or interpretations or applications thereof by
a Governmental Authority, or (D) are attributable to Taxes attributable to
post-Closing taxable periods (or portions thereof) (other than Taxes
attributable to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 3.7(g)_), and (ii) all Losses under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(c) The amount of any Indemnified Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this _Article IX_ shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered and received by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies,
indemnification agreements or otherwise with respect to such Indemnified
Losses. The Indemnified Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any available insurance policies or collateral sources. No
party shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article IX_ with
respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses arise to any material respect
out of any action or knowing inaction of such party. No Indemnified Party
shall have any right to assert any claim against any Indemnifying Party with
respect to any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent such Loss
is a Loss, cause of action or claim with respect to which such Indemnified
party or any of its

 



79  Affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) with the primary
intent of accelerating the time period in which such matter is asserted or
payable in order to cause a claim to be made prior to the applicable date of
expiration survival set forth in _Section 9.1_.

(d) If an Indemnifying Party pays an amount to an Indemnified Party pursuant
to a claim for indemnification under _Section 9.2_ and such Indemnified Party
actually received or realized in connection therewith, during the three
taxable years following the Closing Date, any refund or any reduction of, or
credit against, its Tax liabilities in or prior to the taxable year in which
the indemnification amount is paid (an " _Indemnification Tax Benefit_ "),
such Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount that is
equal to the Indemnification Tax Benefit; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that (A)
any Taxes that are imposed on such Indemnified Party as a result of a
disallowance or reduction of any Indemnification Tax Benefit actually paid to
the Indemnifying Party shall be treated as a Tax for which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section
9.2_ hereof; and (B) nothing in this _Section 9.5(d)_ shall require the
Indemnified Party to disclose any confidential information to the Indemnifying
Party (including its Tax Returns).

(e) The Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate all Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses. 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages of such other
Person (including loss of future revenue, income or profits, diminution of
value or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or
alleged breach hereof), other than consequential, incidental, indirect,
special or punitive damages (including loss of future revenue, income or
profits, diminution in value or losses or business reputation or opportunity),
in each case, that a third party recovers pursuant to any Third-Party Claim.

(g) Upon payment in full of any indemnification claim pursuant to  _Section
9.3_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment
to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person with respect to the
subject matter of such claim. The Indemnified Parties shall permit
the Indemnifying Party to use the name of such Indemnified Parties in any
transaction or in any action or proceeding or other matter involving any of
such rights, and the Indemnified Parties shall assign or otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Parties, to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover
amounts from, any Person liable or responsible for any Losses for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement. If any
indemnification payment is received by any Indemnified Party from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 9.3_, and such Indemnified Party
later receives a payment from another Person in respect of the related
Losses, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to such Indemnifying Party
or its designee an amount equal to the amount of such payment received from
such other Person to the extent such payment would result in a collection of
aggregate amounts for such Indemnified Loss greater than the amount thereof.

 



80 9.6 Payments; Release of Escrow Funds.

 

(a) On each occasion that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall agree that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
under this _Article IX_ , the Indemnifying Party shall, at each such time, pay
the amount of such indemnification in immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by the party entitled to
indemnification hereunder within ten (10) business days after the
determination thereof, and in such case subject to the Cap and as provided in
this _Section 9.6(a)_. On each instance in which the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
payment in respect of an Indemnified Loss from the Indemnity Escrow Account as
provided herein, the Purchasers and the Sellers Representative shall deliver
prompt joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to release payment therefor.

(b) Subject to any other limitations set forth herein, on the day that is
fourteen (14) months following the Closing Date, any portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account that is not subject to
a then pending and properly asserted claim for indemnification pursuant to a
Claim Certificate in accordance with this _Article IX_ shall be released to
Sellers Representative.

(c) Subject to any other limitations set forth herein, on the date that is the
earlier of (i) receipt by PTCI of a positive ruling from the Canada Revenue
Agency that an "internet service provider" providing "internet services" for
primarily resale is not subject to the recapture requirements under the Excise
Tax Act (Canada) and (ii) thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations related thereto, any portion of the ETA
Escrow Amount remaining in the ETA Escrow Account that is not subject to a
then pending and properly asserted claim for indemnification pursuant to a
Claim Certificate in accordance with this  _Article IX_ shall be released to
Sellers Representative.

(d) Subject to any other limitations set forth herein, on the date on which
(i) the Purchasers and Sellers Representative agree, or are deemed to have
agreed to, or the Neutral Arbitrator delivers, the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Statement and (ii) all payments to be made pursuant to  _Section
2.3(d)_ have been made in full, any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be released to Sellers
Representative.

 

(e) If the Second Closing does not occur prior to the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing and the Sellers and the Purchasers have not otherwise agreed
in writing to work toward a Second Closing and notified the Escrow Agent in
writing of the same, then the Escrow Agent shall release the Second Closing
Escrow Amount to the Purchasers.

 



81 9.7 Exclusive Remedies. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary and except as expressly set forth in this _Article IX_ (including
_Section 9.2(c)_), the indemnification rights set forth in this _Article IX_
all of which are subject to the terms, limitations, and restrictions of this 
_Article IX_ , shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after Closing (other
than as set forth in _Section 2.3(d)_) for any and all claims arising out of
or related to this Agreement, including claims based on any breach of
a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement, and
no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies,
entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap
will not apply to Losses arising from or relating to (a) fraud, (b) any breach
of a Seller Fundamental Representation, or (c) any breach of a Purchaser
Fundamental Representation. The provisions of this _Section 9.7_ and the
limited remedies provided in _Section 2.3(d)_, _Article IX_ , Section
8.3, Section 8.4 and _Section 10.9_ were specifically bargained for by the
Parties and were taken into account by the Parties in arriving at the Purchase
Price and the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Parties have
specifically relied upon the provisions of this _Section 9.7_ and the
limited remedies provided in _Section 2.3(d)_, _Article IX_ , Section 8.3,
Section 8.4 and _Section 10.9_ in agreeing to the Purchase Price and
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that

their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed

_Section 8.1_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement (and any other agreement or instrument
executed in connection herewith) exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware

a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
and this right shall include the right of the Sellers to cause the Purchasers
to (and, as applicable, to cause the Purchasers to cause Purchasers
Affiliates to) seek to enforce the terms of the Financing Commitments (and any
definitive agreements related thereto) against the Lenders, Sponsor and any
other applicable party to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to such
Financing Commitments (or any definitive agreements related thereto) and
applicable Laws and to thereafter cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated, in each case, if the conditions set forth
in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing). Subject to _Section 8.4_, the Parties further agree that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.9(a)_, a Party shall
not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this  _Section 10.9(a)_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this _Section
10.9(a)_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any
Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section 10.9(a)_ before exercising any termination right under _Section
8.1_ (and pursuing any other remedies under this Agreement after such
termination) nor shall the commencement of any action or proceeding pursuant
to this _Section 10.9(a)_ or anything contained in this _Section 10.9(a)_
restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of  _Section 8.1_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing)
at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the
funding of the equity financing under the Equity Commitment Letter, (B) the
debt financing under the Manulife Commitment Letter and Senior Debt Commitment
Letter has been funded or will be funded at the Closing on the terms set
forth in the Manulife Commitment Letter and Senior Debt Commitment Letter and

that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then the
Closing pursuant to _Article II_ will occur.

appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives (to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law), and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (i) any claim that
it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for

jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) any claim that (A) the action or proceeding in such court
is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such action or

(d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) ANY
RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHER, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER
