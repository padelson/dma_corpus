treated as a "merger or consolidation" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)) of PBS Holdings, PRE Wildcat Holdings and
Buyer, governed by the "assets-over" form described in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)(3)(i), in which PBS Holdings and PRE Wildcat Holdings are
the "terminated" partnerships (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.708-1(c)) and Buyer is the "resulting" partnership (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)), with the applicable
Sellers treated as selling a portion of their respective Acquired Interests to
Buyer for each such Seller's share of the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.708-1(c)(4) (and each such Seller hereby
expressly consents to such application of Treasury Regulations Section
1.708-1(c)(4)) immediately prior to the Closing. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, each party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to
(i) report, act, and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes

Schedule. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, each party shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to (i) report, act, and file all Tax
Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the Allocation
Schedule, and (ii) not take any position for Tax purposes (whether in audits,
Tax Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule;

Sellers from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing
authority based upon or arising out of the allocation set forth in the
Allocation Schedule, and neither Buyer nor the Sellers shall be required to
litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing
authority challenging the allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule.

quasi-governmental agency or authority or otherwise) against such Seller or to
which such Seller is otherwise a party (a) relating to this Agreement, the
Transactions or the Acquired Interests or the Owned Real Property or (b) that

obligations under this Agreement.

account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution
of such Units. Such Seller understands that the sale of the Units has not been
registered under the Securities Act and, subject to further restrictions in
the Lockup and Registration Rights Agreement, the Units cannot be offered or
re-sold until such offer and sale is subsequently registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 in accordance with the Lockup and Registration Rights

is subject or bound, or (iv) require Buyer to give any notice to, make any
filing with, or obtain any Consent of, any third party or Governmental
Authority, in each case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate the Transactions or
perform Buyer's obligations under this Agreement.

6.5 Issued Units. The Issued Units have been duly authorized by Buyer and,
when issued and delivered at the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, will be validly issued and fully paid.

6.6 Investment Intention. Buyer is acquiring the Acquired Interests for its
own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to the
distribution of such Acquired Interests. Buyer understands that the sale of
the Acquired Interests has not been registered under the Securities Act of
1933, and the Acquired Interests cannot be offered or re-sold unless such
offer and sale is subsequently registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or
an exemption from such registration is available to Buyer.

6.7 Brokers. No Person has acted directly or indirectly as a broker, finder or
financial advisor for Buyer in connection with the negotiations relating to
the Transactions, and no Person is entitled to any fee or commission or like
payment in respect thereof based in any way on any agreement, arrangement or
understanding made by or on behalf of Buyer.

6.8 Financing. No later than two Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer will enter into, and provide to Sellers' Representative a
true, correct and complete copy of that certain underwriting agreement (the
"Underwriting Agreement") in respect of a public offering of its common units
of limited partnership interest under its current S-3 shelf registration in an
amount sufficient to finance the Cash Purchase Price (the "Offering").
Assuming the completion of the Offering in accordance with the terms of the
Underwriting Agreement, the proceeds of the Offering will be sufficient to
satisfy Buyer's obligation to pay the Cash Purchase Price at the Closing.

Buyer shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may be
available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek equitable

and such covenant shall be deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the
maximum time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted
by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this Section 7.6 and each
provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written

provision in any other jurisdiction.

similar transaction).

(b) Buyer acknowledges that the mere receipt by any Seller or the Acquired
Entities or any of their Representatives of an unsolicited inquiry or proposal

orally and in writing of any proposal regarding any transaction of the type

all such documents, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other appropriate actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all other things, as such other party may reasonably deem

similar Taxes ("Property Tax"), the amount of such Property Tax attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be deemed to be
the amount of such Property Tax for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which
is the number of total days in the entire Straddle Period; and

(b) in the case of any Tax that is based on income, sales, revenue, production
or similar items, or other Taxes that are not Property Taxes, the amount of

notice with respect to any Proceeding relating to the Taxes of or attributable
to the Acquired Entities that, if pursued successfully, could result in or
give rise to, or could reasonably be expected to result in or give rise to,

7.8 and Section 7.12.

ARTICLE 10 
TERMINATION

10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the Sellers' Representative;

(b) by Buyer or the Sellers' Representative by written notice to the other if
the Closing does not occur on or before March 31, 2017 (the "End Date");
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
such date;

(c) by Buyer by written notice to the Sellers' Representative if Buyer is not
then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been
a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by any Seller pursuant to this Agreement that would
give rise to the failure of any of Buyer's conditions specified in Section 9.1
or 9.2, and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by the Sellers
by the End Date;







(d) by the Sellers' Representative by written notice to Buyer if no Seller is
then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement and there has been
a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to perform any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement that would give
rise to the failure of any of the Seller's conditions specified in Section 9.1
or 9.3 and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured by Buyer by the
End Date;

(e) as described in Section 10.2(b); or

(f) by Buyer or the Sellers' Representative if (i) there shall be any Law that
makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited, or
(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order permanently
restraining or enjoining the Transactions and such Order shall have become
final and non-appealable.

10.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 10.1,
this Agreement shall immediately become void and there shall be no liability
or obligation on the part of Buyer (other than pursuant to Section 10.2(b)) or
the Sellers or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or
Affiliates; provided, however, that the provisions of Sections 7.4
(Confidentiality), 7.5 (No Public Announcement) and 10.3 (Remedies), and
Article 13 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 10.1, Buyer and the Sellers agree that the term of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be extended for a period of one year from the
date of such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no such
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 10.1 shall prevent or
restrict any party's right to assert claims under this Agreement or recover
Losses for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants prior to such
termination.

(b) If the condition set forth in Section 9.2(j) has not been satisfied on or
prior to the Financing Date (unless such failure occurs during or follows the
New York Stock Exchange's cessation of all equity trading for two consecutive
trading days) and all other conditions set forth in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 have
been satisfied or waived as of the Financing Date (excluding conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing; provided that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied as of the Closing Date) and Buyer
does not satisfy its obligation to close the Transactions at such time, then
Buyer shall pay to the Sellers $10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Sellers' Representative, no later than five Business Days after the Financing
Date. The Sellers and the Acquired Entities agree that if the Termination Fee
is actually paid, then this Agreement shall automatically terminate and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
Closing, the remedy provided for in the prior sentence shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers and the Acquired Entities against Buyer for,
and in no event will the Sellers and the Acquired Entities seek to recover any
other money damages or seek any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity
with respect to, (i) any Losses suffered as a result of the failure of the
Closing to be consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii) any
Liabilities or obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any claims or
Proceedings arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or failure
of Buyer under this Agreement. Each of the parties further acknowledges that
the payment of the Termination Fee by Buyer is not a penalty, but in each case
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Sellers
and the Acquired Entities in the circumstances in which such fees are payable
for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.





10.3 Remedies. Except as provided in Section 10.2(b), any party hereto
terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 shall have, in addition to
all other remedies available hereunder and under applicable Law, the right to
recover Losses sustained by such party as a result of any bad faith
intentional breach by the other party of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or for Fraud; provided,
however, that the party seeking relief is not in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement under
circumstances which would have permitted the other party to terminate the
Agreement under Section 10.1.

(iii) for a period of six years after the Closing Date, any and all
Liabilities of the Acquired Entities existing, or arising out of facts or

(A) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of, or attributable to, the Acquired

or similar Contract that was executed or in effect at any time prior to

(b) Each Seller shall be solely and individually responsible for and indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Losses arising from: (i) any inaccuracies in or any breach of any

inaccuracies in or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;
(ii) Buyer's or its agents' access to and inspection of the Owned Real

(d) For purposes of this Article 11, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any

contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

11.3 Limitations.

(a) Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article
11, (i) the Sellers shall not be liable in the aggregate to Buyer under
Sections 11.2(a)(i) and 11.2(a)(iii) in excess of the Purchase Price, and (ii)
no Seller shall individually be liable to Buyer under Section 11.2(b) in
excess of the portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller,
in each case other than with respect to Fraud Claims, which shall not be
subject to the foregoing limitations.

(b) Losses Net of Insurance Proceeds. If an Indemnified Party reasonably
determines that any Loss that gives rise to the right to receive
indemnification hereunder is covered by insurance, then such Indemnified Party
shall file a claim thereunder, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
prosecute such claim, and the amount of any Losses otherwise recoverable under
this Article 11 shall be reduced by the amount of such proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or Affiliate thereof (net of any costs
reasonably incurred to obtain such insurance proceeds) (such net amount, a
"Net Insurance Recovery"). If an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
actually receives any such insurance proceeds after such Indemnified Party is
indemnified with respect to all or a portion of any Losses under this Article
11, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party and
pay to such Indemnifying Party the amount of the Net Insurance Recovery with
respect to such Losses.

11.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Third Party Claims.

(i) If any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any Proceeding by any Person who is not a party hereto or an
Affiliate of a party hereto (a "Third Party Claim") against such Indemnified
Party, with respect to which a party hereto is or may be required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnifying Party"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give written notice regarding such claim,
including a reasonably detailed description of the Third Party Claim, the
breach of this Agreement giving rise to the applicable indemnification
obligations of the Indemnifying Party, copies of all written correspondence,
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to such Third Party Claim, and to the extent reasonably
ascertainable, the estimated amount of Losses that the Indemnified Party has
suffered or is reasonably likely



to suffer, in respect of such Third Party Claim (a "Claims Notice"), to the
Indemnifying Party within 30 days after becoming aware of such claim.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly following receipt thereof, copies of all correspondence, notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to such Third Party Claim, to the extent any such documents are not privileged
or subject to obligations of confidentiality. The Indemnifying Party shall
have the right, which shall be exercised by delivering written notice to the
Indemnified Party (the "Defense Notice") within 30 days after receipt from the
Indemnified Party of a Claims Notice, which Defense Notice shall specify the
counsel it will appoint to defend such claim, to conduct at its expense the
defense against such claim in its own name, or if necessary in the name of the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to approve such defense counsel, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. An Indemnifying Party's delivery of a
Defense Notice shall constitute an acceptance of its obligation hereunder to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses, if any, resulting
from the subject Third Party Claim. A failure by an Indemnified Party to give
timely, complete or accurate notice as provided in this Section 11.4(a)(i)
will not affect the rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby (so long as a valid
Claims Notice is given before the expiration of the applicable period set
forth in Section 11.1).

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give a Defense Notice within the
required 30-day period set forth in Section 11.4(a)(i), it shall be deemed to
have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject claim, and in such
event the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense (to the extent indemnifiable hereunder), to conduct the defense in
good faith and appoint defense counsel and to consent to the entry of any
judgment or compromise and settle the Third Party Claim in good faith without
prior consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right at its expense to participate in such defense assisted by counsel of its
own choosing, and, for purposes of clarity, the Indemnifying Party shall not
be deemed to have accepted, or waived any rights or defenses with respect to,
any liability for or with respect to any claim for which indemnification is
sought hereunder as a result of any failure to deliver a Defense Notice within
the required 30-day period set forth in Section 11.4(a)(i).

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party does deliver a Defense Notice within the
required 30-day period set forth in Section 11.4(a)(i) and thereby elects to
conduct the defense of the subject Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall conduct the defense in good faith at its expense and shall have the
right to consent to the entry of any judgment or compromise and settle the
Third Party Claim in good faith without prior consent of the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the
entry of any judgment or compromise or enter into any settlement without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party if: (i) such judgment or
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a full release from
all Liability in respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) such judgment or
settlement would result in the finding or admission of any violation of any
Law, (iii) such judgment or settlement would impose Liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not indemnified
hereunder (other than customary confidentiality obligations), or (iv) as a
result of such judgment or settlement, injunctive or other equitable or
similar relief would be imposed against any Indemnified Party or such judgment
or settlement could reasonably be expected to interfere with or adversely
affect any Indemnified Party's business or operations as conducted in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The Indemnified
Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in such defense
assisted by counsel of its own choosing.

(iv) All of the parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any Third
Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and Buyer
and each Seller shall (and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to) furnish
such records, information and testimony, attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, and make such employees available
on a



mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any relevant material, in each case as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

(b) Direct Claims. If any claim for indemnification hereunder involves a
matter other than a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified
Party shall promptly deliver a Claims Notice to an Indemnifying Party
requesting indemnification and specifying the basis on which indemnification
is sought and the amount of asserted Losses. The failure by any Indemnified
Party to notify the Indemnifying Party promptly (so long as a valid Claims
Notice is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in
Section 11.1) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that
it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 11.2 except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall
have 30 days to object to such Direct Claim by delivery of a written notice of
such objection to the Indemnified Party specifying in reasonable detail the
basis for such objection. No action shall be taken in respect of such Direct
Claim by the Indemnified Party until the expiration of such 30-day response
period unless waiting until the expiration of such period will reasonably
materially harm such Indemnified Party's ability to recover for such Direct
Claim; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to any action
by the Indemnified Party seeking an injunction, a permanent or temporary
restraining order or any other form of equitable relief. Failure to timely so
object shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the Direct Claim by
the Indemnifying Party. If an objection is timely interposed by the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall negotiate in good faith for a period of 30 days from the date the
Indemnified Party receives such objection (the "Negotiation Period"). After
the Negotiation Period, if the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
still do not agree on the resolution of a Direct Claim, either the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party may submit the dispute concerning
such Direct Claim for judicial resolution as provided in Section 13.10.

(c) Final Judgments; Purchase Price Adjustment. Any final judgment entered or
settlement agreed upon pursuant to and in accordance with this Article 11
shall be binding upon the Indemnifying Party, and shall conclusively be deemed
to be an obligation with respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
prompt indemnification hereunder. All indemnification payments under this
Article 11 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.

11.5 Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Exclusive Remedy. Other than as set forth in Section 13.8 (Specific
Performance) and Section 7.6 (Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation), or with
respect to any claim for Fraud, each party acknowledges and agrees that from
and after the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and
all claims against another party for any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, regardless of the manner in
which such claim is characterized or pleaded (i.e. whether such claim is
characterized or pleaded as arising in tort, breach of contract, strict
liability, indemnification, or otherwise) shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 11. In furtherance of the
foregoing, from and after the Closing, each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth under this Agreement, as set forth in Section 13.8
(Specific Performance) and Section 7.6 (Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation), or
with respect to any Fraud Claim.

11.6 Contribution among Sellers. As among the Sellers, but without otherwise
limiting any obligation of any Seller to any Buyer Indemnified Party under
this Article 11, with respect to Losses for



which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under Section
11.2(a), (a) PRE III shall be solely responsible for any such Losses to the
extent they relate solely to PRE Wildcat Holdings, its assets, Liabilities or
operations, (b) each Seller shall be solely responsible for any such Losses to
the extent they relate solely to his or its own fraud, and (c) to the extent
any other Seller actually pays any Buyer Indemnified Party any amount in
respect of the Losses described in (a) and (b) of this Section 11.6, the
Seller responsible for such Losses under this Section 11.6 shall promptly
reimburse such other Seller for the amount of such payment and shall indemnify
such other Seller against any reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred
by such other Seller in connection with any indemnification claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Party against such other Seller in respect of such Losses.


ARTICLE 12

SELLER MATTERS



12.1 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Platte River
Equity III, L.P. as such Seller's true, lawful and sole agent and attorney-in-
fact to act for and on behalf of such Seller in all matters relating to or
arising out of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including (i)
receiving all demands and notices on or with respect to such Seller under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) taking any action or refraining
from taking any action as Sellers' Representative may deem appropriate in its
discretion relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, (iii) executing and delivering the Lockup and Registration Rights
Agreement, Escrow Agreement and any other Ancillary Agreements, any amendment
to this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements, and all other instruments and
documents of every kind incident to or otherwise relating to this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, (iv) directing any payments due from Buyer
authorizing the delivery to Buyer of all or any portion of the funds from the
Escrow Account, (v) taking any action on behalf of Sellers or any individual
Seller that may be necessary or desirable, as determined by Sellers'
Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with negotiating or
entering into settlements, resolutions and compromises with respect to
indemnification claims of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, (vi) accepting
notices on behalf of Sellers or any individual Seller in accordance with
Section 13.7, (vii) granting any consent or approval on behalf of Sellers or
any individual Seller under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, (viii)
authorizing distribution of the Additional Real Property Purchase Price, (ix)
taking all actions on behalf of each Seller pursuant to this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement to which such Seller is a party and (x) taking all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of Sellers' Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Each Seller shall be fully bound by the acts,
decisions and agreements of Sellers' Representative taken and done pursuant to
the authority herein granted, and such Seller hereby confirms all that
Sellers' Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of its
appointment as Sellers' Representative. The appointment of Sellers'
Representative pursuant to this Section 12.1 (x) is coupled with an interest,
shall be irrevocable and (to the maximum extent permitted by Law) shall
survive the dissolution, termination, death, incompetency or bankruptcy of any
Seller and shall be binding on such Seller's beneficiaries, heirs,
representatives and successors and (y) may be exercised by Sellers'
Representative by signing separately as Sellers' Representative for each
Seller or, after listing all Sellers executing an instrument, by signing as
Sellers' Representative for all of them. Buyer and all other Persons may
conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of Sellers'
Representative in all matters referred to in this Agreement.

(b) Each Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and to save and hold harmless
Sellers' Representative from any liability incurred by Sellers' Representative
based upon or arising out of any act, whether of omission or commission, of
Sellers' Representative pursuant to the authority herein granted, other than
acts, whether of omission or commission, of Sellers' Representative that
constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct in the exercise by Sellers'
Representative of the authority granted by this Section 12.1.



Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel,
accountants or other independent experts experienced in the matter at issue,
and any error in judgment or other act or omission of Sellers' Representative
pursuant to such advice shall in no event subject Sellers' Representative to
liability to any Seller.

(c) Sellers' Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed, may resign
and shall be discharged of his, her or its duties hereunder upon the
appointment of a successor Sellers' Representative, as hereinafter provided.
In case of such resignation, or in the event of the death or inability to act
of Sellers' Representative, a successor may be named by Sellers representing a
majority of the Closing Percentages. Each such successor Sellers'
Representative shall have all the power, authority, rights and privileges
hereby conferred upon the original Sellers' Representative, and the term
"Sellers' Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any such
successor Sellers' Representative.

(d) In connection with the performance of its responsibilities as Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement, Sellers' Representative shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to select and engage, at the cost and
expense of Sellers (based on each Seller's Closing Percentage), such
attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, advisors, consultants and clerical
personnel and obtain such other professional and expert assistance, as
Sellers' Representative determines is necessary or desirable.

(e) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by each Seller, Sellers' Representative
shall not be entitled to any compensation for the performance of services
under this Agreement, but shall be entitled, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to payment or reimbursement of all expenses incurred as
Sellers' Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Sellers' Representative constitutes a decision of all the Sellers and is
final, binding and conclusive upon the Sellers, and Buyer may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers' Representative as
being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers. Buyer is
hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done or
omissions by Buyer in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers' Representative. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer is entitled to rely, without inquiry, upon any document
delivered by the Sellers' Representative as being genuine and correct and
having been duly signed or sent by the Sellers' Representative.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller hereby
agrees that Buyer shall have no responsibility to see to the payment of any
amounts due to a Seller under this Agreement to the appropriate Seller, its
sole responsibility being to make any such payments to such accounts as are
specified in writing by the Sellers' Representative.


ARTICLE 13

MISCELLANEOUS



13.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
parties shall bear their respective expenses incurred or to be incurred in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the completion of the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers shall be responsible for all Selling Expenses.

13.2 No Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative and Buyer, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. No
assignment shall release the assigning party of its obligations or liabilities
under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their



respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the above, Buyer
may, without the consent of Sellers, assign its rights under this Agreement to
(i) any Affiliate of Buyer or (ii) any lender of Buyer, as collateral security
for indebtedness due and owing by Buyer or the Acquired Entities to such
lender, provided that in each case specified in clause (i) and (ii) of this
sentence, Buyer shall remain directly liable to the Sellers for all of Buyer's
obligations or liabilities under this Agreement.

13.3 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by Buyer and the Sellers' Representative on behalf of
Sellers. No breach of any provision hereof shall be deemed waived unless
expressly waived in writing by the party hereto who may assert such breach.
Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, no delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such
right, and no waiver of any breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any
other breach or default of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.

13.4 Headings and Captions. The headings and captions contained in this
Agreement are included for purposes of convenience only, and shall not affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
contained herein.

13.5 Integration, Modification and Waiver. This Agreement, together with the
Exhibits, schedules, Disclosure Schedules and certificates or other
instruments and agreements (including the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement) delivered under or in connection with this
Agreement: (i) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior
understandings of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder; provided, however, that the Buyer Indemnified Parties and
the Seller Indemnified Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of
Article 11. None of the parties is relying upon any statement or
representation of the other party except as expressly set forth herein, and
each party is relying on its own judgment in connection with the execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.6 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a matter
of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties to this Agreement shall use reasonable efforts to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

13.7 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under

a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement
(as applicable). Minor variations in the form of the signature page, including
footers from earlier versions of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
any such other document, shall be disregarded in determining the party's

Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is

13.13 Disclosure Schedules. The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of

such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) or such items are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the Disclosure Schedules in any
dispute, claim or controversy as to whether any obligation, item or matter not

13.14 Conflict of Interest; Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Each of the parties hereby agrees, notwithstanding any prior
representation of PRE III, PBS PRE III-B Holdings and the Acquired Entities by
Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar and Scott LLP ("Bartlit Beck"), that Bartlit Beck
may serve as counsel to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative and their
respective agents, successors and Affiliates in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions. Following consummation of the Transactions,
if PRE III, PBS PRE III-B Holdings or the Sellers' Representative so desires,
and without the need for any further consent or waiver by Buyer, the Acquired
Entities or their respective Affiliates, Bartlit Beck may serve as counsel to
the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative and their respective agents,
successors and Affiliates in connection with any matter, including any matter
related to the Transactions or any Proceeding or controversy relating thereto.
In the event of any conflict or dispute between the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative or any of their agents, successors and Affiliates on the one
hand, and Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their respective agents,
successors or Affiliates on the other, in which the legal interests of the
relevant parties are not aligned, Buyer and the Acquired Entities, on their
own behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates, hereby consent to Bartlit Beck's
continued and future representation of the Sellers or the Sellers'
Representative or any of their agents, successors and Affiliates and agree not
to assert any such conflict of interest or that Bartlit Beck is barred by any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product or other similar applicable
privilege, protection or expectation of client confidence from disclosing to
the Sellers or their Affiliates any information acquired by Bartlit Beck in
the course of its representation of the Acquired Entities before the Closing
Date, or to seek to disqualify Bartlit Beck from representing the Sellers or
the Sellers' Representative or any of their agents, successors and Affiliates,
notwithstanding any adversity that may develop. Without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, after the Closing, Bartlit
Beck is permitted to represent the Sellers, Sellers' Representative, any of
their agents, successors and Affiliates, or any one or more of them, in
connection with any negotiation or transaction or any dispute, claim or
controversy (including any Proceeding) with Buyer, the Acquired Entities or
any of their respective agents, successors or Affiliates under or relating to
this Agreement, the Transactions and any related matter, including claims for
indemnification under this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Acquired Entities shall cease to have
any attorney-client relationship with Bartlit Beck. Buyer and the Acquired
Entities covenant from and after the Closing Date not to disclose or use (and
to cause their Affiliates not to disclose or use) in any dispute or Proceeding
adverse to the interests of the Sellers or the Sellers' Representative or any
of their agents, successors and Affiliates any communications made prior to
the Closing between any of the Acquired Entities or any Seller or the Sellers'
Representative, on the one hand, and their external legal counsel (including
Bartlit Beck), on the other hand, that were made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution or delivery of, or performance under, this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (the "Privileged Information"). Buyer and
the Acquired Entities further covenant to assert (and to cause their
Affiliates to assert) in any such dispute or Proceeding any applicable
attorney-client privilege with respect to the Privileged Information in the
event Buyer, any of the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates is
compelled to disclose the Privileged Information. The Parties acknowledge that
Bartlit Beck has represented only PRE III, PBS PRE III-B Holdings and the
Acquired Entities in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and the Transactions, and that Bartlit Beck
has not undertaken to represent, nor represented, any other Person in
connection therewith.
