The  respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have
approved  this Agreement, and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub
with and  into  Company (the " ** _Merger_** ")  upon  the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance  with  the
Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 78 and Chapter 92A (collectively, " **
_Nevada  Corporate Law_** ").

 

 

In  consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants  and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as

surviving corporation  of the Merger (the " ** _Surviving  Corporation_**
").

.   Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
cause  the  Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger, in such
appropriate  form  as determined by the parties, with the Secretary of State

Nevada Corporate Law (the  " ** _Articles  of Merger_** ")  (the  time of
such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by  Company  and
Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger) being the " ** _Effective 
Time_** ")  as  soon as practicable following satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions  set forth  in Article VI. The closing of the Merger (the " **
_Closing_** ")  shall  take place at the offices of Morris, Manning and

1.3 _Effect  of the Merger_

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

.   At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in 
this  Agreement and the applicable provisions of Nevada Corporate Law.
Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
the  property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger  Sub  shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and  duties  of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties  of the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.4 _Articles  of Incorporation; Bylaws_

 

 

.  

 

 

(a) At  the  Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the Articles
of  Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except that the name of
Company,  as  the Surviving Corporation, shall be "Vine, Inc." and Article
FIRST of the  Articles of Incorporation shall read in its entirety as
follows: "The name of  the corporation is "VitalStream Holdings, Inc."

 

 

(b) At  the  Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect

.   The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
directors  of  Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
their respective  successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The

Merger Sub immediately  prior  to the Effective Time, until their respective
successors are duly  appointed.

 

 

1.6 _Effect  on Capital Stock_

 

 

.   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective 
Time, by  virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger  Sub,  the Company or holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, the  following shall occur:

 

 

(a) _Company  Common Stock_.  Each  share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (the  " ** _Company  Common Stock_** ")  issued 
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " ** _Shares_**
"),  other  than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to 
Section 1.6(b), shall be automatically converted into and become 
exchangeable for 0.5132 (the " ** _Exchange  Ratio_** ")  shares  of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (the " ** _Parent  Common
Stock_** ")  (the  shares of Parent Common Stock into which each share of
Company Common Stock  is  to be converted, the " ** _Merger 
Consideration_** ")  upon  the surrender of the certificate representing
such shares of Company Common  Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7
(or in the case of a lost,  stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of
an affidavit (and bond,  if  required) in the manner provided in Section
1.9). As of the Effective Time,  all shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding, shall  be  canceled and extinguished and shall cease
to exist and (i) each certificate  (a " ** _Certificate_** ")  formerly
representing any of such shares of Company Common Stock, other  than  shares
of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b),  and (ii)
each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock registered to  a  holder
on the stock transfer books of the Company, other than shares of  Company 
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), shall thereafter 
represent only the right to the Merger Consideration and the right, if  any,
to  receive pursuant to Section 1.7(g) cash in lieu of fractional shares
into  which  such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
pursuant to this  Section  1.6(a) and any distribution or dividend pursuant
to Section 1.7(h), in  each case  without interest.

 

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock_.  Each  share
of Company Common Stock held by Company, any Company Subsidiaries,  Merger 
Sub, Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective 
Time  shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

 

 

(c) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_.  Each  share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (" ** _Merger  Sub Common Stock_** "), 
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be 
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of 
common  stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Following  the  Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of
shares of common  stock  of Merger Sub shall evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock  of the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(d) _Employee  Stock Options_.

 

 

(i) At  the  Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Company
Shares (a " ** _Company  Option_** ")  under  the Company Plans identified
in Section 2.12 of the Company Disclosure  Letter as  being the only Company
Plans pursuant to which shares of Company Common  Stock  may be issued or
benefits measured by the value of shares of Company Common  Stock may be
obtained (the " ** _Company  Stock Plans_** "),  whether vested or unvested,
shall be converted into an option to acquire  a  number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded up  to the  nearest whole number)
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock  subject to the Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and  (y)  the Exchange Ratio,
at an exercise price per share (rounded down to the  nearest  whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option  immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio;  provided,
however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of  Parent  Common
Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined  in  a
manner consistent with the requirements that must be met for Company 
Options  to avoid classification as "deferred compensation" subject to
Section 409A  of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **
_Code_** ");  provided, further, that in the case of any Company Option to
which Section  422  of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number
of shares of Parent  Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall
be determined in  accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments
as are necessary  in  order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of
the Code. Except  as  specifically provided above, following the Effective
Time, each Company  Option  shall continue to be governed by the same terms
and conditions as were  applicable under such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective  Time. At  or prior to the Effective Time, Company
shall take all such action necessary  to  adopt appropriate amendments to
the Company Stock Plans, including using  its  reasonable best efforts in
accordance with Section 5.2 to cause its stockholders  to approve such
amendments, to the extent necessary to effectuate the provisions  of this
Section 1.6(d), and the Board of Directors of the Company shall  adopt  such
other appropriate resolutions as may be necessary to effectuate the 
provisions of this Section 1.6(d). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent 
shall take all actions as are necessary for the assumption of the Company 
Stock  Plans pursuant to this Section 1.6(d), including the issuance
(subject  to  Section 1.6(d)(ii)) and listing of Parent Common Stock as
necessary to  effect  the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.6(d).

 

 

(ii) Parent  shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **
_SEC_** "),  within 5 business days following the Effective Time, a
registration statement  on  Form S-8 (or any successor form), registering
under the Securities Act  of 1933,  as amended (the " ** _Securities 
Act_** "),  options to purchase shares of, and shares of, Parent Common Stock
issued  under  the Company Stock Plan, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts  to  maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and to maintain  the  current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein and  comply  with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws) for so long as awards  granted under the
Company Stock Plans remain outstanding. As soon as reasonably  practicable
after the registration of such interests or shares, as applicable,  Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Company Options by any permissible  method 
appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the 
respective Company Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of 
such  Company Options, and stating that such Company Options and agreements
have  been  assumed by Parent in accordance with the applicable terms.

 

 

(iii) Without  limiting the applicability of Sections 1.6(d)(i) and (ii), the
Company  shall  take all necessary action to ensure that the Surviving
Corporation will  not be  bound at the Effective Time by any options, or
other rights, awards or  arrangements under the Company Stock Plans that
would entitle any Person  after  the Effective Time to acquire any shares of
Company Common Stock or to  receive  any payments in respect thereof with
respect to exercises or conversions  occurring following the Effective Time.
At or prior to the Effective Time,  Company shall take all such action
necessary to adopt appropriate amendments  to  the Company Stock Plans,
including using its reasonable best efforts in  accordance with Section 5.2
to cause its stockholders to approve such  amendments, to the extent
necessary to effectuate the provisions of this  Section  1.6(d)(iii), and
the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt such  other  appropriate
resolutions as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions  of this 
Section 1.6(d)(iii).

 

 

(e) _Warrants_.  At the  Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised
warrant to purchase shares  of  Company Common Stock (each, a " **
_Company  Warrant_** "),  whether or not exercisable or vested as of such
date, shall be  canceled.

 

 

1.7 _Surrender  of Certificates_

 

 

.  

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  At or  before the Effective Time, Parent shall
select, and enter into an agreement  with, an institution reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the paying  agent  (the " ** _Paying 
Agent_** ")  in the  Merger. Parent shall make available to the Paying Agent
for payment in  accordance with this Article I, and at or promptly after (but
no more than  three  business days) the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
or cause to be  deposited  with the Paying Agent (i) certificates
representing the shares of Parent  Common  Stock to be exchanged for shares
of Company Common Stock, other than shares  of  Company Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), in respect  of the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be issued in the Merger and (ii)  any  cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(g) in lieu of fractional shares and  dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(h). Such  certificates
for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with the amount  of any  cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.7(g) in lieu of fractional shares and 
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(h) shall 
hereinafter be referred to as the " ** _Merger  Fund_**." With  respect to
the amount of cash to be deposited to satisfy its obligation  under  Section
1.7(g), Parent shall only be required to make a reasonable estimate  of  the
amount of such cash that will be necessary; provided, however, that  Parent 
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Paying Agent to agree to notify 
Parent  at any point when the amount of cash so paid to the Paying Agent to
satisfy  Parent\'s obligations pursuant to Section 1.7(g) reasonably appears
to be  inadequate, and Parent shall, upon receipt of such notice, timely
deliver  to the  Paying Agent such additional cash amounts as it may deem
reasonably necessary  for such purpose.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent  to mail  to each holder of record (as of the
Effective Time) of a Certificate that  immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares  of  Company Common Stock whose shares
were converted into the right to receive  the  Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 1.6(a), (i) a letter of  transmittal in customary form (which
shall specify that delivery shall  be  effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon  delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent and shall be in such form  and  have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and  (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in  exchange for receipt of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates  for cancellation to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as  may be  appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed  and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such  other 
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder  of
such  Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger  Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.6(a),  and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Until  so  surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and
after the  Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
ownership of  the  right to receive the Merger Consideration attributable
thereto.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  of Ownership_.  If any  portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than  the  Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificates are registered, it will  be a  condition of payment
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will  be  properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the  Persons  requesting such
payment will have paid to Parent or any agent designated  by it  any
transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.7) required by reason  of
the payment of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that  of the 
registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the 
satisfaction of Parent or Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is 
not  payable.

 

 

(d) _Required  Withholding_.  Each of  the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct  and  withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant  to  this Agreement
to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such  amounts as may
be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the  Code  or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any  other 
applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(c)). To the extent 
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated  for
the  purpose of Parent satisfying its obligation to deliver the Merger
Consideration  under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such amounts  would otherwise have been paid.

 

 

(e) _No  Liability_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, neither the  Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall  be  liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly  paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property,  escheat  or similar law.

 

 

(f) _Termination  of Merger Fund_.  Any  portion of the Merger Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof  and any shares of Parent
Common Stock) that remains undistributed to the  holders  of Certificates
180 days after the Effective Time shall, at the request  of the  instruction
of Parent, be delivered to Parent. Any holders of the Certificates  who have
not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this  Section 1.7 shall
after such delivery to Parent look only to Parent for  delivery of any shares
of Parent Common Stock and payment of any cash,  dividends  and other
distributions in respect thereof payable or deliverable pursuant  to 
Sections 1.6(a), 1.7(g) or 1.7(h), in each case without any interest 
thereon. Any such portion of the Merger Fund remaining unclaimed by holders 
of  shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts  would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity  (as  defined in Section 2.4) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal  Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims  or  interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 

(g) _Fractional  Shares_.  Any  other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, no fractional  shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued. Any holder of shares of  Company  Common Stock entitled to
receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock  but  for this Section
1.7(g) shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash  (without  interest)
determined by multiplying such fraction (rounded to the nearest  one-
hundredth of a share) by the average of the closing price of a share  of 
Parent Common Stock, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, New York City 
edition, for the five trading days ending on the trading day immediately 
prior  to the Effective Time.

 

 

(h) _Distributions  with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_.

 

 

(i) Whenever  a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in
respect of Parent  Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time,  that  declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of  all  shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends  or other distributions in respect
of such Parent Common Stock shall be  paid to  any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is  surrendered for exchange
in accordance with this Article I (or in compliance  with the provisions of
Section 1.9 of this Agreement, as applicable). Subject  to  the effect of
applicable Legal Requirements, following surrender of any  such 
Certificate, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates  representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor,  without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other  distributions with a record date at or after the
Effective Time and a payment  date on or prior to the date of issuance of
such whole shares of Parent  Common  Stock and not previously paid with
respect to such shares and (B) at the  appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable  with  respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date  at or  after the Effective Time
but with a payment date subsequent to  surrender.

 

 

(ii) After  the  Effective Time, registered holders of unsurrendered
Certificates shall  be  entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, any
meeting of Parent's stockholders  with a record date at or after the
Effective Time at any meeting of Parent's  stockholders with a record date at
or after the Effective Time the number  of  whole shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by such Certificates, as  the  case may be, regardless of
whether such holders have surrendered their  Certificates or delivered duly
executed transmittal materials.

 

 

1.8 _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_

 

 

.   All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for payment of shares 
of  Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed  to have  been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares  of  Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers  on  the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock.  If,  after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving  Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this Article I.

 

 

1.9 _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_

 

 

.   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the 
making of  an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required by Paying Agent, the
posting by such  Person  of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct,  as  indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to  such  Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen  or  destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration (including payment for  fractional shares set forth in
Section 1.7(g) hereof) to be paid in respect  of  the Shares represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this  Article I.

 

 

1.10 _Taking  of Necessary Action; Further Action_

 

 

.   If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary  or  desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to
vest the Surviving  Corporation with full right, title and possession to all
assets, property,  rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and
Merger Sub, the  officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub will take
all such lawful  and  necessary action. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform all of its  obligations relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated  hereby.

apparent based on the  substance  of such disclosure, such matter shall be
deemed to have been disclosed  in such  other section of the Company
Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding the  omission):

the ownership or leasing of its properties or operations  makes such

Material Adverse Effect on Company.

business as it is now  being  conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do  business  and is in good standing, or local law
equivalent, in each jurisdiction  in which  the nature of its business or
the ownership or leasing of its properties  or  operations makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than  in such  jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be  in good 
standing, or local law equivalent, would not reasonably be expected to  have
a  Material Adverse Effect on Company. Except as set forth on Part 2.5 of 
the  Company Disclosure Letter, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has  a  place of business or permanent establishment outside of the United
States.  Company has delivered, or made available to Parent true, correct and
complete  copies of the following documents: (i) the Articles of
Incorporation and  Bylaws (or similar organizational documents), in each case
as amended,  of each  Company Subsidiary, (ii) all the existing written
consents and minutes of  the meetings of the Boards of Directors of each
Company Subsidiary and  each  committee of such Boards of Directors, and
(iii) all the existing written  consents and minutes of the meetings of the
stockholders of each Company  Subsidiary.

 

 

(c) Except  as  set forth on Part 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither Company  nor any  Company Subsidiary owns any capital stock, any
equity or partnership interest,  any joint venture or profit sharing interest
or any other ownership or  proprietary interest in any Person.

 

 

2.6 _Company  SEC Reports;_ _  Compliance with OTCBB and NGM; Company
Financial Statements_.  

 

 

(a) Company  has filed on a timely basis all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and  other  documents required to be filed by Company with the
SEC since April 23,  2002 (the  " ** _Company  Commencement Date_** "), 
including all exhibits thereto and all certifications and statements
required  by  (x) Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act, or (y) 18
U.S.C.  Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) 
(collectively, the " ** _Certifications_** "),  as  such documents since the
time of filing may have been amended or supplemented  with the SEC (the " **
_Company  SEC Reports_** ").  Since  the Company Commencement Date, there
have been no comment letters or other  correspondence received by Company
from the SEC (excluding letters related  to  confidential treatment
applications and orders of effectiveness) or responses  to  such comment
letters or other correspondence by or on behalf of Company  that  have not
been provided to Parent, and the copies of such letters and responses 
delivered or made available to Parent were true, correct and complete. 
Company  maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15
or  15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and procedures are
designed  to  ensure that material information relating to Company,
including Company  Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in the reports it
files or submits  under  the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
Company's principal  executive officer and principal financial officer to
allow timely decisions  regarding financial disclosure. No Company Subsidiary
is required to file  with  the SEC any report, schedule, form, statement or
other document. As of  their  respective dates and except as subsequently
corrected by amendment, the  Company  SEC Reports and all other filings that
have been made by Company with the  SEC  complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities  Act or  the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and the rules and regulations of  the SEC  promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and Company  has  filed
all exhibits required to be filed with the Company SEC Reports and  all 
other filings that have been made by Company with the SEC, and all such 
exhibits  were true, correct and complete in all material respects (except to
the  extent  omissions were in reliance upon a confidential treatment
request). The  Company  SEC Reports and all other filings that have been
made by Company with the  SEC  (a) were and, in the case of Company SEC
Reports and all other filings with  the SEC filed by Company after the date
hereof, will be prepared in all  material  respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities  Act  and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and (b) did not at the time they  were filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof,  then on the date of such
filing), and in the case of such forms, reports  and  documents filed by
Company with the SEC after the date hereof, will not  as of  the time they
are filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact  or omit  to
state a material fact required to be stated in or necessary in order  to
make  the statements in such documents, in light of the circumstances under
which  they  were and will be made, not misleading; provided, however, that
all of the  Certifications are each true and correct based upon the knowledge
of the  officer(s) making such Certifications, as made. Company has filed all
amendments  to the Company SEC Reports and all other filings that have been
made by  Company  with the SEC as were required to be filed under applicable
law. Company  was in  compliance with the requirements applicable to
securities that are traded  on the  OTC Bulletin Board (the " ** _OTCBB_**
")  when  its securities were traded on the OTCBB and is in compliance with
the  requirements applicable to securities that are traded on the NGM and
has  not,  since the Company Commencement Date, received any notice from the
OTCBB  or the  NGM, asserting any non-compliance with such requirements. As
used in  Sections 2.6 and 3.6 hereof, the term " ** _file_** " shall  be
broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information 
is  furnished, supplied or otherwise made available in writing to the  SEC.

 

 

(b) Each  of  the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related  notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports,
including each Company  SEC  Report filed after the date hereof until the
Closing (the " ** _Company  Financials_** "),  (i) complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting  requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto then in
effect at the same time as such filing, (ii) was prepared  in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles  (" ** _GAAP_** ") 
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as  may
be  indicated therein or in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited 
interim  financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q,
8-K  or any  successor form under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly
presented in all  material respects the consolidated financial position of
Company and Company  Subsidiaries that are required by GAAP to be
consolidated therein and fairly  reflects its investment in any
unconsolidated Subsidiary as of the respective  dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash  flows  for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial  statements may not
contain footnotes and were or are subject to normal  and  recurring year-end
adjustments. All Subsidiaries of Company that are required  by  GAAP to be
consolidated in the Company Financials have been so consolidated.  The 
balance sheet of Company contained in Company SEC Reports as of June 30, 
2006 is  hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Company  Balance
Sheet_**." The  reserves reflected in the Company Financials have been
calculated in accordance  with GAAP. Except as disclosed in the Company
Balance Sheet, neither Company  nor  any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities required under GAAP to be set  forth  on a balance sheet
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) which are,  individually or in
the aggregate, material to the business, results of  operations or financial
condition of Company and Company Subsidiaries taken  as a  whole, except for
liabilities incurred since the date of the Company Balance  Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices  and  liabilities
incurred in connection with this Agreement. Neither Company  nor any 
Company Subsidiary nor, to Company's knowledge, any director, officer,
employee,  auditor, accountant or representative of Company or Company
Subsidiaries  has  received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
written complaint,  allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting
or auditing practices,  procedures, methodologies or methods of Company or
Company Subsidiaries  or their  respective internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation,  assertion or claim that Company or
Company Subsidiaries has engaged in  questionable accounting or auditing
practices; provided that if such event  arises after the date of this
Agreement, Company shall provide Parent with  prompt written notice of such
event. Part 2.6(b) of the Company Disclosure  Letter contains a description
of all non-audit services performed by Company's  auditors for Company and
Company Subsidiaries since January 1, 2006 **** and  the  fees paid for such
services. All such non-audit services were approved  as  required by Section
202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the  reasonable opinion of
Company's audit committee, the fees paid to and the  services performed by
Company's auditors relating to such non-audit services as  set forth on Part
2.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter do not impair  such auditor's
independence. Company has delivered or made available to Parent  true,
correct and complete copies of all policies, manuals and other documents 
promulgating Company's internal accounting controls. Since the Company 
Commencement Date, no attorney representing Company or any Company
Subsidiary,  whether or not employed by Company or Company Subsidiaries, has
reported  evidence of a violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary
duty or  similar  violation by Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents  to  Company's Board of Directors or any committee
thereof or to any director or  officer of Company; provided that if such
event arises after the date of  this  Agreement, Company shall provide
Parent with prompt written notice of such  event.

 

 

(c) Neither  Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment  to  become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement
or any similar  Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement  or  relationship between or among Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the  one  hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance,  special purpose or limited purpose Person, on the
other hand) where the  purpose  or intended effect of such arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material  transaction involving Company or any
Company Subsidiary in the Company  Financials.

.   Except as contemplated by this Agreement, since the date of the Company 
Balance  Sheet, Company and Company Subsidiaries have conducted their

foreign returns, estimates,  information statements and reports relating to
Taxes (" ** _Tax  Returns_** ")  required to be filed by or on behalf of

Returns are true, correct and complete in all  material respects. Company and
each Company Subsidiary have paid all Taxes  required to be paid.

is so qualified  or exempt  as applicable or (ii) an opinion letter from the
IRS as to the qualified  form of  its plan documents. No fact or event has
occurred or condition exists since  the  date of such determination letter
from the IRS which would be reasonably  likely  to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Plan or the  exempt  status of any such
trust and which cannot be corrected pursuant to IRS  Revenue  Procedure

Revenue Procedure), and to the extent such fact or event has occurred  or

Section 406 of ERISA  or  Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any
Company Plan. Neither Company  nor  any Company Subsidiary has incurred or
failed to pay any liability for  any  excise tax arising under Sections
4971, 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4978, 4979,  4980, 4980B, 4980D or 4980E of the
Code or any civil penalty arising under  Sections 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA,
and no fact, event or condition exists  which  could give rise to any such
liability. Neither Company nor any ERISA Affiliate  has incurred any
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title  IV of  ERISA and,
no fact, event or condition exists which could give rise to  any such 
liability. No complete or partial termination of an "employee pension
benefit  plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA has occurred
within the five  years preceding the date hereof with respect to any Company
Plan maintained  by  Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

accrued  with  respect to any Company Plan have been made, paid or accrued
on or before  their  due dates, including extensions thereof. All such
contributions have been  fully  deducted for income tax purposes and no such
deduction has been challenged  or  disallowed by any Governmental Entity and
no fact or event exists which  could  give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance.

compensation  plan  within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (i) such
Company Plan has  been  operated in good faith compliance with the

Company Plan has not been "materially  modified" (within the meaning of
Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the American Jobs  Creation Act of 2004 and any
applicable guidance issued thereunder) since  October 3, 2004, in a manner
which would cause amounts deferred in taxable  years  beginning before
January 1, 2005, under such plan to be subject to Section  409A  of the Code
if such plan was in existence prior to October 3, 2004, and  (iii) no  event
has occurred and no condition exists, that could subject any Person  to any 
tax, fine, penalty or other liability under Section 409A of the Code  (" **
_409A  Liability_** ").  None  of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement could, directly or  indirectly, subject any Person to any 409A
Liability.

 

 

(i) Except  as  set forth on Part 2.13(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter

at will, (b)  none of  the Company Plans, or any employment agreement or
other Contract to which  Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or
bound, (i) provides for  the  payment of or obligates Company or any Company
Subsidiary to pay separation,  severance, termination, as deferred
compensation, consulting, post termination  or similar type benefits to any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, alone or together  with
any  other event, (A) entitle any Person to bonus pay, golden parachute
payment,  severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment from
Company  or  any Company Subsidiary, (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting,  or  increase the amount of compensation or benefits due to any
such Person  from  Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (C) result in any
forgiveness of  indebtedness from Company or any Company Subsidiary.

its terms,  except  that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws,
now or hereafter in effect,  affecting creditors' rights generally, and (ii)
the remedy of specific  performance and injunctive and other forms of

(a) Parent  has filed on a timely basis all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and  other  documents required to be filed by Parent with the SEC
since January 1,  2005 (the  " ** _Parent  Commencement Date_** "), 
including all exhibits thereto and all Certifications, as such documents 
since  the time of filing may have been amended or supplemented with the SEC
(the  " ** _Parent  SEC Reports_** ").  For  Parent's Exchange Act
periodic report filings since the fourth quarter of 2005,  there have been no
comment letters or other correspondence received by  Parent  (excluding
letters related to confidential treatment applications and orders  of 
effectiveness) from the SEC or other correspondence by or on behalf of 
Parent to  the SEC that have not been provided to Company and the copies of
such letters  and responses delivered to or made available to Company were
true and complete  copies. Parent maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by  Rule  13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and
such controls and procedures  are  designed to ensure that material
information relating to Parent, including  Parent Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed in the reports it files or  submits  under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Parent's principal  executive officer and
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions  regarding financial
disclosure. No Parent Subsidiary is required to file  with  the SEC any
report, schedule, form, statement or other document. As of  their 
respective dates and except as subsequently corrected by amendment, the 
Parent  SEC Reports and all other filings that have been made by Parent with
the  SEC  complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities  Act or  the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of  the SEC  promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent
SEC Reports, and Parent  has  filed all exhibits required to be filed with
the Parent SEC Reports and  all  other filings that have been made by Parent
with the SEC, and all such  exhibits  were true, correct and complete in all
material respects (except to the  extent  omissions were in reliance upon a
confidential treatment request). The  Parent  SEC Reports and all other
filings that have been made by Parent with the  SEC (a)  were and, in the
case of Parent SEC Reports and all other filings with  the SEC  filed by
Parent after the date hereof, will be prepared in all material  respects  in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and  the 
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (b) did not at the time they were 
filed  (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof,
then  on the  date of such filing), and in the case of such forms, reports
and documents  filed  by Parent with the SEC after the date hereof, will not
as of the time they  are  filed, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  a  material fact required to be stated in or
necessary in order to make the  statements in such documents, in light of the
circumstances under which  they  were and will be made, not misleading;
provided, however, that all of the  Certifications are each true and correct
based upon the knowledge of the  officer(s) making such Certifications, as
made. Parent has filed all amendments  to the Parent SEC Reports and all
other filings that have been made by  Parent  with the SEC as were required
to be filed under applicable law. Parent  was in  material compliance with
the requirements applicable to securities that  are  traded on the American
Stock Exchange (the " ** _AMEX_** ")  when  its securities were traded on
the AMEX and is in material compliance with  the  requirements applicable to
securities that are traded on the NGM and has  not,  since the Parent
Commencement Date, received any notice from the AMEX or  the  NGM, asserting
any non compliance with such requirements.

 

 

(b) Each  of  the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any related  notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports,
including each Parent  SEC  Report filed after the date hereof until the
Closing (the " ** _Parent  Financials_** "),  (i)  complied as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting  requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect  thereto then in
effect at the same time as such filing, (ii) was prepared  in  accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods  involved
(except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto or,  in the 
case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by  the
SEC  on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act) and
(iii)  fairly  presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position  of Parent  and Parent Subsidiaries that are required by GAAP to be
consolidated therein  and  fairly reflects its investment in any
unconsolidated Subsidiary as of the  respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations  and  cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim  financial statements may not
contain footnotes and were or are subject  to normal  and recurring year-end
adjustments. All Subsidiaries of Parent that are  required  by GAAP to be
consolidated in the Parent Financials have been so consolidated.  The balance
sheet of Parent contained in Parent SEC Reports as of June  30, 2006  is
hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Parent  Balance Sheet_**." The 
reserves reflected in the Parent Financials have been calculated in
accordance  with GAAP. Except as disclosed in the Parent Balance Sheet,
neither Parent  nor  any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities required
under GAAP to be set  forth on  a balance sheet (absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise) which are,  individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business, results of  operations or financial condition of
Parent and Parent Subsidiaries taken  as a  whole, except for liabilities
incurred since the date of the Parent Balance  Sheet in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practices  and  liabilities incurred in
connection with this Agreement. Neither Parent  nor any  Parent Subsidiary
nor, to Parent's knowledge, any director, officer, employee,  auditor,
accountant or representative of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries  has  received
or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any written complaint,  allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, 
procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or Parent Subsidiaries or 
their  respective internal accounting controls, including any complaint,
allegation,  assertion or claim that Parent or Parent Subsidiaries has
engaged in  questionable accounting or auditing practices; provided that if
such event  arises after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall provide
Company with  prompt written notice of such event. Since the Parent
Commencement Date,  no  attorney representing Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, whether or not employed  by Parent or Parent Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a violation  of  securities laws, breach of fiduciary
duty or similar violation by Parent  or any  of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to Parent's Board of Directors  or any committee thereof
or to any director or officer of Parent; provided  that  if such event
arises after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall provide  Company with
prompt written notice of such event.

 

 

(c) Neither  Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to  become  a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement
or any similar Contract  (including any Contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship  between or among Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and  any  unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose  or  limited purpose Person, on the
other hand) where the purpose or intended  effect  of such arrangement is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction  involving  Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary in the Parent Financials.

 

 

3.6 _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_

 

 

.   Except as contemplated by this Agreement, since the date of the Parent

3.8 _Parent  Taxes_.

 

 

(a) Parent  and each Parent Subsidiary have timely filed, or caused to be
filed, taking  into  account any valid extensions of due dates, completely
and accurately, in  all  material respects, all Tax Returns required to be
filed by or on behalf  of  Parent and each Parent Subsidiary with any Tax
authority. Such Tax Returns  are  true, correct and complete in all material
respects. Parent and each Parent  Subsidiary have paid all Taxes due and
owing by Parent and each Parent  Subsidiary.

 

 

(b) Parent  and Parent Subsidiaries have collected all sales, use, goods and
services  or  other commodity Taxes required to be collected and remitted or
will remit  the  same to the appropriate Tax authority within the prescribed
time periods.  Parent  and each Parent Subsidiary have timely withheld or
paid all federal and  state  income Taxes, Taxes pursuant to the FICA, Taxes
pursuant to the Federal  Unemployment Tax Act and other Taxes required to be
withheld or paid by  Parent  and each Parent Subsidiary with respect to any
of their respective employees,  former employees, directors, officers,
residents and non-residents or third  parties.

 

 

(c) There  is  no Tax deficiency outstanding, proposed or assessed against

the period for the  assessment or collection of any Tax.

 

 

(d) No  examination of any Tax Return of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is

received written  notice of any (i) pending or proposed audit or examination,
(ii) request  for  information regarding Tax matters, or (iii) notice of
deficiency or prepared  adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted,
or assessed by any  Tax  authority against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,

since the date of the  Parent  Balance Sheet in connection with the
operation of the business of Parent  and  Parent Subsidiaries in the
ordinary course. The amount set up as an accrual  for  Taxes (aside from any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect  timing  differences
between book and tax income) in the Parent Balance Sheet is  sufficient for
the payment of all unpaid Taxes of Parent and any Parent  Subsidiary, whether
or not disputed, for all periods ended on or prior  to the  date hereof.

no Encumbrances  on  the assets of Parent relating to or attributable to
Taxes other than  Encumbrances for Taxes not yet due and payable. There is no
basis for the  assertion of any claim relating or attributable to Taxes that,
if adversely  determined, would result in any Encumbrance for Taxes on the
assets of  Parent.

to the  knowledge of Parent, any investigation, inquiry or subpoena by) any
Governmental  Entity, pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent  or any  Parent Subsidiary with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions  contemplated hereby, or otherwise against (or, to the
knowledge of Parent,  affecting) Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or their

internal investigations or inquiries being  conducted by Parent, Parent
Subsidiaries, their respective Boards of Directors  or other equivalent
management bodies or any third party or Governmental  Entity  or at the
request of any of the foregoing concerning any financial, accounting,  Tax,
conflict of interest, self dealing, fraudulent or deceptive conduct  or 
other misfeasance or malfeasance matters.

rights (excluding Intellectual Property  Rights, which are addressed

which they are presently being used, except for instances that would not

case where the failure to so comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect 
with respect to Parent. No investigation or review by any Governmental 
Entity  (other than any taxing authority) is pending or, to Parent's
knowledge, has been  threatened against Parent or Parent Subsidiaries in a
writing delivered  to  Parent.

Hazardous Materials  at,  from, in, to, on or under any real properties
currently or previously owned,  leased, or utilized by Parent or any Parent

expected to form the basis of any  Environmental Claim against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary.

the Merger would otherwise be consummated in the  absence  of such
requirement.

proxy materials  relating to the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent

expenses incident thereto.

 

 

(b) Each  of  Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning
such Person  to the  other as may be reasonably requested in connection with

and  at the times of the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent
Stockholders  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating  to  the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or  directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
(i) should  be set  forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that  the  Joint Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material  fact  or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary  in  order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under  which  they are made, not misleading or
(ii) should be set forth in an amendment  or  supplement to the Registration
Statement, so that the Registration Statement  shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state  any  material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify  the  other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing  such 
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by 
applicable Legal Requirements, disseminated to the stockholders of Company 
and  Parent.

 

 

(d) As  promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of
Company  and  Parent will prepare and file any filings required to be filed
by any other  federal, state or foreign laws relating to the Merger and the

notify the other promptly (i) upon the occurrence of any event which is 
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any Filing,  (ii)
upon the receipt of any comments from any Governmental Entity in  connection
with any Filing, and (iii) upon any request by any Governmental  Entity for
amendments or supplements to any Filings or for additional  information. Each
of Company and Parent shall supply the other with copies  of  all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on  the
one  hand, and a Governmental Entity, on the other hand, with respect to
any  Filing.  Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements (i)

taking a  position  with respect to any Filing, shall permit the other party
to review and  discuss  in advance, and consider in good faith the views of
such other party in  connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs,  white papers, arguments, opinions and
proposals before making or submitting  any  of the foregoing to any
Governmental Entity in connection with any  investigations or proceedings in
connection with any Filing, and (ii) each  of Company and Parent shall
coordinate with the other party in preparing  and  exchanging such
information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel)  with copies of
all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary  of any  oral
presentations) made by such party with any Governmental Entity in  connection
with any Filing; _provided_ _that_   with  respect to any such filing,
presentation or submission, each of Parent  and  Company need not supply the
other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case  of  oral presentations, a
summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule  or  regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires  such  party or its
subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties  or
information or where such properties or information is subject to the 
attorney-client privilege (it being understood that the participation and 
cooperation contemplated herein is not intended to constitute, nor shall 
be  deemed to constitute, any form of direct or indirect waiver of the 
attorney-client privilege maintained by any party hereto). Each of Company 
and  Parent will cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with 
any  Governmental Entity under this Section 5.1(d) to comply in all
material  respects  with all applicable Legal Requirements.

notice (or such  lesser prior notice as provided to the members of Company's
Board of Directors)  of any meeting of Company's Board of Directors at which
Company's Board of  Directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal to  determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal;

 

 

(ii) a  Superior Proposal (as defined below) is made to Company and is not 
withdrawn;

Meeting have not  occurred; _provided_ ,  _however_   that if  either

purposes  of this clause (iii);

 

 

(iv) Company  shall have provided written notice to Parent (a " ** _Notice 
of Superior Proposal_** ")  advising Parent that Company has received a

(vii) the  Board  of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with  its  outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal and any  offer  made by Parent pursuant to Section

breach of its fiduciary obligations to Company's  stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; and

 

 

(viii) Company  shall have complied in all material respects with Sections
5.1,  5.2  and 5.3.

Change of Recommendation).  Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders for a vote any  Acquisition Proposal or propose or agree to do
so at or prior to the Company  Stockholders Meeting.

mean a bona fide binding written offer that has not been solicited by the 
Company following the date of this Agreement and is made by a Person to

proposal and this Agreement (including  any  proposal by either party to
amend the terms of this Agreement) and the  Person  making the offer, and
(ii) reasonably capable of being consummated;  _provided,  however_ , 
that  any such offer shall not be deemed to be a Superior Proposal if any
financing  required to consummate the transaction contemplated by such offer
is not  committed or if there is a general due diligence condition to the
parties' obligations to consummate the transaction that is the subject of the
Superior  Proposal.

 

 

(f) Nothing  contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its Board
of Directors  from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by  Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;

its subsidiaries or  any  tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any  Person or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act and the rules  and regulations thereunder) beneficially
owning 15% or more of the total  outstanding voting securities of Company or
any of its subsidiaries or  any  merger, consolidation, business combination
or similar transaction involving  Company pursuant to which the stockholders
of Company immediately preceding  such  transaction hold less than 85% of

disposition by Company of assets representing in excess of 50% of the
aggregate  fair market value of Company's business immediately prior to such
