community property and homestead rights in a Property, and the failure to record releases of

Property, a Company or the ability of the Companies or their Affiliates to own, operate,

Deficiency&#148; shall exist if (i)&nbsp;the Companies are obligated to bear and pay costs and expenses
associated with the exploration, maintenance, development and operation of any Property through the
plugging, abandonment, and salvage of such Property greater than the working interest for such
Property represented in the Property Letter without a corresponding increase in the applicable net
revenue interest in such Property represented in the Property Letter, (ii)&nbsp;the Companies are
entitled to receive and retain a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved, and marketed from any
Property without suspension, reduction or termination through the plugging, abandonment, and
salvage of such Property less than the net revenue interest for that Property represented in the
Property Letter, (iii)&nbsp;any Property is subject to a Claim (other than a Permitted Encumbrance),
(iv)&nbsp;any Property is subject to a preferential purchase right, right of first offer, right of first
refusal or consent, the absence of which would render the Transactions void or voidable or subject
any Company to potential loss of any Property or any interest therein or to damages or penalties
upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Person holding the interest in such Property or
any similar purchase or consent right, in each case that would be triggered or would otherwise
arise as a result of the consummation of the sale and delivery of the Shares by Sellers to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, or (v)&nbsp;any combination of the foregoing exist. Purchase
shall have the right to notify Sellers in writing of any Title Deficiencies (a &#147;Title Deficiency
Notice&#148;) no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on the fourth business day prior to the Closing
Date. Any Title Deficiency Notice shall include Purchaser&#146;s good faith determination based on
customary industry standards of the dollar value of such Title Deficiency, which value shall be
determined based upon the relative change in the Maximum Title Deficiency Amount of such Property
(each, a &#147;Title Deficiency Amount&#148;). By way of illustration: (i)&nbsp;if a Company&#146;s actual net
revenue interest in a Property is less than the net revenue interest set forth for such Property in
the Property Letter or if a Company&#146;s actual working interest in a Property is greater than the
working interest set forth in the Property Letter (without a corresponding increase in a Company&#146;s
net revenue interest), then value of the Title Deficiency would be that portion of the Maximum
Title Deficiency Amount represented by the relative difference between the actual net revenue
interest or working interest in the property and the net revenue interest or working interest for
such Property in the Property Letter; or (ii)&nbsp;if a Title Deficiency is a lien, then the value of
the Title Deficiency would be the cost of removing the lien. Furthermore, in the event of any
Title Deficiency described in clause (iv)&nbsp;above, the value of any such Title Deficiency shall be
the Maximum Title Deficiency Amount of the Property subject to such purchase or consent right. Any
reduction in the value of any Property due to a Title Deficiency shall be included in the
calculation for determining whether the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
2.6. No adjustment to the Purchase Price will be made for any Title Deficiency. Purchaser agrees
to notify the Agent as soon as reasonably practicable following its determination of a Title
Deficiency in order to provide Sellers the reasonable opportunity to provide Purchaser with
additional records or additional information that could resolve or reduce the value of such Title
Deficiency. Purchaser acknowledges that certain Properties are subject to certain liens for the
benefit of J.P.Morgan Chase Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, which liens shall not be considered Title
Deficiencies so long as such liens are released as of the Closing.

the Closing Date, it or one of its Affiliates (including the Companies) will offer to continue the
employment of each Retained Employee in the same city of their employment as of immediately prior
to the date of this Agreement at a position performing generally similar work activities and job
function. The parties acknowledge that the overall job responsibilities of a Retained Employee may
be adjusted from time to time during such two year period based upon the organizational and
operating structure of Purchaser and its Affiliates and based upon the overall job performance and
capabilities of the Retained Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates shall have the right during such two-year period to terminate the employment of any
Retained Employee. In the event that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates terminates the employment
of a Retained Employee during the two-year period following the Closing Date for any reason other
than for cause (as such term is defined in the Employee Letter Agreement), Purchaser agrees (i)&nbsp;to
pay to such terminated Retained Employee, in a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes
and subject to any deferral of the time of payment necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section
409(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code), (A)&nbsp;the amount of the base salary or wages, if any, that would have
otherwise been owed to such Retained Employee from the date of termination of employment until the
second anniversary of the Closing Date and (B)&nbsp;any portion of the Cash Bonus that has not yet been
paid and (ii)&nbsp;to provide, from the date of termination until the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, such terminated Retained Employee with medical benefits consistent with those provided to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates who have not terminated employment.
In the event that the employment of a Retained Employee is terminated due to death or disability
(as such term is defined in the Employee Letter Agreement), Purchaser agrees to pay to such
Retained Employee, in a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes and subject to any
deferral of the time of payment necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section&nbsp;409(a)(2)(B)(i) of
the Code) any portion of the Cash Bonus that has not yet been paid. Each Retained Employee shall
be provided with substantially similar benefits afforded to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and its Affiliates; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that in no event shall the base
salary or base wage, as applicable, of a Retained Employee be less than the base salary or base
wage, as applicable, of such Retained Employee in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement, except to the extent of any salary reduction generally applicable to all employees of
Purchaser. Accrued and unused vacation and sick leave of each Retained Employee shall be honored
by Purchaser and all seniority and vesting earned by such Retained Employee prior to the Closing
Date and recognized by the Companies shall be credited by Purchaser to the extent applicable under
Purchaser&#146;s employee benefit plans for eligibility and vesting purposes and for benefit
determination purposes under any applicable vacation, sick leave, or severance benefit program, and
Purchaser shall approve any amendments necessary of Purchaser&#146;s employee benefit plans to give

unless shareholder approval of such payments is obtained in a manner that satisfies the
requirements of Section&nbsp;280G(b)(5) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

terms of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, and accordingly agree that, in addition to other remedies, any non-breaching party
shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages or posting any bond.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not be entitled to seek specific performance in
the event that Purchaser pays the Reverse Break Fee under the circumstances described in Section
6.2.

of this Agreement, the action shall be commenced in the State of Texas in Midland County. Each
party agrees to the waiver of a trial by jury and that the prevailing party&#146;s legal costs,
including attorney&#146;s fees, will be paid by the non-prevailing party; <U>provided</U>, the
determination of the prevailing party shall be made from the totality of all circumstances and is
not required to be the party in whose favor judgment has been rendered.

was negotiated fairly between them at arms&#146; length and that the final terms of this Agreement are
the product of the parties&#146; negotiations. Each party represents and warrants that it has sought
and received legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties agree that this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement
therefore should not be construed against a party or parties on the grounds that any party or
