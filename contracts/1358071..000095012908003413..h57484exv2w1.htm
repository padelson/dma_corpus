 Section 2.3 _Bonus Payments_. 

   

 (a) Immediately prior to Closing, Henry Petroleum will approve payment of (i) a cash bonus to certain employees of Henry Petroleum in accordance with existing bonus commitments to such employees as set forth under the heading "Prior Bonus" on the Compensation Letter (the "Prior Bonus"); (ii) cash bonuses, pursuant to an Employee Letter Agreement, to employees of Henry Petroleum identified on the Compensation Letter, subject to such employees executing and delivering to Henry Petroleum prior to Closing an Employee Letter Agreement and such employees continuing their employment with Henry Petroleum or Purchaser (or any Affiliate of Purchaser) after the Closing Date (the "Retained Employees"), the amount payable to each Retained Employee being set forth in the Compensation Letter under the heading "Cash Bonus" (the "Cash Bonus") and (iii) payment to certain independent contractors of Henry Petroleum identified in the Compensation Letter, subject to such independent contractors executing and delivering to Henry Petroleum prior to Closing a release in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, the amount payable to each such independent contractor who executes a release being set forth in the Compensation Letter under the heading "Contractor Bonus" (the "Contractor Bonus"). Payment by Henry Petroleum of the Prior Bonus and the Cash Bonus shall all be subject to applicable withholding Taxes. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Cash Bonus Adjustment, which is calculated as follows: the product of (i) the sum of the Prior Bonus plus the Cash Bonus plus the Contractor Bonus and (ii) 65%. With respect to any employee of Henry Petroleum identified in the Compensation Letter who is intended to receive a Cash Bonus and who does not execute and deliver to Henry Petroleum the Employee Letter Agreement prior to Closing and any independent contractor of Henry Petroleum identified in the Compensation Letter who does not execute and deliver to Henry Petroleum the release contemplated in Section 2.3(a) prior to Closing, such employee or independent contractor shall not be entitled to receive the Cash Bonus or the Contractor Bonus, as the case may be, and an amount equal to the product of (A) the amount of any such Cash Bonus and Contractor Bonus not paid pursuant to the foregoing and (B) 65%, shall be paid to Sellers at Closing as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (such amount being referred to as the "Purchase Price Adjustment"). 

   

 (c) The Prior Bonus shall be paid by Henry Petroleum immediately prior to the Closing to the employees and in the amounts set forth in the Compensation Letter, provided that such individuals are employed by Henry Petroleum at the time of such payment. The Contractor Bonus shall be paid by Henry Petroleum immediately prior to Closing to the independent contractors who execute and deliver a release in accordance with Section 2.3(a) in the amounts set forth in the Compensation Letter, provided that such independent contractors are then engaged by Henry Petroleum at the time of such payment. The Cash Bonus will be paid by Henry Petroleum to each Retained Employee in installments pursuant to an Employee Letter Agreement 

   ##### 

  

    

executed by the Retained Employee that will be delivered to Henry Petroleum
prior to Closing as follows: (1) 50% to be paid by Henry Petroleum
immediately prior to Closing, provided that such individuals are employed by
Henry Petroleum at the time of such payment (the "First Bonus Installment");
(2) 25% to be paid by Henry Petroleum (or Concho or its Affiliates) on the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, assuming satisfaction of the terms of
the Employee Letter Agreement; and (3) 25% to be paid by Henry Petroleum (or
Concho or its Affiliates) on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
assuming satisfaction of the terms of the Employee Letter Agreement. Under
the terms of each Employee Letter Agreement, each Retained Employee will
agree to forfeit any unpaid portion of the Cash Bonus in the event that such
Retained Employees employment with Henry Petroleum (or its successor)
or Purchaser (or any Affiliate of Purchaser) is terminated for cause (as
defined in the Employee Letter Agreement) or such Retained Employee
terminates his own employment for any reason. In addition, under the terms of
each Employee Letter Agreement, each Retained Employee will be entitled to
receive the full amount of the unpaid Cash Bonus allocated to such Retained
Employee in the event of the death or disability (as such term is defined
in the Employee Letter Agreement) of such Retained Employee or change in
control of Purchaser (as such term is defined in the Employee Letter
Agreement) or in the event that such Retained Employees employment with
Henry Petroleum (or its successor) or Purchaser (or any Affiliate of
Purchaser) is terminated by Henry Petroleum (or its successor) or Purchaser
(or any Affiliate of Purchaser) for any reason other than for cause (as
defined in the Employee Letter Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to any portion of the Cash Bonus payable to a Retained Employee in
connection with any such termination of employment, the payment of such
amount shall be deferred to the extent required to satisfy the requirements
of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. Within ten business days following
the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers
an amount (the "Cash Bonus Return") equal to the product of (i) any unpaid
portion of the Cash Bonus as a result of any forfeitures in accordance with
the terms of the Employee Letter Agreement and (ii) 65%; _provided_ _,_
_however_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated to include in such
calculation any unpaid portion of the Cash Bonus with respect to a Retained
Employee who was employed by any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller
after the Closing Date in violation of Section 4.12(b). Each Seller shall be
entitled to receive an amount equal to such Sellers Ownership Percentage
multiplied by the Cash Bonus Return. For federal income tax purposes, the
parties shall treat the Cash Bonus Return as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. 

   

 (d) The Prior Bonus, the First Bonus Installment and the Contractor Bonus will be paid by the distribution and delivery of checks payable to the Retained Employees and drawn on accounts of Henry Petroleum. To the extent necessary, Purchaser shall advance sufficient funds by wire transfer to enable Henry Petroleum to timely pay the Prior Bonus, the First Bonus Installment and the Contractor Bonus and related employment Taxes. 

   

 (e) For all applicable Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat (i) the Prior Bonus, the First Bonus Installment and the Contractor Bonus as compensation paid by Henry Petroleum for the Tax Period that includes the Closing Date, and (ii) any subsequent payments of installments of the Cash Bonus as employee compensation paid by Henry Petroleum or any successor thereto in future Tax Periods. The parties shall report and file all Tax Returns consistent with this position and shall take no applicable Tax position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith prior to a final determination in court or by agreement with an applicable Governmental Authority after consultation with the other parties. 

  

 Section 2.4 _Title Deficiency_. Purchaser may make or cause to be made at its expense such examination as it may desire of the title of a Company to the Properties. For such purposes, Sellers shall or shall cause the Companies to (a) give to Purchaser and its representatives full access, subject to consent 

   ##### 

  

 

under applicable Contracts, at any reasonable time to all of the files,
records, contracts, correspondence, computer output and data files, maps,
data, reports, plats, abstracts of title, lease files, well files, unit
files, division order files, production marketing files, title opinions,
title files and title records, title insurance policies, ownership maps,
surveys, and any other information, data, records, and files of each Company
(or to which any Company has access) relating in any way to the title to the
Properties, the past or present operation thereof, and the marketing of
production therefrom; (b) furnish to Purchaser all other information in the
possession of, or available to, any Company with respect to the title to the
Properties as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request; and (c)
authorize Purchaser and its representatives to consult with attorneys,
abstract companies, and representatives of the Companies, whether utilized in
the past or presently, concerning title-related matters with respect to the
Properties. A "Title Deficiency" shall exist if (i) the Companies are
obligated to bear and pay costs and expenses associated with the exploration,
maintenance, development and operation of any Property through the plugging,
abandonment, and salvage of such Property greater than the working interest
for such Property represented in the Property Letter without a corresponding
increase in the applicable net revenue interest in such Property represented
in the Property Letter, (ii) the Companies are entitled to receive and retain
a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved, and marketed from any Property
without suspension, reduction or termination through the plugging,
abandonment, and salvage of such Property less than the net revenue interest
for that Property represented in the Property Letter, (iii) any Property is
subject to a Claim (other than a Permitted Encumbrance), (iv) any Property is
subject to a preferential purchase right, right of first offer, right of
first refusal or consent, the absence of which would render the Transactions
void or voidable or subject any Company to potential loss of any Property or
any interest therein or to damages or penalties upon the occurrence of a
change of control of the Person holding the interest in such Property or any
similar purchase or consent right, in each case that would be triggered or
would otherwise arise as a result of the consummation of the sale and
delivery of the Shares by Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, or
(v) any combination of the foregoing exist. Purchase shall have the right to
notify Sellers in writing of any Title Deficiencies (a "Title
Deficiency Notice") no later than 5:00 p.m. (Central time) on the fourth
business day prior to the Closing Date. Any Title Deficiency Notice shall
include Purchasers good faith determination based on customary industry
standards of the dollar value of such Title Deficiency, which value shall
be determined based upon the relative change in the Maximum Title Deficiency
Amount of such Property (each, a "Title Deficiency Amount"). By way of
illustration: (i) if a Companys actual net revenue interest in a Property is
less than the net revenue interest set forth for such Property in the
Property Letter or if a Companys actual working interest in a Property is
greater than the working interest set forth in the Property Letter (without a
corresponding increase in a Companys net revenue interest), then value of
the Title Deficiency would be that portion of the Maximum Title Deficiency
Amount represented by the relative difference between the actual net
revenue interest or working interest in the property and the net revenue
interest or working interest for such Property in the Property Letter; or
(ii) if a Title Deficiency is a lien, then the value of the Title Deficiency
would be the cost of removing the lien. Furthermore, in the event of
any Title Deficiency described in clause (iv) above, the value of any such
Title Deficiency shall be the Maximum Title Deficiency Amount of the Property
subject to such purchase or consent right. Any reduction in the value of any
Property due to a Title Deficiency shall be included in the calculation for
determining whether the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 2.6. No adjustment to the Purchase Price will be made for any Title
Deficiency. Purchaser agrees to notify the Agent as soon as reasonably
practicable following its determination of a Title Deficiency in order to
provide Sellers the reasonable opportunity to provide Purchaser
with additional records or additional information that could resolve or
reduce the value of such Title Deficiency. Purchaser acknowledges that
certain Properties are subject to certain liens for the benefit of J.P.Morgan
Chase Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, which liens shall not be considered
Title Deficiencies so long as such liens are released as of the Closing. 

   

 Section 2.5 _Property Condition Deficiency_. Commencing upon execution of this Agreement and ending at 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the fourth business day prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be entitled to inspect, review and evaluate all records, facilities, and
Properties of each Company, interview Company personnel, and perform such
environmental sampling and testing as may be appropriate to enable the
Purchaser to assess the environmental and physical condition of the
Properties and the environmental liabilities of each Company. The purpose of
the inspection of the physical condition of the Properties shall be to
confirm that they are maintained in accordance with the legal and contractual
obligations of the Companies. Purchaser shall use reasonable care not to
damage the Properties during the course of its inspections pursuant to this
Section 2.5. Based on its review and inspection, Purchaser shall in good
faith determine whether the value of a Property could reasonably be expected
to be impaired because (i) of property condition issues (including any
pollution, contamination, remedial obligation, or liability under any
Environmental Law), (ii) any Property or Company is in violation of any
Environmental Law, (iii) of any written notice or record from a Governmental
Authority or other Person of a violation of Environmental Laws or a Contract
with regard to any property condition the Companies are contractually or
legally obligated to remedy, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing (any, a
"Property Condition Deficiency"). The Purchaser shall determine in good faith
based on customary industry standards the dollar amount that a Property could
reasonably be expected to be impaired based on the amount reasonably
necessary to remedy any violation(s) of Environmental Law, to bring the
Property into compliance with applicable Environmental Laws or to restore a
Property to its contractually required condition (each, a "Property Condition
Deficiency Amount"). The Purchaser shall determine the total dollar value
reduction of all Property Condition Deficiencies. The dollar value of
any impairment of any Property due to a Property Condition Deficiency shall
be included in the calculation for determining whether the Purchaser may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.6. No adjustment to the
Purchase Price will be made for any Property Condition Deficiency. 

   

 Section 2.6 _Termination Due to Deficiencies_. If the aggregate Title Deficiency Amounts plus the aggregate Property Condition Deficiency Amounts, as determined in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 above, exceed $16,950,000.00, then Purchaser, at its election, may give written notice to Sellers not later than 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the fourth business day prior to the Closing Date (the "Deficiency Notice"). 

   

 (a) The Deficiency Notice provided hereunder, if given, shall include (i) a description of each Title Deficiency or Property Condition Deficiency, (ii) the basis for each Title Deficiency or Property Condition Deficiency, (iii) each Property or the portion thereof affected by the Title Deficiency or Property Condition Deficiency, (iv) each Title Deficiency Amount or Property Condition Deficiency Amount and (v) with respect to each Title Deficiency Amount, the applicable Company owning the Property subject to such Title Deficiency Amount. 

   

 (b) Sellers may accept Purchasers Deficiency Notice or object thereto. If the Sellers object to certain Property Condition Deficiency Amounts set forth in the Deficiency Notice that, if reduced, could reasonably be expected to reduce the aggregate Title Deficiency Amounts and Property Condition Deficiency Amounts below $16,950,000.00, the Sellers shall deliver a written notice of such objection (the "Dispute Notice") to Purchaser no later than 5:00 p.m. on the third business day after the date of the Deficiency Notice. If the Dispute Notice is not delivered by 5:00 p.m. on the third business day after the date of the Deficiency Notice, Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(g). Upon delivery of a Dispute Notice to Purchaser, the Termination Date and the Closing Date shall automatically be extended from July 31, 2008 to August 31, 2008. Within seven (7) business days after the date of the Dispute Notice, Sellers shall deliver a more detailed written notice (the "Dispute Explanation"), which shall specifically identify all disputed Property Condition Deficiency Amounts (each, a "Disputed Item") and shall include the Sellers good faith estimate of the value of each Disputed Item (each, a "Sellers Estimate");  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Disputed Item shall be permitted to be included in the Dispute Explanation if the Sellers Estimate of such Disputed Item would be greater than 90% of such Property Condition Deficiency Amount. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (c) After delivery of the Dispute Explanation, the parties shall promptly refer the Disputed Items to a person selected by mutual agreement of the parties who possesses the requisite knowledge, skill and experience to determine the issue (the "Defect Expert"). The Defect Expert may enlist the advice of any environmental consultant mutually agreed upon by the parties. 

   

 (d) Upon referral of the Disputed Items to the Defect Expert, the Purchaser and the Sellers will be afforded an opportunity to present to the Defect Expert any materials relating to the validity of, or their valuation of, the Disputed Items and to discuss the determination, prior to any final determination, of the Disputed Items with the Defect Expert. The Defect Expert shall be required to adopt a value (the "Determined Amount") that is equal to either the Property Condition Deficiency Amount or the Sellers Estimate for each Disputed Item, and such decision, made in writing and signed by the Defect Expert, shall determine such dispute. 

   

 (e) If, after determination of the Determined Amount for each Disputed Item by the Defect Expert, the sum of (i) all Title Deficiency Amounts, (ii) all Property Condition Deficiency Amounts for Property Condition Deficiencies not included in the Dispute Explanation and (iii) all Determined Amounts (such sum, the "Adjusted Defect Amount") exceeds $16,950,000.00, then Sellers shall bear all expenses of the Defect Expert and any other expert retained by the Defect Expert. If the Adjusted Defect Amount is less than or equal to $16,950,000.00, then Purchaser shall bear all expenses of the Defect Expert and any other expert retained by the Defect Expert. 

   

 (f) In the event that Purchaser does not deliver a timely Deficiency Notice pursuant to this Section 2.6 or the aggregate of the Title Deficiency Amounts and the Property Condition Deficiency Amounts is ultimately determined to be less than $16,950,000.00, then Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(g). In the event that Purchaser does deliver a timely Deficiency Notice pursuant to this Section 2.6 and either Sellers do not deliver a timely Dispute Notice or Sellers do deliver a timely Dispute Notice but the aggregate of the Title Deficiency Amounts and the Property Condition Deficiency Amounts is ultimately determined to be equal to or greater than $16,950,000.00, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(g). After Purchaser completes its due diligence under Sections 2.4 and 2.5, if Purchaser proceeds to the Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Properties and shall have no claim for indemnification from the Sellers for defects, damages, costs or other liabilities for items that would have been a Title Deficiency or a Property Condition Deficiency. 

  

 Section 2.7 _Along-side Interests_. Within five (5) business days of the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser will offer to purchase the rights and interests in the Properties ("Along-side Interests") owned by the Persons listed on _Schedule 2.7_ for the prices shown on such Schedule pursuant to the form of purchase agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B. None of the Persons listed on _Schedule 2.7_ will be obligated to sell their Along-side Interests. Purchaser or its Affiliate and those Persons who accept Purchasers offer shall promptly sign binding agreements for the purchase and sale of the Along-side Interests. If Purchasers offer is accepted by a Designated Seller, Purchaser must close the purchase of the Along-side Interest simultaneously with the Closing, with payment of the purchase price for the Along-side Interest paid in cash by wire transfer to such Designated Seller as directed by such Designated Seller. If the owner of the Along-side Interest is a Person other than a Designated Seller, Purchaser must close the purchase of the Along-side Interests of such Person who accepts the Purchasers offer no later than 90 days after Closing, by payment of the purchase price pursuant to the purchase agreement for the Along-side Interests purchased in cash by wire transfer to the account designated by the respective seller.

At or prior to Closing, Holding and Energy intend to make a direct or indirect distribution of the Excluded Companies to the Sellers containing certain properties which are either presently owned by the Excluded Companies or which will be contributed to the Excluded Companies immediately before the distribution of the Excluded Companies. _Schedule 2.8(a)_ lists the properties and assets that will be owned by Henry Resources LLC with their respective values immediately prior to the distribution of Henry Resources LLC by Holding ("Henry Holding Distribution"). _Schedule 2.8(b)_ lists the properties and assets that will be owned by Henry Equity LLC immediately prior to the distribution of Henry Equity LLC by Energy (the "Henry Energy Distribution") with their respective values. The Sellers shall consult with Purchaser as to the structure, method and status of the Henry Holding Distribution and the Henry Energy Distribution and related matters. The parties shall report and file all Tax Returns consistent with such values. 

  

 Section 2.9 _Agreed Net Working Capital Distribution_.

Except as provided in Section 2.3, none of the Companies is a party to any agreement, nor has any Company established any policy or practice, requiring it to make a payment or provide any other form of compensation or benefit to any person performing services for a Company upon termination of such services that would not be payable or provided in the absence of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (t) not engage in any line of business in which it is not engaged as of the date hereof; nor enter into, or otherwise be a party to, any Contract relating to the voting, registration or transfer of any Shares or other securities of any Company. 

  

 Section 4.2 _HSR Filing_. The Sellers and Purchaser shall file, if required, or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the Transactions. The Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly consult as to the appropriate time of filing such notifications and shall use their best efforts to make such filings at the agreed upon time, to respond promptly to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing. All filing fees shall be shared equally by Purchaser on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. 

  

 Section 4.3 _Access to Information_.

   ##### 

  

 

Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the business of such Company.
Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement,
each Seller and each Company makes no warranty or representation of any kind
as to the books and records or any information contained therein or the
completeness thereof. Purchaser agrees that any conclusions drawn from the
books and records shall be the result of its own independent review and
judgment. From the Closing Date for a period of three (3) years thereafter,
Purchaser will provide Sellers with reasonable access during regular
business hours to inspect and/or copy all books, records, operating data and
other information generated or obtained by the Companies prior to the Closing
Date and pertaining to the operation of the Companies, as may be reasonably
necessary for the Sellers to conduct or tend to their business affairs. 

   

 Section 4.4 _Cooperation in Connection with Regulatory Filings_. From and after the date hereof, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies and their respective Affiliates and advisors and representatives to, provide reasonable cooperation, at Purchasers expense, to Purchaser, its Affiliates and their representatives in connection with any regulatory filings, tax filings, other filings with any Governmental Authority and filings that may be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including the filing by Purchaser with the SEC of one or more registration statements to register any securities of Purchaser under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or of any report required to be filed by Purchaser under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act", and together with the Securities Act, the "Securities Laws") (collectively, the "Filings"). Further, from and after the date hereof, the Sellers agree to make available to Purchaser and its Affiliates and their representatives any and all books, records, information and documents that are related to the Companies and are in Sellers or their Affiliates possession reasonably required by Purchaser, its Affiliates and their representatives in order to prepare for Purchaser or its Affiliates, if required, in connection with such Filings, financial statements of the Companies meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, along with any documentation attributable to the Companies required to complete any audit associated with such financial statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall, and shall cause their employees, consultants and Affiliates to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the independent auditors chosen by Purchaser ("Purchasers Auditor") in connection with any audit by Purchasers Auditor of any financial statements, balance sheet and statement of cash flows of the Companies that Purchaser requires to comply with the requirements of the Securities Laws with respect to any Filings. Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers and/or the Companies for all costs incurred by any of them in assisting Purchaser, its representatives and Purchasers Auditor. 

  

 Section 4.5 _Consent from Third Parties_. Each Seller and each Company will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to acquire the written consent from all third parties to Contracts with respect to which the consummation of the Transactions or the compliance with this Agreement, could reasonably be expected to result in, or cause a default, or constitute an event of default (or an event which the giving of notice or the passage of time could cause a default or event of default), or otherwise cause any Company to be in breach of, or unable to perform under, such Contracts, or grant any other party thereto the right to modify or terminate such Contract or the performance of any Company thereunder. Each Seller and each Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent from all relevant Persons to allow the Purchaser and its representatives to review all Contracts with respect to which the consummation of the Transactions or the compliance with this Agreement, could reasonably be expected to result in, or cause a default, or constitute an event of default (or an event which the giving of notice or the passage of time could cause a default or event of default), or otherwise cause such Company to be in breach of, or unable to perform under, such Contracts, or grant any other party thereto the right to modify or terminate such Contract, or alter the conduct of business thereunder by the parties prior to the date of this Agreement. Each Seller and Company shall cooperate with the Purchaser, and vice versa, in the execution and filing of all notices, forms and agreements as may be 

   ##### 

  

 

necessary to obtain any consent or approvals of any Governmental Authority
that may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the Transactions,
including any consents or approvals relating to any permits, licenses or
registrations held by the Companies or required for the operation of the
Properties. Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Sellers to obtain any such consents to the extent reasonably requested
by Sellers or Companies. 

   

 Section 4.6 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, under applicable laws and regulations to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate and make effective the transactions. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Public Announcements_. Prior to Closing, Sellers and Purchaser will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any written statements with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, and neither Sellers, the Companies nor Purchaser shall issue any such press release or make any such written public statement without the prior consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser may make any public disclosure required by applicable law or stock exchange rule (in which case Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to advise Sellers and give Sellers an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure prior to making the disclosure). 

  

 Section 4.8 _Resignations; Releases_. Each of the Persons identified as officers of the Companies on _Schedule 4.8_ shall tender to Henry Petroleum prior to the Closing Date written resignations from such positions and their employment with the Companies as of the Closing Date, together with a release of all claims against the Companies and the Purchaser in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. In addition, the Sellers and the Companies shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from the Persons identified as employees of the Companies on _Schedule 4.8_ prior to the Closing Date written resignations of their employment with the Companies as of the Closing Date, together with a release of all claims against the Companies and the Purchaser in a form reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Sellers acknowledge that certain of their Affiliates intend to employ the Persons identified on _Schedule 4.8_ and, in connection with their employment by one or more of such Affiliates, to offer such Persons a bonus arrangement substantially similar to the Cash Bonus described in Section 2.3. In the event that a Person identified on _Schedule 4.8_ refuses to execute and deliver to Henry Petroleum the release contemplated by this Section 4.8, Sellers agree not to offer such bonus arrangement to such Persons. Sellers and the Companies also agree to use reasonable best efforts to obtain (i) from each of the employees who is intended to receive a Cash Bonus, an executed and delivered Employee Letter Agreement prior to the Closing Date and (ii) from each of the independent contractors identified in the Compensation Letter, an executed and delivered release contemplated by Section 2.3 prior to the Closing Date. It is the intention of the parties that the resignation of the employees pursuant to Section 4.8 will not adversely affect such employees with regard to obtaining the benefits of vesting in Plans (including permitted actions under Section 4.1(b)) that would have occurred if such employees had remained employed by the Companies immediately after Closing, and the parties agree to take such actions as are reasonably necessary to cause such vesting to occur. 

  

 Section 4.9 _Name Change_. Purchaser agrees to transfer and assign or permit Henry Petroleum to transfer and assign the Henry Petroleum logo trademark to Sellers at Closing, including all registrations listed on _Schedule 4.9_. Sellers agree to grant a limited license to use the Henry logo and trademark to Purchaser until December 1, 2008; _provided_ , _however_ , that such limited license shall continue beyond December 1, 2008 solely to allow Purchaser to use the Henry logo and trademark on all signs in existence in field operations at the time of Closing until March 31, 2009, by which time Purchaser shall have replaced all signs that use the "Henry" name. Purchaser agrees to transfer all 

   ##### 

  

 

operations and permits in the Companies to Purchasers name no later than
December 1, 2008. Purchaser agrees to change the legal name of Henry
Petroleum LP by December 31, 2008 to another name not including the name
"Henry" and to coordinate that name change with Sellers so that they may file
a Certificate of Formation for an entity using that name. By March 31, 2009,
Purchaser will stop all use of the "Henry" name in any public form or fashion
other than in the context of reporting Purchasers historical results of
operations or otherwise describing this Transaction. All other Companies
names will be changed to entity names that do not include the "Henry" name
no later than March 31, 2009. 

   

 Section 4.10 _Employment Matters_. Purchaser agrees that, for a period of two years following the Closing Date, it or one of its Affiliates (including the Companies) will offer to continue the employment of each Retained Employee in the same city of their employment as of immediately prior to the date of this Agreement at a position performing generally similar work activities and job function. The parties acknowledge that the overall job responsibilities of a Retained Employee may be adjusted from time to time during such two year period based upon the organizational and operating structure of Purchaser and its Affiliates and based upon the overall job performance and capabilities of the Retained Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall have the right during such two-year period to terminate the employment of any Retained Employee. In the event that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates terminates the employment of a Retained Employee during the two-year period following the Closing Date for any reason other than for cause (as such term is defined in the Employee Letter Agreement), Purchaser agrees (i) to pay to such terminated Retained Employee, in a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes and subject to any deferral of the time of payment necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 409(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code), (A) the amount of the base salary or wages, if any, that would have otherwise been owed to such Retained Employee from the date of termination of employment until the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) any portion of the Cash Bonus that has not yet been paid and (ii) to provide, from the date of termination until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, such terminated Retained Employee with medical benefits consistent with those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates who have not terminated employment. In the event that the employment of a Retained Employee is terminated due to death or disability (as such term is defined in the Employee Letter Agreement), Purchaser agrees to pay to such Retained Employee, in a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes and subject to any deferral of the time of payment necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 409(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) any portion of the Cash Bonus that has not yet been paid. Each Retained Employee shall be provided with substantially similar benefits afforded to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the base salary or base wage, as applicable, of a Retained Employee be less than the base salary or base wage, as applicable, of such Retained Employee in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, except to the extent of any salary reduction generally applicable to all employees of Purchaser. Accrued and unused vacation and sick leave of each Retained Employee shall be honored by Purchaser and all seniority and vesting earned by such Retained Employee prior to the Closing Date and recognized by the Companies shall be credited by Purchaser to the extent applicable under Purchasers employee benefit plans for eligibility and vesting purposes and for benefit determination purposes under any applicable vacation, sick leave, or severance benefit program, and Purchaser shall approve any amendments necessary of Purchasers employee benefit plans to give effect to the foregoing. 

  

 Section 4.11 _Parachute Payments_. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that a portion of the payments and benefits to be provided to certain employees and directors of the Companies in connection with the Transactions may constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code unless shareholder approval of such payments is obtained in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, subject to the prior review and approval of Purchaser, Sellers shall cause the Companies to seek such shareholder approval in such manner and the Companies may take any and all actions reasonably necessary to secure 

   ##### 

  

 

such approval. At least five days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
provide to Purchaser an original, fully executed copy of all shareholder
consents obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.11. 

   

 Section 4.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_. Each Seller expressly covenants and agrees that: 

   

 (a) for a period of two years from and after the Closing Date, each Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, own, or participate in any of the Properties, but this restriction does not prohibit a Seller from acquiring oil, gas and/or mineral leases, oil and gas leases, contracts, agreements and/or other interests to explore for and/or develop Hydrocarbons in lands where Purchaser has allowed Leases covering those lands or interests in lands or Properties to expire according to their terms for any reason; and 

   

 (b) for a period of two years from and after the date of this Agreement, each Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact with a view to the engagement or employment of any Retained Employee, but this restriction specifically does not include (i) a prohibition on a Seller hiring a Retained Employee who independently responds to a general advertisement for employment without the Seller having directly or indirectly solicited this response, (ii) a prohibition on a Seller directly soliciting or hiring the Retained Employee who has a brother who is expected to be employed by Seller or one of its Affiliates immediately after the Closing, or (iii) a prohibition on a Seller from soliciting or hiring a Retained Employee who at the time he is solicited and hired by Seller is employed by a Person other than Purchaser or its Affiliates. 

   

 (c) Other than the specific restrictions contained in clauses (a) and (b) above, each Seller shall have no other express or implied limitations as to competition with the Purchaser from and after the date of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event any Seller breaches Section 4.12(a) of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right, which right shall be exercisable for a period of 30 months from and after the Closing Date, to cause Seller or its Affiliate to sell, transfer and assign to Purchaser the interest in the Property that was acquired by Seller or its Affiliate in violation of Section 4.12(a) at a price equal to (i) the price paid by such Seller or its Affiliate for such interest in the Property, (ii) plus, any capital expenditures made by such Seller or its Affiliate with respect to such interest in such Property, and (iii) minus, any revenues (net of normal operating expenses) received by such Seller or its Affiliate from such interest in such Property. 

  

 Section 4.13 _Tax Matters_. 

   

 (a) Other than the 2008 Short Period Consolidated Tax Returns, Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared any and all Tax Returns for a member or members of the Company Group covering a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. Not later than 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions) or proposed date of filing (if earlier) of each such Tax Return, Sellers shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Purchaser for its review and comment. Sellers shall make any changes to each such Tax Return reasonably requested by Purchaser, with any disputes resolved by a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized, independent accounting firm, and shall deliver a final draft of such Tax Return to Purchaser prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. To the extent any member of the Company Group is required to execute and/or file any such Tax Return after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause such Tax Return (reflecting all agreed or finally determined changes) to be filed upon receipt thereof. All such Tax Returns shall 

   ##### 

  

   

be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable law. 

   

 (b) Purchaser shall prepare the 2008 Short Period Consolidated Tax Returns and any Tax Returns due for or with respect to a member or members of the Company Group for a Tax period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date. Not later than 30 days prior to the due date (including extensions) or proposed date of filing (if earlier) of each such Tax Return, Purchaser shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Sellers for its review and comment. Purchaser shall make any changes to each such Tax Return reasonably requested by Sellers to the extent such changes would affect the amount of Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 4.13(c), with any disputes resolved by a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized, independent accounting firm, and shall deliver a final draft of such Tax Return to Sellers prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. 

   

 (c) With respect to any Taxes due from Purchaser or its Affiliates (including a member or members of the Company Group after the Closing Date) (i) for a Tax period ending on or before December 31, 2007 (including for this purpose any such period for which the income, receipts or other base of Tax is measured even if the right to do business for a different period is secured by reason of such payment of Taxes), or (ii) as a result of (A) the transactions contemplated by Section 2.8 (to the extent the amount of such Taxes exceeds 36% of the value of the properties and assets set forth on Schedule 2.8(a)), (B) the transactions contemplated by Section 2.9, (C) any breach of the representations or obligations set forth in Section 3.1(m), (D) any breach of the representations or obligations set forth in Section 4.1 (including, solely for this purpose, Taxes resulting from transactions occurring at any time from January 1, 2008 through the Closing Date that would be in breach of such covenant but for the fact they occur prior to the date hereof) or (E) any breach of the representations or obligations set forth in Section 4.11, Sellers shall pay the amount of such Taxes (as set forth on the applicable agreed or finally determined Tax Returns relating thereto or as otherwise agreed by the parties or finally determined by a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized, independent accounting firm) to Purchaser on or before 10 days prior to the due date therefor, and shall otherwise agree promptly to reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for their costs to the extent they are later obligated to pay such Taxes. 

   

 (d) In the event the 2008 Short Period Consolidated Tax Return reflects a net operating loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the parties acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to prepare and cause to be filed an amended return for the Holding Consolidated Group for a prior year or years claiming a refund of Taxes resulting from the carryback of such net operating loss and, as between Purchaser and Sellers, Purchaser shall be entitled to receive and retain any refund or other Tax benefit obtained as a result of such carryback notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments pursuant to any audit of the Tax Returns for such prior years. Purchaser shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to (in each case without the prior consent of Sellers and except as required by applicable Law) amend any Tax Return, or waive or extend any statute of limitations for a Tax period ending on or before or including the Closing Date, if such amendment, waiver, or extension would increase the amount of Taxes payable by any Seller or any member or members of the Company Group for which Sellers are obligated to reimburse Purchaser hereunder. 

   

 (e) Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include the 

   ##### 

  

   

retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , the party requesting assistance shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the party providing such
assistance; _provided_ , _further_ , no party shall be required to
provide assistance at times or in amounts that would interfere unreasonably
with the business and operations of such party. Sellers and Purchaser further
agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed on any member of the Company Group (including with respect
to the Transactions). Sellers and Purchaser further agree, upon request, to
provide the other party with all information regarding the members of the
Company Group that either party is required to report to any Governmental
Authority. 

   

 (f) With respect to any Company Group member that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Sellers and Purchaser agree, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to treat Purchasers purchase of the Shares of such entity in a manner consistent with the holding in Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432. Specifically, such acquisition will be treated (1) by Seller as if it had sold its Shares in such entity to Purchaser and (2) by Purchaser as if it had purchased the assets of such entity. 

   

 (g) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare a schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price and other consideration paid for the Shares, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and taking into account such further adjustments as required for applicable Tax purposes, among the Shares and further among the assets of any member of the Company Group treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with Section 751 and the requirements of Treasury Regulation § 1.1060-1, as applicable. If the parties are able to agree on such allocation within such time period, the parties shall report and file all Tax Returns consistent with the Allocation Schedule and shall take no Tax position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by any Governmental Authority). 

   

 (h) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall determine the amount of any additional Taxes due from Sellers in the event of an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to Purchasers acquisition of Aguasal and shall notify Purchaser of such amount. Within 30 days thereafter, Purchaser shall notify Sellers whether it desires for an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code to be made with respect to its acquisition of Aguasal, and if so, shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the amount of such additional Taxes as determined pursuant to the preceding sentence. Failing such notification by the 120th day after the Closing Date, no such election shall be made with respect to such acquisition and Purchaser shall destroy the Section 338(h)(10) Election Forms received from Sellers at Closing. 

   

 (i) The parties agree that the Purchase Price is inclusive of all applicable sales or use Taxes applicable to the purchase and sale of the Shares, and any other transfer gross receipts, registration, and similar Taxes (including real estate transfer Taxes) (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), if any, that are payable by any party hereto or any member of the Company Group arising out of or in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser. 

    ##### 

 

   

 Section 4.14 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

   

 (a) At any time subsequent to the date of, and prior to termination of this Agreement under _Article VI_, the Sellers and Companies shall not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, agent or employee of, or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by, the Sellers, Companies or any of their respective Affiliates (each a "Seller Representative") (i) solicit, initiate, seek or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or take other action to facilitate any inquiries or the submission of any proposal which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal from any Person other than the Purchaser (a "Third Party"), or (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations relating thereto or in furtherance thereof or accept any Acquisition Proposal. Any Seller or Company shall immediately communicate to the Purchaser the material terms of any written proposal (and the identity of the Person making such proposal) which it may receive, and such Seller or Company shall promptly deliver a copy of such proposal to the Purchaser. The Sellers and Companies agree not to release any Third Party from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality agreement to which any Company is a party. 

   

 (b) Upon execution by the Sellers and Companies of this Agreement, each Seller Representative will terminate any solicitations, encouragement, activities, discussions and negotiations with any Person other than the Purchaser conducted heretofore by the Sellers, Companies or any Seller Representative with respect to any Acquisition Proposal until the earlier of Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_. 

  

 Section 4.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Sellers, the Companies and the Purchaser shall each give prompt written notice to the other of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of and shall provide accurate and complete copies of any and all information relating to, any event of which it becomes aware that has caused or that would be likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Closing, and (b) the failure of such, or any officer, director, employee, or agent of such party, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. A notifying party under this Section 4.15 shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure, before the Closing, any occurrence of (a) or (b) in the proceeding sentence. No such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the parties or the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 4.16 _Confidentiality_. Sellers agree that until March 31, 2010, any facts, information, know-how, processes, trade secrets, customer lists or confidential matters that relate in any way to the Properties or the Companies shall be maintained in confidence and shall not be divulged by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates to any party unless and until they shall become public knowledge (other than by disclosure in breach of this Section 4.16) or as required by applicable Laws, including applicable securities laws and regulations; _provided_ , before any Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates discloses any of the foregoing as may be required by applicable Laws, such Person shall give the Purchaser reasonable advance notice to the extent practicable and give Purchaser an opportunity to take such reasonable actions to minimize the required disclosure. In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. For purposes of clarity, Purchaser acknowledges that any environmental reports or analysis conducted by Purchaser on the Properties between the date of this Agreement and the Closing or termination of this Agreement shall constitute "Confidential Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement and Purchaser shall convey any environmental reports to Sellers promptly following termination, and shall convey any other due diligence materials that constitute 

   ##### 

  

    

Confidential Information to the Sellers upon request, in each case in the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VI_. 

  

 Section 4.17 _Releases and Termination_. At the Closing, each of the Sellers and the Companies will execute mutual releases from any and all obligations (including indemnification obligations) and Claims, known and unknown, that have accrued or may accrue and that relate to acts or omissions prior to the Closing Date, including any and all damages, whether such obligations, Claims or damages arise in tort, contract or statute, including obligations, Claims or damages (a) arising under each Companys Organizational Documents and (b) relating to actions or omissions of any Company or any Seller, or any acts or omissions of the managers, directors, shareholders, officers or members (former or present) including those committed while serving in their capacity as managers, shareholders, directors, officers, members, employees or similar capacities of any Company, and including in each case any and all Claims which such Seller does not know or suspect to exist in his, her or its favor as of the date hereof or as of the Closing or any Claims that a Company may have against a Seller. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 4.17 or the release contemplated herein shall limit in any way the right of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Party to enforce this Agreement or seek damages permitted by this Agreement, including the right to indemnification contemplated by _Article VII_ or any right of the Sellers to seek indemnification under _Article VII_. Effective upon the Closing, each Seller waives any preemptive rights that he may have, or ever had, with respect to any interest in the Companies and waives any right such Seller may have under the Companies Organizational Documents or otherwise to acquire any interest in the Companies being transferred pursuant to, or as contemplated by, this Agreement or any transfer that occurred prior to the date hereof. THE RELEASES WILL APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, AND THE SELLERS AND THE COMPANIES WILL AGREE TO WAIVE THE BENEFITS OF ANY LAW (INCLUDING PRINCIPLES OF COMMON LAW) OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY OR OTHER JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR OF ANY JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THAT PROVIDES THAT A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN SUCH PARTYS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY SUCH PARTY MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. 

  

 Section 4.18 _Identity of Purchaser_. Sellers are contracting for the sale of the Shares to Purchaser, a Delaware corporation.

 (b) by Purchaser if there has been a material breach by any Seller or any Company of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement which cannot be, or has not been, cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is given to such Seller, _provided_ that the right to effect such cure shall not extend beyond the Termination Date and _provided_ _further_ that such breach relates to a representation or warranty that survives Closing pursuant to Section 7.1; 

   

 (c) by the Sellers if there has been a material breach by Purchaser of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement which cannot be, or has not been, cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is given to Purchaser, _provided_ that the right to effect such cure shall not extend beyond the Termination Date; 

   

 (d) by Purchaser, if all conditions of Closing set forth in Section 5.2 of this Agreement have not been satisfied or waived by the Termination Date, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (d) if it is in material violation of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or such failure shall be due to the failure of Purchaser to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; 

   

 (e) by the Sellers, if all conditions of Closing set forth in Section 5.3 of this Agreement have not been satisfied or waived by the Termination Date, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Sellers shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (e) if any of them is in material violation of any of its representations, warranties, or covenants contained in this Agreement or such failure shall be due to the failure of any Seller to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing; 

   

 (f) by any party hereto if any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise 

   ##### 

  

    

prohibiting the Transactions and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; or 

   

 (g) by the Purchaser without penalty, damages or liquidated damages as provided for in Section 2.6. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this  _Article VI_, this Agreement shall be void and of no effect except as to Section 4.16, and shall result in no obligation of or liability to any party or their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, agents or stockholders for damages, penalties or liquidated damages;  _provided_ that: (1) if this Agreement is terminated as a result of an intentional breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement, the party who breached the representation, warranty or covenant shall be liable to the other parties for actual damages, including all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, and (2) if on the Closing Date all conditions to Closing set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied and (A) Purchaser fails to complete the Transactions in violation of this Agreement or (B) Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(e) because the conditions set forth in Sections 5.3(a), (c), (d) and (e) have not been satisfied, Purchaser agrees to pay as liquidated damages to Sellers and not as a penalty the amount of $20,000,000.00 as compensation to Sellers for their losses as a result of Purchasers breach of this Agreement, as the amount of damages suffered by Sellers in such circumstance would be impossible to calculate (the "Reverse Break Fee").

   ##### 

  

    

(collectively, a "Purchaser Indemnified Party") from and against any and all
losses, costs, damages, expenses and liabilities of whatever nature or kind
(including attorneys fees, litigation and court costs and costs to mitigate
any damages in accordance with Section 7.2(g)) (collectively, "Losses")
incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party and resulting from, arising out of,
or relating to any of the following described matters (herein collectively
referred to as the "Seller Indemnified Liabilities," and individually as a
"Seller Indemnified Liability"): 

   

 (i) any of the representations or warranties, other than the Terminating Representations, made by any Seller contained in this Agreement not having been true and correct as of the Closing Date (or as of the specified date in the case of representations and warranties being made only as of a certain date); 

   

 (ii) a breach of any covenant or obligation of a Seller in this Agreement; 

   

 (iii) the Henry Holding Distribution and the Henry Energy Distribution (excluding any Taxes that are incurred as a result of such transactions for which Sellers are liable pursuant to Section 4.13) and the ownership or operation of the Excluded Companies or their assets, whether arising before or after the Closing; and 

   

 (iv) any long-term debt (including the current portion thereof) of the Companies in existence as of the Closing. 

   

 The parties hereto acknowledge that no Company will be responsible in any manner for the indemnification obligations of the Sellers hereunder. 

   

 (b) Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and their respective trustees, administrators, heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Party") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party, resulting from, arising out of, or relating to (i) any of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser contained in this Agreement not having been true and correct as of the Closing Date, (ii) a breach of any covenant or obligation of Purchaser in this Agreement or (iii) any liability or obligation arising out of the ownership or operation of the Companies or their assets or the Properties after the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no claim may be made for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i), 7.2(a)(ii), 7.2(b)(i) or 7.2(b)(ii), unless and until the aggregate of all Losses of the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii), on the one hand, or the Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 7.2(b)(i) and 7.2(b)(ii), on the other hand, as the case may be, exceed $3,000,000.00 (the "Indemnification Threshold Amount"), in which event the Purchaser Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall be entitled to seek indemnity for the amount by which such Losses for which indemnification is provided hereunder exceed the Indemnification Threshold Amount, and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 7.2(b)(i) and 7.2(b)(ii), on the one hand, or the Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii), on the other hand, be entitled to indemnification exceed the amount of $20,000,000.00 (the "Maximum Liability"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Losses suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party arising under Section 7.2(a)(i) as a result of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b) or 3.1(f), or any Losses suffered by a Seller Indemnified Party arising under Section 7.2(b)(i) as a result of a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2(a) or 3.2(b), in each case shall not be subject to the limitations imposed by the Indemnification Threshold Amount or the 

   ##### 

  

    

Maximum Liability, but in each case the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the
Seller Indemnified Party shall not recover damages in excess of the sum of
the Purchase Price, (B) any Losses suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
arising under Section 7.2(a)(ii) as a result of a breach of the covenant set
forth in Section 4.4 shall not be subject to the limitations imposed by the
Indemnification Threshold Amount so long as such Claim for indemnification is
made on or before December 31, 2008 and (C) any Losses suffered by
a Purchaser Indemnified Party arising under Section 7.2(a)(ii) as a result of
a breach of the covenants set forth in Section 4.13(c)(ii)(A) shall not be
subject to the limitations imposed by the Indemnification Threshold Amount or
the Maximum Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall the foregoing limitations limit any claims for indemnification
under Section 7.2(a)(i), 7.2(a)(ii), 7.2(b)(i) or 7.2(b)(ii) in the event of
fraud or criminal intent by the indemnifying party, but in no event shall
an indemnified party be entitled to recover damages in excess of the Purchase
Price. In no event shall "Loss" or "Losses" under this _Article VII_ include
lost profits, consequential or special or punitive damages or penalties
unless the indemnified party has become liable for such damages as a result
of a third-party claim, in which case such indemnified party may recover such
damages from the indemnifying party as actual damages. 

   

 (d) The amount of Losses for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification shall be reduced by any insurance recoveries or other indemnities, contributions or similar payments actually recovered from any third party as a result of the incurrence of such Losses or the facts or circumstances giving rise thereto (including with respect to Losses resulting from the split off of Summit Petroleum Management Corporation, f/k/a Team Operating Corporation, any recoveries or reimbursements of Taxes under the agreement governing such split off transaction). 

   

 (e) All claims for indemnification under this _Article VII_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

   

 (i) In the event that any claim or demand for which the Sellers could be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from a Purchaser Indemnified Party by a third party, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Agent of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim or demand) (the "Claim Notice"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure or delay in sending a Claim Notice shall not relieve the Sellers from liability hereunder except to the extent the Sellers are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The Sellers shall have 10 days from their receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the Purchaser Indemnified Party (i) whether or not they dispute their liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (ii) whether or not they desire, at their sole cost and expense, to defend the Purchaser Indemnified Party against such claim or demand. In the event that the Sellers notify the Purchaser Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that they do not dispute their liability to the Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder and that they desire to defend the Purchaser Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, except as hereinafter provided, the Sellers shall have the right to defend the Purchaser Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted by them to a final conclusion in such a manner as to avoid any risk of the Purchaser Indemnified Party becoming subject to liability for any other matter. If a Purchaser Indemnified Party desires to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it may do so at its sole cost and expense. Sellers shall not settle or compromise any third-party claim or 

   ##### 

  

    

demand without the prior written consent of the Purchaser Indemnified Party
if such settlement or compromise would restrict Purchaser or otherwise
adversely affect Purchaser in any way, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If, in the reasonable opinion of the
Purchaser Indemnified Party, any such claim or demand involves an issue or
matter which could have a material adverse effect on the business,
operations, properties, assets or prospects of the Purchaser
Indemnified Party, such claim or demand seeks injunctive or other non-
monetary relief against such Purchaser Indemnified Party or such claim or
demand is reasonably likely to result in Losses for which Sellers may not be
obligated to indemnify under this Agreement (including if the amount of such
Loss is reasonably likely to exceed the Maximum Liability), the Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense or settlement
of any such claim or demand; _however_ , its costs and expenses in so doing
shall not be included as part of the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers hereunder. If the Purchaser Indemnified Party should elect to
exercise such right, the Sellers shall have the right to participate in, but
not control, the defense or settlement of such claim or demand at the sole
cost and expense of the Sellers. If the Sellers elect not to defend the
Purchaser Indemnified Party against such claim or demand, whether by not
giving the Purchaser Indemnified Party timely notice as provided above or
otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand, or, if the same be
contested by the Sellers or by the Purchaser Indemnified Party (but the
Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to contest any such
claim or demand), then that portion thereof as to which such defense is
unsuccessful shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the Sellers
hereunder. If the Purchaser Indemnified Party controls the defense of any
claim or demand, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall not settle or
compromise such third-party claim or demand without the prior written consent
of the Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall not be
required to obtain the consent of the Agent if the Sellers are not obligated
to make any indemnification payments under this _Article VII_ as a result of
such settlement or compromise or such settlement or compromise does not
restrict or otherwise adversely affect any Seller in any way. 

   

 (ii) In the event a Purchaser Indemnified Party should have a claim against the Sellers hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party, the Purchaser Indemnified Party shall promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the Agent. If the Sellers do not notify the Purchaser Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that they dispute such claim, it shall be conclusively deemed a liability of Sellers hereunder. 

   

 (iii) All claims for indemnification by a Seller under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved under the procedures set forth above, substituting in the appropriate place "Seller Indemnified Party" for "Purchaser Indemnified Party" and variations thereof and "Purchaser" for "Sellers" and "any Company" and variations thereof. 

   

 (f) For federal income tax purposes, the parties agree to treat (and shall cause each of their respective affiliates to treat) any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to the consideration payable to the Sellers pursuant to _Article II_ hereof unless a final and nonappealable determination by an appropriate Governmental Authority (which shall include the execution of an IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides otherwise. 

   

 (g) Each party hereto agrees to use, and to cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses incurred or to be incurred by such party or its Affiliates 

   ##### 

  

    

upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Loss. Any costs or expenses incurred as a result of the
