WHEREAS, the boards  of directors of the Company and Parent have adopted and
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and the board of directors of the Company has resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of the  Company approve this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 

 

WHEREAS, for federal  income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of

Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 

 

WHEREAS, as a  condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have simultaneously
herewith entered into Voting Agreements substantially in the form attached

_Voting Agreements_ ") in  connection with the Merger; and

 

 

WHEREAS, the parties  desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in  consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 

 

 

ARTICLE I 
  THE MERGER

 

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law and the Pennsylvania
Entity Transactions Law (collectively, the " _PBCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
the Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its  corporate existence under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Upon consummation of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease.

 


 

 


 

     


 

 

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and
time specified in the Statement of Merger (the " _Statement    of Merger_
") filed with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the
" _Pennsylvania Department_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Statement
of Merger.

 

 

1.3 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")    shall take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, on a date no later than
three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to 
applicable Law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or
waived at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions and the  continued satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions
set forth in Article VII), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as  the " _Closing Date_."

 

 

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Parent in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law.

 

 

1.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute, and is hereby  adopted as, a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, each party hereto
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify  as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

 

1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of
the PBCL. Without limiting the generality  of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become  the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of
the following securities, each share of the  common stock, par value $2.50
per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an  issued and
outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and shall not
be affected by the Merger.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-2-  


 

 

 

1.8 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

 

 

(a) Each share of the common stock, par value  $1.00 per share, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except for any Cancelled Shares,  shall be converted
into the right to receive 1.22 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), without
interest and subject to adjustment in accordance with Section  1.8(c), of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), it being understood that upon the 
Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.7, the Parent Common Stock, including
the shares issued to former holders of Company Common Stock as Merger
Consideration, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock issued  and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are owned directly by Parent or the Company
(in each case, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in trust
accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or  otherwise held in
a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties
and (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in respect of
a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to  exist,
and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 

 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the  outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased or changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in
any such case as a result of a reorganization,  recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be  made
to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ ,  that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit
Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

 

1.9 _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards_.

 

 

(a) Company Restricted Stock Awards. At the Effective Time, each award in
respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or
other lapse restriction granted  under a Company Equity Plan (each, a "
_Company Restricted Stock Award_ " that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, pursuant to its terms as  of the date of this Agreement,
shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive, without interest,
the Merger Consideration (less those shares necessary to satisfy applicable
tax withholding) in respect of each share of Company Common  Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award. Notwithstanding any provision of Article
II to the contrary, in Parent's discretion, the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Section 1.9(a) may be paid through the payroll of  Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-3-  


 

 

 

(b) Corporate Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of
the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions
providing for the treatment of the  Company Restricted Stock Awards
contemplated by this Section 1.9.

 

 

1.10 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, DNB First,
National Association, a national banking association and a direct, wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (" _DNB Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank
Merger_ ") with and into SandT  Bank, a Pennsylvania banking corporation and a
direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_ "). Parent Bank
shall be the surviving entity in the  Bank Merger and, following the Bank
Merger, the separate corporate existence of DNB Bank shall cease. The parties
agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the
Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be implemented  pursuant to an
agreement and plan of merger, in a form to be specified by Parent in
consultation with the Company (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). In order  to
obtain the necessary Regulatory Approvals for the Bank Merger, the parties
hereto shall cause the following to be accomplished as promptly as
practicable: (x) the Company shall cause DNB Bank to approve the Bank Merger
Agreement; the Company,  as the sole shareholder of DNB Bank, shall approve
the Bank Merger Agreement; and the Company shall cause DNB Bank to duly
execute and deliver to Parent the Bank Merger Agreement; and (y) Parent shall
cause Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger  Agreement; Parent, as the sole
shareholder of Parent Bank, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement; and
Parent shall cause Parent Bank to duly execute and deliver to the Company the
Bank Merger Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company  shall cause
DNB Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such certificates or
statements of merger and any other documents and certificates as are necessary
to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_ ") immediately
after the Effective Time.

 

 

 

ARTICLE II 
  DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

 

 

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable  to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the
Closing (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of record of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with this 
Article II, (a) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration, and (b) to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(f) (such shares  of Parent Common Stock and cash described in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto (after giving effect to Section 6.13), the " _Exchange
Fund_ "), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the
Merger Consideration.

 

 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the  Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Holder_ ," and collectively, " _Holders_ ") of certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ")   
and uncertificated shares of Common Company Stock represented by book-entry
form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that have been converted into the right to
receive  the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) shall pass only upon
delivery of  Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) or transfer of such Book-Entry Share(s) to the Exchange Agent
and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as
shall be prescribed by the Exchange  Agent and Parent) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Share(s) in exchange for the  Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of a fractional share and any dividends or distributions to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 


 

 


 

 

 

-4-  


 

 

 

(b) Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent  of its Certificate(s) or
transfer of its Book-Entry Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in 
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s), as applicable. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective
Time, for all purposes,  only the right to receive, without interest, the
applicable Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, together with any cash in lieu
of a fractional share and any dividends or  distributions to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared  with respect to Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Book-Entry Share until the Holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or transfer such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this 
Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of such
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the Holder thereof shall
be  entitled to receive, without interest, the amount of any dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock to which the  shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted into the right to receive
and not paid.

 

 

(d) If the Merger Consideration is to be  delivered in exchange for a
Certificate representing Company Common Stock to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition to such  exchange
that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of  the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered
Holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to
the first anniversary of  the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any portion of the Merger Consideration such amounts
as the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any  provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that the
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes  of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-5-  


 

 

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no  transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares or  Book-Entry Shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of a fractional share and
any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled  pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article
II.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect  to Parent
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of
any  such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each Holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share, an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying
(i) the Parent Share  Value by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to  which such Holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.8. The parties acknowledge that
payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was
not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely  represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

 

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that  remains unclaimed by the Holders
of Company Common Stock as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation. Any former Holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this  Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of  each
former share of Company Common Stock such Holder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time  as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person  previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount  delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 

 

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have  been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such  amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the  Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-6-  

 

(i) Subject to the terms of  this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement,
Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of any Letter of  Transmittal and compliance by
any Holder of Company Common Stock with the procedures and instructions set
forth herein and therein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of the whole number
of shares of the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger  Consideration,
into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and
(iii) the method of payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock.

 

 

 

ARTICLE III 
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

 

Except as (a) disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section
or subsection of the disclosure schedule of  the Company delivered herewith
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ ") ( _provided_ ,  that each exception
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify any
other representation and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such
exception to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent 
on the face of the disclosure (notwithstanding the absence of a specific
cross-reference)) or (b) disclosed in any Company SEC Documents publicly filed
prior to the date hereof (but excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk
factors,"  "forward-looking statements" or "market risk" sections or any
other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent as follows:

 

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized,  validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended (" _BHC Act_ ") that has not elected to be treated as a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is
an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing  (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. The deposit accounts of DNB Bank are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid
when due and  no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. DNB Bank is a member
in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and owns the
requisite amount of stock therein.   The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted. The Company and each of its  Subsidiaries is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or  qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. True and complete copies of the Amended and 
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company
Articles of Incorporation_ "), and the Bylaws of the Company, as amended (the
" _Company Bylaws_ "), and the articles or certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, in
each case  as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously

(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure  Schedules sets forth a true
and complete list of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_
")), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock
purchase, restricted stock, cash- or equity-based incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, welfare, retirement, 
severance, change-in-control or other compensatory or benefit plans, programs,
policies or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination,
severance or other Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any of  their respective ERISA Affiliates (as hereinafter defined) is a
party, with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has any current or future obligation,
contingent or otherwise, or that  are maintained, contributed to or sponsored
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates (all such plans, programs,
policies, or Contracts, whether or not listed in Section 3.11(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ ").

 

 

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan,  the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the following
(as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing such Company Benefit Plan
or, with respect to any such plan that is not in writing, a  written
description of the material terms thereof, (ii) the annual report (Form 5500)
filed with the U.S. Department of Labor for the last two (2) plan years, (iii)
the most recently received IRS determination letter, (iv) the most recently 
prepared actuarial report or financial statement, (v) the most recent summary
plan description (or other descriptions of such Company Benefit Plan provided
to employees) and all modifications thereto, (vi) all material correspondence
with a  Governmental Entity, (vii) all amendments, modifications or material
supplements to such Company Benefit Plan, and (viii) any related trust
agreements, insurance Contracts or documents of any other funding
arrangements. Except as specifically  provided in the foregoing documents
delivered or made available to Parent, there are no amendments to any Company
Benefit Plans that have been adopted or approved, nor has the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such  amendments or to adopt or
approve any new Company Benefit Plans.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-17-  

 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been  established, operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take  corrective
action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the
U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has  any Knowledge of any material plan defect that would qualify for
correction under any such program.

 

 

(d) All contributions required to be made to any  Company Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date 
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of the Company.

 

 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is in any  part a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A) complies and, at
all times after December 31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation,
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the final  regulations
and other applicable guidance thereunder and (B) between January 1, 2005 and
December 31, 2008 was operated in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code, as determined under applicable guidance of the U.S. Department of
the  Treasury and the IRS. No compensation payable by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has been reportable as nonqualified deferred compensation
in the gross income of any individual or entity, and subject to an additional
tax, as a result of  the operation of Section 409A of the Code. No assets set
aside for the payment of benefits under any "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" are held outside of the United States, except to the extent
that substantially all of the services to  which such benefits are
attributable have been performed in the jurisdiction in which such assets are
held.

 

 

(f) Section 3.11(f) of the Company Disclosure  Schedules identifies each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the " _Qualified Plans_ "). Unless it is  established pursuant to
an IRS pre-approved prototype or volume submitter plan subject to a favorable
opinion letter on which the Company or its Subsidiaries are entitled to rely,
the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect  to each
Qualified Plan and the related trust has not been revoked, and there are no
existing circumstances, and no events have occurred that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or
the  related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is intended to
meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

 

(g) Section 3.11(g) of the Company Disclosure  Schedules identifies each
Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code (a " _Title IV Plan_ ").   With respect to
each Title IV Plan, (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived, (ii) such Title IV Plan is not in "at risk"
status  within the meaning of Section 430 of the Code or Section 303(i) of
ERISA, (iii) no "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of
ERISA) for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred, (iv) all premiums to  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have
been timely paid in full, (v) no liability (other than for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) has been or is expected to be incurred
by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their  respective ERISA
Affiliates, and (vi) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such Title IV Plan. Since December 31,
2018, there has not been any material change in any actuarial or other 
assumption used to calculate funding obligations with respect to any Title IV
Plan, or any material change in the manner in which contributions to any Title
IV Plan are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-18-  

 

(h) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a  "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at  least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Company and its  Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a
Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of 
Title IV of ERISA.

 

 

(i) There does not now exist, nor do any  circumstances exist that could
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the  foregoing,
none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069, 4204 or
4212 of ERISA.

 

 

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries sponsors, has sponsored
or has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that provides
for any post-employment or post-retirement health or life insurance benefits
or other welfare benefits for former or current  employees or other service
providers, or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all plans  or
arrangements providing for post-employment or post-retirement health or life
insurance benefits or other welfare benefits, and no representations or
commitments, whether or not written, have been made that would limit the
Company's or such  Subsidiary's right to amend, terminate or modify any such
benefits.

 

 

(k) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(k) of  the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, 
exercisability or delivery of, increase in the amount or value of, or trigger
any obligation to fund, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee,
officer, director or other service provider of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or  result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of
assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-19-  

 

(l) Without limiting the generality of Section  3.11(l) and except as set
forth in Section 3.11(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no amount paid
or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the  transactions
contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such
transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit 
Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or
409A of the Code, or otherwise. True, correct and complete copies of Section
280G calculations with respect to any disqualified individual in connection
with the  transactions contemplated hereby are included in Section 3.11(k) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules.

 

 

(m) There are no pending or threatened claims  (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of
circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, 
against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to
their duties to the Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to
result in any  material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple
Employer Plan, any participant in a  Company Benefit Plan, or any other
party. No Company Benefit Plan is under audit or the subject of an
investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, nor  is any
such audit or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened.

 

 

3.12 _Labor Matters_. There are no agreements with, or pending petitions for
recognition of, a labor union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent
for any of the employees of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries and there
are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be brought or
filed with the National Labor Relations Board or any other  comparable
foreign, state or local labor relations tribunal or authority. There are no
organizing activities, labor strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts,
material arbitrations or material grievances or other material labor
disputes,  other than routine grievance matters, now pending or threatened
against or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there have not
been any such labor strikes, work stoppages or other labor troubles with
respect to the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries at any time within five
(5) years of the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or
citation by, any Governmental Entity relating  to employees or employment
practices; and there is no charge of discrimination in employment or
employment practices for any reason, including age, gender, race, religion or
other legally protected category, which has been asserted against the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is now pending before the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity that would
result in liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and
each of its  Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws in
respect of employment, employment practices, including terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, employment discrimination, employee
classification, workers' compensation,  family and medical leave, the
Immigration Reform and Control Act and occupational safety and health
requirements. Each individual who renders services to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such Subsidiary,  as
applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor, consultant or
other non-employee status for any purpose (including for purposes of taxation
and tax reporting and under Company Benefit Plans) is properly so
characterized.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and  each of their employees
hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2016 held, all licenses,
registrations, franchises, certificates, variances, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and 
properties and are and have been in compliance with all, and are not and have
not been in violation of any, applicable Law, except, in each case, where the
failure to hold such license, registration, franchise, certificate, variance,
permit or  authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received
notice of, any violations of any  of the above, except for such violations
that would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a

acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which the Company or any  of its
Subsidiaries serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of
the governing documents and applicable Law. None of the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any
such fiduciary account that would be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole, and the accountings for each such fiduciary
account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect

course of business consistent with prudent business practices to secure
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and except for such

Subsidiaries holds a security interest, is, and has since January 1, 2016,

claims or actions pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there governmental or

expected to result in the imposition, on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental
Law pending or, to the  Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation
that would be or would reasonably be expected to be,  individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

(c) Except as set forth in written third-party  environmental reports

to the period of (i) the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' ownership or
operation of any property, (ii) the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries'
participation in the management of any property or (iii) the Company's or any

radioactive or dangerous materials or other materials regulated under
Environmental Laws in, on,  under or affecting any such property that would
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

 

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are  not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment or decree by or with any court, Governmental Entity
or third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to the
foregoing. There has been no written third-party environmental site 
assessment conducted since January 1, 2016 assessing the presence of hazardous
materials located on any property owned or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is within the possession or control of the Company and its
Affiliates  as of the date of this Agreement that has not been delivered to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

3.19 _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured with
reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as constitute
reasonably adequate coverage against all risks  customarily insured against
by banking institutions and their subsidiaries of comparable size and
operations to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Section 3.19 of the Company
Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and complete list of all  insurance
policies applicable and available to the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
with respect to its business or that are otherwise maintained by or for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Policies_ "), and the
Company has made available true and complete copies of all such Company
Policies to Parent. Except as set forth in Section 3.19 of the Company
Disclosure  Schedules, there is no material claim for coverage by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of such policy as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such

6.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

 

(a) From the Closing Date through the first  anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause to be provided Parent
Employee Compensation and Benefits (as defined below)  for the employees (as
a group) who are actively employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date and continue to be actively employed after the Effective Time ("
_Covered Employees_ ") that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to
the Parent Employee Compensation and Benefits that are generally made
available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries 
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that until such
time as Parent shall cause Covered Employees to participate in the employee 
benefit plans that are made available to similarly situated employees of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), a
Covered Employee's continued participation in the compensation and employee
benefit plans of the  Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to satisfy
the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in any different Parent plans may commence at different times).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the  Continuation Period, each Covered
Employee shall, subject to meeting the applicable eligibility requirements, be
eligible to receive benefits upon qualifying terminations of employment in
accordance with the terms of the severance guidelines or  Contract applicable
to such employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and set forth
on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. " _Parent  Employee
Compensation and Benefits_ " means salary, hourly pay, paid time off, employee
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not subject to
ERISA, and bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,  cash- or
equity-based incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, welfare, retirement, severance, change-in-control or other
compensatory or benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements, and
retention, bonus,  employment, termination, severance or other Contracts to
which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or that are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of any current or former  employee of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-52-  

 

(b) Parent shall assume and honor the  obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other
compensation Contracts in accordance with their terms, except to the extent
such Contract is superseded or modified by an agreement  with Parent or plan
or policy maintained by Parent, _provided_ , that nothing herein shall
prohibit Parent from amending, suspending or terminating any such  Contract
to the extent permitted by its terms and applicable Law.

 

 

(c) To the extent that a Covered Employee  becomes eligible to participate in
Parent Employee Compensation and Benefits, Parent shall cause such Parent
Employee Compensation and Benefits to recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of  eligibility,
participation and vesting under such Parent Employee Compensation and
Benefits, to the same extent that such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Effective Time under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such  Covered Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such recognition of service shall not
(i) operate to  duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to
the same period of service, (ii) apply for any purpose under any incentive
plan, retiree medical plan or defined benefit pension plan or (iii) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or  arrangement that is grandfathered or
frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With
respect to any health care plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered  Employee is
eligible to participate for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (x) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility
waiting  periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with
respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that such limitation would have
been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee participated  immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
recognize any health care expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the
year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to  participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered  to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the board of directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the  Company's 401(k)
plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), effective as of the day prior to the
Closing Date, but subject to the Closing. The form and substance  of such
resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
termination shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent. Following
the Effective Time and (if Parent determines in its sole discretion that a 
determination letter is appropriate) as soon as practicable following receipt
of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and Parent  shall, to the extent permitted by Parent's 401(k)
plan (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Covered Employees who are
actively employed as of the date  immediately following the receipt of such
favorable determination letter (if any) to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code), in the form of cash, in an amount equal  to the full account
balance (excluding loans) distributed to such Covered Employee from the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  shall be in the
form of mutually agreeable communications, prepared in prior consultation with
Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
preparing mutually agreeable communications, including by providing Parent a 
reasonable period of time to review any such communication.

 

 

(f) Without limiting the generality of this  Section 6.5 or Section 9.12, the
provisions of this Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer, director or
independent contractor or any other individual associated  therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no
event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or
modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as  defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of
its  Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the  Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the  Closing Date, the
Company and its Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement
with any employee.

 

 

6.6 _Additional Agreements_.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this  Agreement, each of the
Company and Parent agree to cooperate fully with each other and to use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to  consummate
and make effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or  desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
(including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a
Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full title to all properties,  assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Parent's sole expense,
take all such necessary action as may be  reasonably requested by Parent.

 

 

(b) Parent may at any time change the method of  effecting the Merger and the
Bank Merger (including by providing for the merger of the Company with a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent) if and to the extent requested by Parent,
and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to this  Agreement as
Parent may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with 
respect to the Company's shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to cause
the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the receipt of the
Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the  Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any
time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective
Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, a " _Company
Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses 
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts
that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any actual or threatened
claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding,
whether civil,  criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a " _Claim_
"), in which a Company Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a
party or witness or  arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer,  employee or agent of a corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise if such Claim pertains
to any matter arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including any matter arising, existing or occurring in  connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether
such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Surviving  Corporation shall
pay expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in advance of the final
disposition of any such Claim to each Company Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of an undertaking (in a 
reasonable and customary form) to repay such advance payments if he or she
shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification under
this Section 6.7(a). In the event of any such Claim, the Surviving Corporation
shall  reasonably cooperate with the Company Indemnified Party, and the
Company Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving
Corporation, in the defense of any such Claim.

 

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in  effect for a period of six
(6) years after the Effective Time the currently existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company ( _provided_
,  that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to  claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time and covering persons who are currently covered by
such insurance or who become covered by such insurance prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of
the annual premium payment on the  Company's current policy in effect as of
the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") and, if the Surviving
Corporation is unable to maintain such  policy (or substitute policy) as a
result of this proviso, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time by payment of such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that
(i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation may  substitute therefor a six
(6)-year "tail" prepaid policy the material terms of which, including coverage
and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors
and officers than the Company's existing policies as of the date  hereof;
_provided_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the Maximum Amount for  such
"tail" policy or (ii) Parent may request that the Company obtain such "tail"
prepaid coverage for a six (6)-year period under the Company's existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time).

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall  survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her respective heirs and representatives.
In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors  or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or
assets  to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its successors or assigns, as applicable, shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will expressly  assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.

 

 

6.8 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall list, prior to the Effective Time, on the
NASDAQ, subject to  official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger, and Parent shall give all notices
and make all filings with the NASDAQ required in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein.

 

 

6.9 _No Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) The Company agrees that it shall not, and  shall cause its Subsidiaries
and cause its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
retained representatives (each, a " _Representative_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect  to, or a
transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by
way of tender offer), business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or  similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction
(any of the foregoing inquiries, proposals or offers being referred to herein
as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions with or
provide any nonpublic information or data to any Person (or Representative of
such Person) relating to an  Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction,
or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal or
Alternative Transaction, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement an Acquisition Proposal or  Alternative Transaction, (iii)
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VIII,
approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement,  option
agreement or other Contract (other than a confidentiality agreement entered
into in accordance with this Section 6.9) related to any Acquisition Proposal
or Alternative Transaction (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iv) propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 


 

 


 

 

 

-56-  

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i)
a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than
Parent or its Affiliates, directly or  indirectly, acquires or would acquire
more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or outstanding voting power of the Company, whether from the
Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or  otherwise, (ii) a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business
combination involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries whose   
assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the fair market value of the consolidated assets of  the Company
(except, in each case, the Merger and the Bank Merger), (iii) any transaction
pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or its
Affiliates acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for  this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of any Company Subsidiaries and
securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination
involving any Company Subsidiary) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
representing more  than twenty-five percent (25%) of the fair market value of
all the assets, deposits, net revenues or net income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction or (iv)
any other consolidation, business  combination, recapitalization or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately  prior to such transaction do
not, in the aggregate, own at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the outstanding voting power of
the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately  after the
consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held
the shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation
thereof.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of  directors of the Company
shall be permitted, prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other
terms of this Section 6.9 and to first entering into a confidentiality 
agreement having provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to engage in discussions and
negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or data to, any Person
in response  to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by such
Person first made after the date of this Agreement (that did not result from 
a breach of this Section 6.9) and which the board of directors of the Company
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal,  if and only to the extent that the board of directors of
the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would more likely than not result in a
violation of the directors' fiduciary  duties under applicable Law. The
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information or data
provided to any Person pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or
simultaneously with furnishing such information to such Person.

 

 

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly  (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that informs the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or
negotiations with the Company relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal or
Alternative Transaction.   Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers (including a  copy thereof if in writing and
any related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly,
and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations  concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction or provides nonpublic
information or data to any Person in accordance with Section 6.9(c) and keep
Parent informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries,  discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including by
providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto.

(e) Except as provided in Section 6.9(f), none  of the Company, the board of
directors of the Company, or any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the  Company
Board Recommendation or approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company, the board of directors of the Company or any such
committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby,  (ii) approve or recommend to its shareholders, or
resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or
recommend to its shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) fail to
publicly, finally and without qualification (A)  recommend against any
Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each
case, within ten (10) Business Days after such Acquisition Proposal is made
public or any request by Parent to do so (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in
Company Recommendation_ ").

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement  to the contrary, prior to the
time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, the board of directors of the Company may make a Change
in Company Recommendation if and only if (i) an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.9)
is made to the Company by a third party, and such  Acquisition Proposal is
not withdrawn, (ii) the board of directors of the Company has concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior  Proposal,
(iii) the board of directors of the Company has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would more
likely than not result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties
under  applicable Law, (iv) prior to effecting the Change in Company
Recommendation, three (3) Business Days shall have elapsed since the Company
has given written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action and  specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making,
any such Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a "
_Company Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any
amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new Company Notice of  Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the
three (3) Business Day period referred to in this clause (iv) and in clauses
(v) and (vi) shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days following the giving of
such new Company Notice of  Recommendation Change), (v) during such three (3)
Business Day period, the Company has considered and engaged in good-faith
discussions with Parent regarding any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent and  (vi) the board of directors of the
Company, following such three (3) Business Day period, again reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, and taking into account any  adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that such
Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal
and that failure to make a Change in Company Recommendation would more
likely  than not result in a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ "
means an  unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a third
Person (or group of Persons acting in concert within the meaning of Rule 
13d-5 under the Exchange Act) which the board of directors of the Company has
in good faith determined (taking into account, among other things, (1) its
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and (2)
the terms and  conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (as
it may be proposed to be amended by Parent)), to be more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Company's shareholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be
amended by Parent) and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the
terms proposed, taking into account all other legal, financial, timing,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition  Proposal and the Person
making the proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that for purposes of the
definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to twenty-five percent (25%)
in the definitions of Alternative Transaction and Acquisition Proposal shall
be deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%).

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.9 shall  prohibit the Company or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e‑2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any
other  provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.1(g); _provided_ ,
_further_ ,  that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, which is followed
within ten (10) Business Days by an unqualified public reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation)  shall be deemed to be a Change in Company
Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly
reaffirms without qualification the Company Board Recommendation in connection
with such communication.

 

 

(h) The Company agrees that it (i) will and will  cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or  Alternative
Transaction or similar transaction and (ii) will not release any third party
from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any 
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, and will enforce the terms
thereof and request from such third parties the return or destruction of any
confidential information of the Company provided thereunder. The Company
agrees that it will  promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.9.

 

 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 8.1, nothing  in this Section 6.9 shall
(x) permit either party to terminate this Agreement or (y) affect any other
obligation of the parties under this Agreement. The Company shall not submit
to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or  Alternative
Transaction other than this Agreement and the Merger prior to the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance
known to it that (a) has had or is reasonably  likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, changes, events and circumstances known to it,
to have or to result in any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent,
as applicable, with respect to it or (b) would or would be  reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or that could be expected
to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition  in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a  violation of this Section 6.10 or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise
constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such
notice, in each case unless the underlying breach  would independently result
in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied.

 

 

6.11 _Governance Matters_.

 

 

(a) Effective immediately after the Effective  Time, Parent shall appoint two
(2) current members of the board of directors of the Company as designated by
Parent prior to the Effective Time (each such director, a " _Company   
Director_ ") to the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation for a term
expiring at the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time, and subject to the last sentence
of  this Section 6.11 each Company Director will be nominated for election at
such annual meeting. No other directors or employees of the Company shall be
designated to serve on the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at
the Effective  Time. The appointment of each Company Director to the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be subject to the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and each such Company Director must (i) be designated
by the Nominating and  Corporate Governance Committee of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with such committee's policies and procedures, (ii)
satisfy and comply with the requirements regarding service as a member of the
board of directors of the Surviving  Corporation provided under applicable
Law and the practices and policies of such board that are generally applicable
to its members and (iii) be approved by the board of directors of Parent prior
to the Effective Time.

 

 

(b) Subject to and in accordance with the bylaws  of the Surviving

persons as may thereafter be appointed, shall serve as the officers of the

Southeastern Pennsylvania Market regional advisory board and shall consult
with the Company regarding the composition of such advisory board.

 

 

6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the  reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that  Company Insiders not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion
of shares of Company Common Stock in the Merger, and for that  compensatory
and retention purposes agree to this Section 6.12. The boards of directors of
Parent and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b‑3(d) under the Exchange 
Act), shall reasonably promptly after the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
any derivative  securities with respect to Company Common Stock) by any
Company Insiders and (ii) any acquisitions of Parent Common Stock by any
Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or
directors of the Surviving Corporation  subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable Law.

6.13 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common  Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that holders of Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to  their shares
of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent Common Stock any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 

 

6.14 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party shall take any action that would
cause this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be subject to  requirements imposed by any Takeover
Statute, and each party shall take all necessary steps within its control to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from, or if necessary  challenge the
validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Statute, as now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the 
Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or  minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 

 

6.15 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement and
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in at its own expense the
defense or settlement of any such litigation. In addition, no settlement of
any shareholder litigation against the Company shall be agreed to  without
Parent's prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the Company's  obligations to
the extent required by the terms of any outstanding debt securities, Trust
Preferred Securities or related guarantees. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate to prepare any instrument required by the 
documentation governing such outstanding debt securities, Trust Preferred
Securities or related guarantees pursuant to which Parent shall assume the
obligations of the Company with respect to outstanding debt securities, Trust
Preferred  Securities or related guarantees as of the Closing ("
_Supplemental Instruments_ ") and any related certificates and other documents
required by the  documentation governing such outstanding debt securities,
Trust Preferred Securities or related guarantees. On the Closing Date, the
Company and Parent, as and to the extent required by the documentation
governing such outstanding debt  securities, Trust Preferred Securities or
related guarantees, shall execute and deliver any such Supplemental Instrument
and any related certificates and other documents.

 

 

6.17 _Restructuring Efforts_. If the Company shall have failed to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval at the duly convened Company Shareholders
Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof,  the Company shall (i)
in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of
the transaction provided for herein and/or (ii) resubmit this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to  this
Section 6.17) to its shareholders for adoption and approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that in the case of clause (i) only, the Company shall not have
any obligation to agree to (A) alter or change any material term of this
Agreement, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement or (B)  enter into a restructuring of the transaction
that adversely affects the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to the
shareholders of the Company.

 

 

6.18 _Certain Policies_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted
by Law, the Company shall, consistent with GAAP and on a basis mutually
satisfactory to it and Parent, modify and change its  loan, investments,
liquidity, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on
a basis that is consistent with that of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to take any such action  pursuant to this
Section 6.18 unless and until (i) Parent irrevocably acknowledges to the
Company in writing that all conditions to its obligation to consummate the
Merger have been satisfied, (ii) Parent irrevocably waives in writing any and
all  rights that it may have to terminate this Agreement and (iii) the
Company has obtained the Company Shareholder Approval.

Agreement by the shareholders of the Company:

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Company and  Parent;

 

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if the  Closing shall not have occurred
on or before the End Date; _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be  available to any party
whose action or failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

 

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if any  Regulatory Approval required to
be obtained pursuant to Section 7.1(b) has been denied by the relevant
Governmental Entity and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a  final,

prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

 

(d) by the Company, if Parent has breached or is  in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent
contained in this Agreement in any respect, which breach, if continuing on the
Closing Date, would, individually or together with all such other then-
uncured  breaches by Parent, constitute grounds for the conditions set forth
in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) not to be satisfied on the Closing Date
and such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the End Date and (ii)
the thirtieth (30th)  Business Day after written notice thereof to Parent or
by its nature or timing cannot be cured within such time period;

 

 

(e) by the Company, at any time during  the five-day period commencing with
the Determination Date, if both (i) the number obtained by dividing the
Determination Date Average Closing Price by the Starting Price (the " _Parent
Ratio_ ") shall be less than 0.75, and (ii) (1) the Parent Ratio is less than
(2) the number obtained by dividing the Determination Date Index Price by the
Initial Index Price (the " _Index Ratio_ ") and subtracting 0.25 from the
Index Ratio (such difference, the " _Index Ratio Threshold_ ").

 

 

This Agreement shall terminate on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the

8.1(e) may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Section 8.1(e) Termination 
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that during the five (5) business day  period

Common  Stock shall be entitled to receive in the Merger (calculated based on
the Determination Date Average Closing Price) equals: an amount equal to the
lesser of (1) the product of the Starting Price, 0.75 and the Exchange Ratio
(as in effect  immediately prior to any increase in the Exchange Ratio
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)) or (2) (x) the product of the Index Ratio
Threshold, the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately prior to any increase
in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to  this Section 8.1(e)) and the Determination
Date Average Closing Price, divided by (y) the Parent Ratio. If Parent elects
to increase the Exchange Ratio within such five (5) business day period, it
shall give prompt written notice to the Company  of such election and the
revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 8.1(e) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms; provided, that any references in this Agreement  shall
thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to
this Section 8.1(e).

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company
contained in this Agreement in any respect, which breach, if continuing on the
Closing Date, would, individually or together with all such other  then-
uncured breaches by the Company, constitute grounds for the conditions set
forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) not to be satisfied on the Closing
Date and such breach is not cured prior to the earlier of (i) the End Date and

VOTING AGREEMENT

 

 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "),   dated as of June 5, 2019, is
entered into by and between SandT Bancorp., Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("
_Parent_ "), and the undersigned (the " _Shareholder_ "), a shareholder of DNB
Financial  Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as the same may be amended,  supplemented or modified, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Company,
the Company will be merged with and into  Parent, with Parent as the
surviving corporation (the " _Merger_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder owns beneficially
or of record, and has the power to vote or  direct the voting of, certain
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (" _Common
Stock_ ") (all such shares, the " _Existing Shares_ ");

 

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent has required that the  Shareholder, in his or her capacity
as a shareholder of the Company, enter into this Agreement, and the
Shareholder has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

 

 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good  and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

(b) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be validly terminated
pursuant to the terms thereof, (c) the date of any amendment, restatement,

materially and adversely affects the Shareholder and (d) the mutual written
consent of the parties  hereto. If this Agreement is terminated for any
reason, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no effect; _provided_
that (i) this _Section 2_ and _Sections 10_ through _16_ hereof shall survive

of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth
herein.

_Voting Agreement_. From the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the Closing
and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its  terms
(the " _Support Period_ "), the Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally
hereby agrees that at any meeting (whether annual or special and  each
postponement, recess, adjournment or continuation thereof) of the Company's
shareholders, however called, and in connection with any written consent of
the Company's shareholders, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at such meeting 
or otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares and all other shares of
Common Stock or voting securities over which he or she has acquired beneficial
or record ownership and the power to vote or direct the voting thereof after 
the date hereof (including any shares of Common Stock acquired by means of
purchase, dividend or distribution or pursuant to any other equity awards or
derivative securities (including any Company Restricted Stock Awards) or 
otherwise) (together with the Existing Shares, the " _Shares_ "), which he or
she owns or controls as of the applicable record date, to be counted  as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote or cause
to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) all such
Shares (A) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval 
of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (B) in favor
of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of the Company's
shareholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the
Merger  Agreement and in favor of any advisory, non-binding compensation
proposal set forth in the Proxy Statement and submitted to the shareholders of
the Company in connection with the Merger, (C) against any action or proposal
in favor of  an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, without
regard to the terms of such Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction,
and (D) against any action, proposal, transaction, agreement or amendment of
the Company Articles  of Incorporation or Company Bylaws, in each case, which
would reasonably be likely to (1) result in a material breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company
contained in the  Merger Agreement, or of the Shareholder contained in this
Agreement, or (2) prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Merger. For the  avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments
apply to any Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or other entity
holding Shares for which the Shareholder serves in any partner, shareholder,
trustee or similar capacity. To the  extent the Shareholder does not control,
by himself or herself, the determinations of such shareholder entity, the
Shareholder agrees to exercise all voting or other determination rights he or
she has in such shareholder entity to  carry out the intent and purposes of
his or her support and voting obligations in this paragraph and otherwise set
forth in this Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for
this Agreement, he or she (x) has not  entered into, and shall not enter into
during the Support Period, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect
to the Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not grant during the Support
Period, a proxy, consent or power of  attorney with respect to the Shares
except any proxy to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

agrees that he or she will not, during the Support Period, without the prior
written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell,
transfer, assign, give, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, 
encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary
disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or
involuntarily, enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to
another, in  whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership
of, enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with
respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation
or other  disposition of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by
operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or dispose of, any of the
Shares, or any interest therein, including the right to vote any Shares, as
applicable (a " _Transfer_ "); _provided_ , that the Shareholder may (i) 
Transfer Shares for tax planning, estate planning or philanthropic purposes so
long as the transferee, prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in a signed
writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement, and
the  Shareholder provides at least three (3) Business Days' prior written
notice (which shall include the written consent of the transferee agreeing to
be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Agreement) to Parent, in
which case  the Shareholder shall remain responsible for any breach of this
Agreement by such transferee, or Transfer Shares at such Shareholder's death
pursuant to Law or such Shareholder's estate plan ( _provided_ , that the
transferee agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and comply with the
provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) surrender Shares to the Company in
connection with the  vesting of Company Restricted Stock Awards to satisfy
any withholding for the payment of taxes incurred in connection with such
vesting. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Shareholder hereby authorizes

with respect to all of the Shares.

_Representations  of the Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and
warrants to Parent as follows: (a) the Shareholder has full legal right,
capacity and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform the
Shareholder's obligations  hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes a valid and legally binding
agreement of the  Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in
accordance with its terms (except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by the effect of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium
or other Laws affecting  the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
the effect of general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity), and no
other action is necessary to authorize  the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder or the performance of his or her obligations
hereunder; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the  compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with or violate
any law applicable to the Shareholder or result in any breach of or violation
of, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of  time
or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any of the Shares pursuant to, any agreement or other
instrument or obligation binding upon the Shareholder or the Shares, nor
require any authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any 
Governmental Entity (except for any of the foregoing as would not interfere
with Shareholder's ability to perform Shareholder's obligations hereunder);
(d) the Shareholder beneficially owns and has the power to vote or direct
the  voting of the Shares; (e) the Shareholder beneficially owns the Shares
free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, adverse claim or other Lien
(other than any restrictions created by this Agreement or under applicable
federal  or state securities laws and except for any of the foregoing as
would not interfere with Shareholder's ability to perform Shareholder's
obligations hereunder); and (f) the Shareholder has read and is familiar with
the terms of the  Merger Agreement. The Shareholder agrees that the
Shareholder shall not take any action that would make any representation or
warranty of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the
effect of  preventing, impairing, delaying or adversely affecting the
performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement.
The Shareholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute and deliver
such additional  documents and to take such further actions as are necessary
or reasonably requested by Parent to confirm and assure the rights and
obligations set forth in this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the terms
" _beneficial owner_ ," " _beneficially own_ " and " _beneficial ownership_ "
shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

_Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and, to the extent  referenced herein, the
Merger Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the  parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, other than, if the Shareholder is an officer of the
Company, with respect to any employment agreement between the Shareholder and
the Company, Parent or their respective  affiliates. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person
not a party to this Agreement any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Parent   acknowledges and
agrees that, except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or
incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, 
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain
vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Parent shall have no authority to
manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of
the  policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority
to direct the Shareholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as
otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement is intended to create, and

_Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of  each
party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the  rights under this Agreement

interest of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder.

_Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that  this
Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that Parent would be irreparably harmed if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its 
specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in
such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement,
in  addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled (including
monetary damages), Parent shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions  hereof, and the Shareholder hereby waives any defense in any
action for specific performance or an injunction or other equitable relief
that a remedy at law would be adequate. The Shareholder further agrees that
neither Parent nor any other person or entity shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a 
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the
Shareholder irrevocably waives any right he or she may have to require the
obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the  Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, without regard to any choice- or conflict-of-law provision or
rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction  other than
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    
---|--- 
    

 

In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas of Indiana  County, Pennsylvania or
the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in
the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,  (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not
bring any claim, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the 
transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Court of Common
Pleas of Indiana County, Pennsylvania or the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania.

 

 

Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in any such claim,
action or proceeding shall be effective if  notice is given in accordance
with _Section 11_.

_Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision
of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be  effective and
valid under applicable law. In the event that any provision of this Agreement,
or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder  of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or 
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

_Amendments;  Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in  writing and signed
(a) in the case of an amendment, by Parent and the Shareholder, and (b) in the
case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,  power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

_No Representative Capacity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
this Agreement applies solely to Shareholder in his or her individual capacity
as a  shareholder of the Company, and, to the extent the Shareholder serves
as a member of the board of directors or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary for others, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed  to be an agreement of, or is intended to or shall limit, affect or
restrict any actions taken, or failures to act, by the Shareholder in
Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or  (subject to _Section 3_ ) as a fiduciary for others,
