hundred seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven) (the " _Purchase Price_
"). On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, in accordance with Sections 4.3(g)
- 4.3(i), pay the Purchase Price (i) less an amount of USD 86,304,000 (in
words: US Dollars eighty-six million three hundred four thousand) (the "

subject to and in accordance with Sections 9.7, 10.9 and 10.10, and (ii) less

The Purchase Price was calculated by means of subtracting an amount of USD

Debt_ ") from the enterprise value of the Group Companies in an aggregate
amount of USD 1,006,880,000 (in words: US Dollars one billion six million
eight hundred eighty thousand). The Estimated Net Debt consists of the
Parties joint estimate of the Group Companies (excluding
SANVACs) consolidated Financial Debt (expressed as a positive number) less
Cash as of the Effective Date. The Purchase Price shall be subject to
adjustment in accordance with Sections 3.3 - 3.6. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated to the Shares and the Sold Loans in accordance with _Exhibit 3.1_
(the " _Allocation_ ").

3.2 _Estimated Upstream Loan Amount_. Based on information provided by Seller
prior to the Signing Date, the Parties estimate that the outstanding amounts
and accrued interest under the Upstream Loans as of the Effective Date will be
EUR 2,770,000 (in words: Euro two million seven hundred seventy thousand),
which corresponds to USD 3,984,368 (in words: US Dollars three million nine
hundred eighty-four thousand three hundred sixty-eight) (the " _Estimated
Upstream Loan Amount_ ").

 



\- 12 -  3.3 _Effective Date Report_. Within 60 calendar days following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall prepare a consolidated balance sheet of the Group
Companies (including SANVAC as a cost investment consistent with past
practice) as of the Effective Date (the " _Effective Date Balance Sheet_ ") in
accordance with IFRS as consistently applied in accordance with past practice
for the preparation of the 2010 Financial Statements and for the periods from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010; provided, however, that, in case of
changes to past practice under IFRS during this 3-year period, the most
recent past practice under IFRS shall prevail and that, in case of a deviation
between IFRS and the items to be included in Cash, Financial Debt and Net
Working Capital in accordance with the definitions thereof (e.g., interest
due after the Effective Date), the latter shall prevail (the " _Accounting
Principles_ "), and a statement derived from the Effective Date Balance Sheet
containing the following consolidated positions of the Group Companies as of
the Effective Date: (i) Cash converted into US Dollars at the Exchange Rate
(including a breakdown to each relevant SAP account), (ii) Financial Debt
converted into US Dollars at the Exchange Rate (including a breakdown to each
relevant SAP account), (iii) Financial Debt (expressed as a positive number)
(A) minus Cash, (B) minus the Debt Reduction Amount, if any, and (C) plus the
Debt Increase Amount, if any (the " _Closing Net Debt_ "), (iv) the Net Debt
Upward Adjustment Amount or the Net Debt Downward Adjustment Amount, as the
case may be, (v) Net Working Capital converted into US Dollars at the Exchange

Working Capital Upward Adjustment Amount or the Net Working Capital Downward
Adjustment Amount, as the case may be, and (vii) Purchasers calculation of
the Final Cash Purchase Price (the " _Effective Date Statement_ ", together
with the Effective Date Balance Sheet, the " _Effective Date Report_ ") and
deliver the Effective Date Report to Seller. A sample Effective Date Statement
is attached hereto as _Exhibit 3.3_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Effective Date Balance Sheet and the Effective Date Statement shall disregard
any payments to, or on behalf or for the benefit of, the Group Companies or
creditors of the Group Companies effected on the Closing Date pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any other actions or transactions carried out by or
with Purchaser, its Affiliates (excluding the Group Companies) or the
Financing Parties on the Closing Date in connection with or as a result of
the consummation of the transactions set forth herein (e.g., an assumption of
Purchasers debt by any of the Group Companies or any debt push down).

3.4 _Disputed Items_. Within 30 calendar days from the date on which the
complete Effective Date Report is delivered to Seller, Seller shall review the
Effective Date Report and Purchaser shall make available, and procure that
the Group Companies make available, to Seller and its advisors with reasonable
access to all information and documentation (including a profit and loss
statement) required in order to review the Effective Date Report and to
determine the items set forth in Section 3.3(i) to (vii). If Seller disagrees
in any respect with any item in the Effective Date Statement or Effective Date
Balance Sheet (the " _Disputed Item_ "), it may, within such 30-day period,
deliver a notice setting forth, in reasonable detail, each Disputed Item and
the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith together with, if applicable and
to the extent available, supporting calculations (the " _Dispute Notice_ ");
provided, however, that a dispute notice may only include Disputed Items
relating to Cash, Financial Debt or Net Working Capital. If no Dispute Notice
is received by Purchaser on or prior to the end of such 30-day period, or
if Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that it accepts the Effective Date
Report as prepared by Purchaser, then the Effective Date Report and
Purchasers calculation of the Final Cash Purchase Price therein will become
final and binding for the purposes of Section 3.6.

 



\- 13 -  3.5 _Neutral Auditor_.

 

(a) Within 30 calendar days after Purchasers receipt of a timely Dispute
Notice, unless the matters in the Dispute Notice have otherwise been resolved
by mutual written agreement of the Parties, each of Purchaser and Seller may
request that Deloitte and Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft, or, if
Deloitte and Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft refuses to be

appointed by the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Dusseldorf (
_Institut der Wirtschaftspr ufer in Deutschland e.V._) upon request by either
Party (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ") shall resolve the Disputed Items set forth
in the Dispute Notice. The Neutral Auditor shall conduct a review of the
Effective Date Report, the Dispute Notice, and any supporting documentation
as the Neutral Auditor in accordance with this Agreement and otherwise in its
sole discretion deems necessary, but shall be limited to resolving the
Disputed Items reflected in the Dispute Notice. The Neutral Auditor shall
immediately submit copies of all documents and other information made
available by one Party to the respective other Party. The Neutral Auditor
shall conduct such hearings or hear such presentations by the Parties as the
Neutral Auditor in its sole discretion deems necessary; provided, however,
that the Neutral Auditor shall conduct at least one oral hearing. The Neutral
Auditor shall act as an expert ( _Schiedsgutachter_ ) and not as an

(b) The Neutral Auditor shall, as promptly as practicable and in no event
later than 30 calendar days following its retention by Purchaser and Seller,
deliver to Purchaser and Seller a report in the English language (the "
_Adjustment Report_ "), in which the Neutral Auditor shall resolve all but
only the Disputed Items set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall determine
the Final Cash Purchase Price on that basis. The Adjustment Report shall set
forth, in reasonable detail, the Neutral Auditors determination with respect
to each of the Disputed Items specified in the Dispute Notice and the
revisions, if any, to be made to the Effective Date Balance Sheet, the
Effective Date Statement, the Net Debt Adjustment Amount, the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and the Final Cash Purchase Price. In resolving any
Disputed Item, the Neutral Auditor may not assign a value to such Disputed
Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed by any
Party or less than the smallest value for such Disputed Item claimed by any
Party. The Neutral Auditors fees and expenses shall be borne by the Parties
pro-rata depending to what extent the Neutral Auditor upholds or overrules
their positions, which shall also be determined by the Neutral Auditor in the
Adjustment Report. The Adjustment Report shall be final and binding on the
Parties, subject to Section 319 BGB.

(c) When retaining the Neutral Auditor, the Parties shall instruct the
Neutral Auditor to comply with the provisions of this Section 3.5 and to
determine the relevant amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

3.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. If the Final Cash Purchase Price is higher
than the Cash Purchase Price, Purchaser shall pay the difference to Seller. If
the Final Cash Purchase Price is lower than the Cash Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay the difference to Purchaser. Payment by either Party pursuant to
this Section 3.6 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
free of all charges and unconditionally and shall be due and payable on the
tenth Business Day after the Final Cash Purchase Price has been finally

 



\- 14 -   determined in accordance with Section 3.4, last sentence, Section 3.5(b), or
by mutual written agreement of the Parties to Sellers Account or to
Purchasers Account, as the case may be. Such payment shall bear interest
from and including the Effective Date but excluding the date of payment at a
rate per annum of 0.25%. Such interest will be due and payable simultaneously
with such payment and will be calculated daily on the basis of a 365-day year
and the actual number of days for which that interest is due. The Allocation
shall be adjusted in accordance with the amounts for the Sold Loans set forth
in the Final Effective Date Statement, and the Final Cash Purchase Price
shall be allocated to the Shares and the Sold Loans accordingly.

\- 42 -  ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall Indemnify Purchaser and its
Affiliates or, at Purchasers election, the Group Companies from and against
any Losses (including Losses of the Group Companies), including interest
thereon, caused by, arising out of or relating to (i) any failure by Seller
to fully perform its respective covenants and obligations as set forth herein
or in any instrument or agreement delivered by Seller pursuant hereto (the "
_Seller Covenants)_ ", (ii) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any Seller
Guarantee, (iii) any liability or obligation relating to any of the events or
circumstances described on _Exhibit 9.1_ hereto, and (iv) the Water Supply
Problem to the extent the amount of such Losses exceeds the amount of the
Water Supply Accrual.

9.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Purchaser shall Indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies) from and against any Losses,
including interest thereon, caused by, arising out of or relating to (i) any
failure by Purchaser to fully perform its respective covenants and obligations
as set forth herein or in any instrument or agreement delivered by Purchaser
pursuant hereto, and (ii) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any Purchaser
Guarantee.

9.3 _Indemnification by Guarantor_. Guarantor shall Indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Group Companies) from and against any Losses,
including interest thereon, caused by, arising out of or relating to (i) any
failure by Guarantor to fully perform its respective covenants and obligations
as set forth herein or in any instrument or agreement delivered by Guarantor
pursuant hereto, and (ii) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any of the
Guarantor Guarantees.

9.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.

 

(a) Each Indemnified Party agrees to give the Indemnifying Party prompt (
_unverz uglich_) written notice of any event, or any written claim by a third
Person, of which it obtains knowledge, which will give rise to any Losses
which are required to be indemnified against under this Agreement. Such
written notice, without prejudice to additional claims, shall set forth the
basis on which a claim for indemnity hereunder is requested and, in the case
of claims by a third Person, shall advise the Indemnifying Party whether the
Indemnified Party intends to contest same. The Indemnified Party shall have
the right to contest such claim, in which case the Indemnifying Party, to the
extent legally possible, shall have the right to be represented, at its own
expense, by its own counsel, its participation to be subject to the reasonable
direction of the Indemnified Party.

(b) If the Indemnified Party determines not to contest such claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to contest and
defend against such claim on behalf of and in the name of the Indemnified
Party by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen days
after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice that it intends not to
contest. If the Indemnifying Party determines to contest such claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to be represented, at its own expense,
by its own counsel, its participation to be subject to the reasonable
direction of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party determines to
contest such claim, it shall be deemed to have agreed that such claim is fully
subject to indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party
subsequently determines to settle such claim, such settlement shall be
subject to Section

 



\- 43 -   9.4(d) of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party fails to undertake the
defense of or settle or pay any such third Person claim within 30 days after
the Indemnified Party has given written notice to the Indemnifying Party
advising that the Indemnified Party does not intend to contest such claim, or
if the Indemnifying Party, after having given notice to the Indemnified Party
that it intends to contest such claim, fails promptly or thoroughly to
defend, settle, or pay such claim, then the Indemnified Party may take any and
all action to dispose of such claim, including the settlement or full payment
thereof (in each case without being obligated under the provisions of Section
9.4(d) hereof as a Settling Party) upon such terms as it shall deem
appropriate, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
continue to be obligated in accordance with Section 9.5(a)(vi). When
contesting, settling or otherwise disposing of a claim by a third Person,
Purchaser shall be entitled, and Seller shall be obligated, to take into
account the Group Companies legitimate business interests, including
relationships with customers, suppliers and Governmental Authorities, as well
as savings that could result from adherence to Section 254 paragraphs 1 and 2
BGB.

(c) In any case, each Party shall make available to the other and its
attorneys at all reasonable times during normal business hours, all books,
records, and other documents in its possession relating to such claim and the
Party contesting any such claim shall be furnished all reasonable assistance
in connection therewith by the other Party or Parties.

(d) In the event that a Party (the " _Settling Party_ ") desires to settle any
third Person claim, the Settling Party shall advise the Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in writing of the terms of the
proposed settlement. If such proposed settlement is unsatisfactory to such
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, such Indemnifying
Party or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, to contest such claim by giving written notice
of such election to the Settling Party within 30 days of the Indemnifying
Partys or Indemnified Partys, as the case may be, receipt of the advice of
the proposed settlement. If such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as
the case may be, delivers no such written notice within such 30 days, the
Settling Party may offer the proposed settlement to the third Person making
such claim. If the proposed settlement is not accepted by the third Person
making such claim, any new proposed settlement which the Settling Party may
wish to present to the third Person making such claim shall again be subject
to the provisions of this subparagraph. Any settlement proposed by Sellers
shall contain an unconditional release of Purchaser and its Affiliates from
such claim and shall not involve any non-monetary relief effecting Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates or any of their businesses as then conducted or
proposed to be conducted.

(e) At the time the amount of any liability on the part of an Indemnifying
Party under this Section 9.4 is determined (which in case of payments to a
third Person shall be the earlier of (i) the date of such payment, or (ii) the
date that a court of competent jurisdiction shall enter a judgment, order, or
decree establishing such liability, and in the case of payment of any taxes,
shall be the date such taxes are agreed with or ordered to be paid by the
relevant taxing authority), the Indemnifying Party shall forthwith,
upon notice to the Indemnified Party, pay to the Indemnified Party the amount
of the claim for indemnification.

 



\- 44 -  9.5 _Limitation on Liability_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall
not be liable for, and Purchaser shall not be entitled to bring, any
Purchaser Claim under Section 9.1(ii), or, with respect to Sections
9.5(a)(ii), 9.5(a)(v) to 9.5(a)(vii), under Section 9.1(i), Section 9.1(iii)

the consequences thereof, were (A) known by Purchaser, Guarantor or their
officers, directors, or professional advisors as of the Signing Date, or (B)

respective breach of the relevant Seller Guarantee and the consequences
thereof could have been appreciated and understood by a reasonable business
person ( _Kaufmann_ ) upon due consideration ( _bei verst andiger Wurdigung_)
and without recourse to and independent review of any other source of
information; provided, however, that if and to the extent that a circumstance
has been addressed in this Agreement or any of the exhibits or
schedules, including the Disclosure Schedule, hereto and if and to the extent
that the information contained therein is in contradiction to the information
contained in the Due Diligence Material, the information contained in the Due
Diligence Material shall be ignored and considered not disclosed for purposes
of this Section 9.5; further provided that if and to the extent that a
circumstance has been completely omitted from this Agreement and has not at
all been addressed in any of the exhibits or schedules, including the
Disclosure Schedule, the information contained in the Due Diligence Material
shall be deemed disclosed for purposes of this Section 9.5; and provided
further that any facts or circumstances contained in the 2010 Financial
Statements or the Management Accounts shall only be considered known or fairly
disclosed if and to the extent such facts or circumstances have been taken
into account in the Final Effective Date Balance Sheet.

 

(iv) the Losses result from or are increased by the passing of, or any change
in, after the Closing Date, any law, statute, regulation ( _Verordnung_ ), or
common law rule of any government, governmental department, or regulatory
body; provided, however, that any change regarding enforcement of Laws shall
not be considered a change for purposes of this Section 9.5(a)(iv);

 



\- 45 -  (v) the Losses were caused or increased by Purchasers failure to comply with
the obligations under Section 9.4, provided that Seller proves that such
failure negatively affected its ability to avoid or mitigate its liability;

 

(vi) Purchaser or, after the Closing Date, a Group Company has caused (
_verursacht_ ) or contributed to causing ( _mitverursacht_ ) the Purchaser
Claim (Section 254 paragraph 1 BGB), aggravated or failed to avoid or mitigate
the Purchaser Claim (Section 254 paragraph 2 BGB); provided, however, that
Purchaser shall be entitled to take into account the Group Companies
legitimate business interests, including relationships with customers,
suppliers and Governmental Authorities, as well as savings that could result
from adherence to Section 254 paragraphs 1 and 2 BGB;

 

(vii) Purchaser or a Group Company receives any benefit directly relating to
the respective Loss in the form of "mitigation of damages by benefits
received" ( _Vorteilsausgleich_ ).

(b) In case of a Loss at the level of SANVAC, Sellers liability for such
Loss shall be limited to 49 percent of the Loss incurred by SANVAC.

(c) Sellers aggregate liability under Sections 9.1(ii), 9.1(iii) and 9.1(iv),
and Section 9.1(i) for breach of the Seller Covenants contained in Section
7.1, and Section 10.1 shall be limited to USD 86,304,000 (in words: US
Dollars eighty-six million three hundred four thousand) (the " _General Cap_
"); provided, however, that Sellers aggregate liability for breach of the
Seller Guarantees contained in Sections 5.5(a), 5.6 and 5.8 and the Seller
Covenant contained in Section 7.19 shall be limited to an amount equal to the
final Purchase Price received by Seller; and further provided that Sellers
liability for Tax Indemnification Claims raised after the Release Date shall
be limited to the Tax Escrow Amount. Seller shall not be liable under Section
9.1(ii), unless and until (i) the final amount of an individual claim exceeds
USD 71,920 (in words: US Dollars seventy-one thousand nine hundred and
twenty), it being understood that all claims relating to the same or related
occurrences or events to a series of related occurrences or events shall be
added together for such calculation (all individual claims not exceeding

aggregate amount of all claims (excluding the _De Minimis_ Claims) exceeds USD
2,876,800 (in words: US Dollars two million eight hundred seventy-six

is exceeded, Purchaser shall be entitled to the amount of all Losses (except
for the _De Minimis_ Claims) and not only the amount of the Losses exceeding
the Threshold Amount.

(d) Except for claims for specific performance, the Escrow Amount shall be the
primary source of remedy of Purchaser with regard to any Purchaser Claims,
and Purchaser shall not be entitled to bring any claims against Seller as long

Agreement) against Purchaser Claims.

(e) The provisions of Section 442 BGB shall neither apply directly nor

\- 46 -  9.7 _Release of Escrow Amount_.

 

(a) Two years after the Closing Date (the " _Release Date_ "), Purchaser shall
unconditionally and irrevocably pay the Escrow Amount less the Tax Escrow
Amount to Sellers Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds
free and clear of any bank and other charges except if and to the extent on or
before the Release Date there are (i) " _Resolved Purchaser Claims_ ", which
shall be Purchaser Claims where (A) Seller has acknowledged in writing to be
liable for the underlying Purchaser Claim, (B) Seller and Purchaser have
settled in writing the underlying Purchaser Claim, or (C) Seller has denied

" _Unresolved Purchaser Claims_ ", which shall be Purchaser Claims regarding
which arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.10 have been commenced
prior to the Release Date.

(b) Whenever there is a Resolved Purchaser Claim, the amount for which Seller
acknowledged in writing, agreed in writing or was held to be liable by the

to Section 9.1, except if and to the extent, Seller has (i) remedied the

would have been in if the circumstances giving rise to the Purchaser Claim
would not exist ( _Naturalrestitution_ ), or (ii) paid damages to Purchaser or
any of the Group Companies in relation to such Resolved Purchaser Claim.

 

(c) If and once any Unresolved Purchaser Claim is finally settled after the
Release Date, in whole or in part, by any of the means provided for in

the Escrow Amount retained for such Unresolved Purchaser Claim, except for
portions thereof which may be retained by Purchaser pursuant to Sections 10.9
or 10.10 or may be finally retained by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.7(b),
to Sellers Account by wire transfer of immediately available funds free and
clear of any bank and other charges, except if and to the extent such amounts
are required to cover any other pending Unresolved Purchaser Claims.

 

(d) The Escrow Amount and any portions thereof to be released to Seller shall
bear interest at a rate of 0.25 % per annum since the Closing Date through
the date of payment of the relevant portion of the Escrow Amount. Such
interest shall be due and payable by Purchaser simultaneously with the due
date of the respective portions of the Escrow Amount and will be calculated
on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of calendar days for
which that interest is due.

9.8 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payments made by Purchaser or Seller

TAX INDEMNITY

 

10.1 _Indemnity_. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless ( _freistellen_ )
Purchaser or, at Purchasers sole discretion, the relevant Group Company from
and against all Relevant Taxes owed by the Group Companies (other than the
Morgan Crucible VAT Liabilities) (the " _Tax Indemnification Claim_ "), unless
and to the extent

 

(a) the Relevant Taxes have already been paid to the competent Tax authority
prior to the Closing Date;

 

(b) such Relevant Taxes are the result of any change in law (including
subordinate legislation) coming into force after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that (i) any change regarding the enforcement of laws, and (ii)
changes in law incorporating the interpretation of an existing law by the Tax
courts or as published in administrative guidance shall not be considered a
change for purposes of this Section 10.1(b).

(c) the Relevant Taxes are the result of (i) any change - unless required by
Law - in the accounting and taxation principles or practices of any of the
Group Companies or any successor to all or parts of their business (including
the methods of submitting Tax Returns) introduced after the Closing Date
which have direct retroactive effect for periods ending before the Closing
Date, (ii) a change - unless required by Law - in the exercise of any

 



\- 48 -   Tax election right introduced after the Closing Date, or (iii) the approval
or implementation of any reorganization measure at the level of a Group
Company (including any measures relating to the corporate structure,
financing or refinancing and similar measures) introduced after the Closing
Date;

 

(d) Purchaser or any relevant Group Company or any successor to all or parts
of their business have received in cash any refund (other than a Tax Refund)
relating to any Relevant Taxes from a Person (other than a Group Company,
Purchaser or a Tax authority), including payments (i) by or on behalf of a
party to the Morgan Crucible SPA under or in connection with the Morgan
Crucible Tax Indemnity (other than relating to the Morgan Crucible VAT
Liabilities which shall be exclusively dealt with as set forth in Section
7.9), and (ii) by or on behalf of a party of the Neorem SPA under or in
connection with the share purchase agreement between Vacuumschmelze GmbH and
Co. KG and certain sellers regarding the acquisition of Neorem Magnets Oy and
Neorem Magnets Ningbo Co. Ltd. dated June 1, 2007) (the " _Neorem SPA_
"); provided, however, that if and to the extent that (A) Purchaser is
entitled to a Tax Indemnification Claim, (B) Purchaser has retained the
respective amounts from the Escrow Amount or the Tax Escrow Amount (or
received such amounts in cash from Seller), and (C) a Group Company has an
unpaid indemnification or reimbursement claim against a third Person (other
than another Group Company, Purchaser or Tax authority) with respect to the
Relevant Tax to which the Tax Indemnification Claim relates, Purchaser shall
(i) cause such Group Company to assign its claim for indemnification or
reimbursement to Seller, or (ii) in case of any claims against a party to the
Morgan Crucible SPA or the Neorem SPA under or in connection with the Morgan
Crucible Tax Indemnity (other than relating to the Morgan Crucible VAT
Liabilities which shall be exclusively dealt with in Section 7.9) in
accordance with Section 7.9(a) and under the Neorem SPA - at Sellers option
- cause the Group Companies to enforce such claim subject to Seller
indemnifying ( _freistellen_ ) the Group Companies from any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses associated therewith; for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser shall have no obligation, and shall not be entitled to, enforce or
assign, or to cause any Group Company to enforce or assign, any claims,
including any Tax indemnification or reimbursement claims, relating to the
Equity Participation Program against any beneficiaries thereunder;

(e) The Tax Indemnification Claim results in any benefits to Purchaser, the
Group Companies or Purchasers Affiliates (except for benefits provided for in
Section 10.10), which was subject to the Relevant Tax underlying the
respective Tax Indemnification Claim in the form of a right to set-off or
reduce Taxes in future Tax periods due to the extension of any amortization
or depreciation period, higher depreciation allowances with respect to any
Relevant Taxes, or an increase in the tax contribution amount ( _steuerliches
Einlagekonto_ ) provided that any such benefit occurs within a period of five
(5) years after the Effective Date. The net present value of such benefit
shall be calculated on the basis of the Agreed Tax Rate discounted at a rate
of 10% over a period of five years; 

(f) the Tax Indemnification Claim was caused or increased by Purchasers
failure to comply with the obligations under Section 10.5, provided that
Seller proves that such failure negatively affected its ability to avoid or
mitigate its liability;

(g) the amount of the Relevant Taxes has been taken into account in Financial
Debt included in the Final Effective Date Balance Sheet either as a liability
( _Verbindlichkeit_ ) or as an accrual ( _R uckstellung_), in each case
specifically made for and relating to such Relevant Tax.

 



\- 49 -  10.2 _SANVAC_. If a Tax Indemnification Claim relates to SANVAC, such
Tax Indemnification Claim shall be limited to 49% of the Relevant Tax
relating to such Tax Indemnification Claim, unless any other Group Company is
jointly liable for such Relevant Tax.

 

10.3 _Due Date_. Any payment on the Tax Indemnification Claim shall be due and
payable within ten (10) Business Days after Seller has been notified in
writing by Purchaser about the payment obligation and the corresponding
payment date giving rise to the payment obligation pursuant and in accordance
with this Agreement and has received a copy of the relevant assessment notice
( _Steuerbescheid_ ), but at the latest five (5) Business Days before the Tax
to be indemnified is due and payable to the Tax authority. On request of
Seller, Purchaser shall within a reasonable period provide to Seller any
document, information or data which reasonably may enable Seller to review
the validity of the indemnification request, provided such document is
available to Purchaser and provided further Purchaser is not in breach with
any contractual or legal obligations by providing such document. If a Tax
case is still open but Taxes are due and payable, any indemnification payment
shall be considered as an advanced payment to Purchaser. If subsequently the
Tax for which the advanced payment has been made is reduced again by way of
Tax assessment or otherwise lowered, the difference between the higher
advanced payment and the lower Tax shall be without undue delay reimbursed by
Purchaser to Seller, including all interest related thereto, provided
such reimbursement and interest has been received by the relevant Group
Company in cash.

10.4 _Tax Refunds_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount of any refund of Relevant Taxes
(other than a refund pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or 10.1(e)) including
interest thereon, net of any Taxes on such refund and interest, received by
any of the Group Companies or any successor to all or parts of their business
by cash payment, set-off, deduction or otherwise to the extent such refund
does not lead to any Tax liability or disadvantage, including an increased Tax
liability, after the Closing Date (" _Tax Refund_ "), unless such Tax Refund
has been reflected (i) as part of Cash or Financial Debt in the Final
Effective Date Balance Sheet, or (ii) as part of Net Working Capital in the
Final Effective Date Balance Sheet and was not included in the Net Working
Capital as of May 31, 2011. Any payment under this Section 10.4 shall be due
and payable within ten (10) Business Days after such Tax Refund has been
received by the recipient. If the Tax Refund is realized in several
installments or in more than one taxable period, Purchaser shall refund the
net present value of the Tax Refund which shall be determined in accordance
with the principles set forth in Section 10.1(e). Purchaser shall notify
Seller in writing and without undue delay of any relevant decision by a Tax
authority or expiration of any applicable statute of limitation, as the case
may be, resulting in a Tax Refund.

(b) Purchaser shall pay to Seller any surplus of accruals for Taxes (
_Steuerr uckstellungen_) or liabilities for Taxes ( _sonstige
Verbindlichkeiten aus Steuern_ ) as recorded in the Final Effective Date
Balance Sheet if and to the extent (i) such provisions or liabilities have
been reflected (A) as part of Financial Debt in the Final Effective Date
Balance Sheet, or (B) as part of Net Working Capital in the Final Effective
Date Balance Sheet and were not included in the Net Working Capital as of May
31, 2011, and (ii) the Taxes for which the respective provisions or
liabilities were recorded have been finally and non-appealable assessed at a
lower amount than in the respective liabilities or accruals in the 

 



\- 50 -   Final Effective Date Balance Sheet. Any amount to be paid by Purchaser under
this Section 10.4(b) shall be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days
after the assessments of all Taxes for which the respective provisions or
liabilities were recorded in the Final Effective Date Balance Sheet have
become final and non-appealable.

10.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 10.5(b) through 10.5(d), Purchaser
shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies, fully cooperate with all
reasonable (also taking into account the interests of the Purchaser and the
Group Companies) requests by Seller in connection with any Tax matter
relating to Relevant Taxes, including any inquiry, examination, audit,
investigation, negotiation, dispute, appeal or litigation. Guarantor and
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Group Companies, keep and
make available to Seller all books, records and information that are relevant
(wholly or partly) for Relevant Taxes and to give Seller notice prior to
transferring, discarding or destroying any such books, records or information
and allow Seller to take possession of any such books, records or
information.

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause the Group Companies to prepare
and file, all Tax Returns, which had not to be filed prior to the Closing
Date, regarding Relevant Taxes or which need to be re-filed after the Closing
Date due to the findings of a tax field audit (the " _Relevant Tax Returns_
"). Purchaser shall ensure that (i) any Relevant Tax Returns are filed when
due and in accordance with applicable Laws, (ii) any Relevant Tax Returns are
forwarded at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to filing to Seller for
review and comments, (iii) any Relevant Tax Returns are not filed without the
prior written consent of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
shall be amended in accordance with Sellers reasonable
instructions (including the exercise of tax election rights), provided such
instructions do not negatively affect the future liabilities or Tax position
of Purchaser or any Group Company or the fundamental business or financial
interest of Purchaser or of any Group Company, and (iv) any Relevant Tax
Returns are not amended or changed without the prior written consent of
Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, except (in the cases of
(iii) and (iv) above) to the extent Purchaser can reasonably demonstrate that
a filing or an amendment differing from Sellers instructions is required by
mandatory Law or does not relate to Sellers liability. In the cases of (iii)
and (iv) above, Sellers consent shall be deemed to be granted if Seller
fails to deliver written notice of its consent or instructions within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of forwarding the Relevant Tax Return to Seller.
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser or at Purchasers request the relevant Group
Company from any penalties resulting from any late filing due to Sellers
comments and/or request for amendments to the Relevant Tax Returns.

 

(c) Purchaser shall without undue delay notify Seller of any Tax assessment
notice, any announcement and commencement of any Tax proceedings relating to
any Relevant Taxes. The notification shall be made in writing and without
undue delay after Purchaser and/or the Group Companies became aware of such
event and shall contain reasonable factual information describing the Tax
proceeding. On request of Seller and at Sellers cost, Purchaser shall procure
that Seller obtains any material document or information (including any books
and records) which may be relevant for Seller in this respect.

 



\- 51 -  (d) Purchaser shall, and shall procure that each relevant Group Company does,
(i) ensure that Seller or a counsel of its own choice or its representation is
given the opportunity to be involved (to the extent reasonable) at Sellers
cost in any Tax proceedings which take place after the Closing Date
relating to Relevant Taxes, (ii) provide any information to be furnished to a
Tax auditor in connection with any Tax proceedings relating to Relevant Taxes
to Seller reasonably in advance and give Seller the opportunity to comment on
such information, (iii) upon Sellers request file objections or other
appeals against Tax assessments or challenge and litigate any Tax assessment
or other decision of any Tax authority if and to the extent it is related to
the Relevant Taxes, and (iv) not unreasonably refuse to comply with any
lawful instructions given by Seller in relation to the conduct, including the
settlement, of the Tax proceedings referred in (i) - (iii) above, provided the
action does not affect the future liabilities or Tax position of Purchaser or
any Group Company or the fundamental business or financial interest of
Purchaser or of any Group Company, and further provided that with respect to
(ii) - (iv) Seller indemnifies ( _freistellen_ ) Purchaser and the relevant
Group Companies from any costs, including court fees, expenses for other
proceedings, and fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants and other
experts.

 

10.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Any payments made by Seller under this
ARTICLE X shall constitute an adjustment of the Final Cash Purchase Price for
the Shares.

10.7 _Multiple Claims_. If the facts and circumstances underlying a Tax
Indemnification Claim also result in a claim pursuant to Section 9.1(ii) for
breach of Section 5.25, (i) the provisions and limitations set forth in
ARTICLE IX shall not apply to such Tax Indemnification Claim (except for the
General Cap and Section 9.5(d)), and (ii) the provisions and limitations set
forth in this ARTICLE X shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to such claim pursuant
to Section 9.1(ii) for breach of Section 5.25. To the extent items have been
taken into account as Tax Indemnification Claims they shall not additionally
constitute or trigger any other claim, or be reimbursed, under any other
provision of this Agreement (no double counting).

 

10.8 _Expiration_. Each claim of Purchaser arising under Section 10.1 shall
individually expire ( _verj ahren_) six (6) months after the relevant Tax
assessment, which is no longer subject to a Tax field audit, of Relevant Taxes
resulting in the respective claim has become final and binding ( _rechtskr
aftig_). All claims of Purchaser arising under Section 10.1, which have not
yet expired pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall expire ( _verj ahren_)
six (6) months after the last German Tax assessment, which is no longer
subject to a Tax field audit, in respect of German Relevant Taxes has become
final and binding ( _rechtskr aftig_) (the " _Tax Expiration Date_ "). Section
203 of the German Civil Code (BGB) shall not apply.

 

10.9 _Release of Tax Escrow Amount 1_.

(a) Within ten Business Days after the Tax Expiration Date, Purchaser shall
pay the Tax Escrow Amount 1 to Sellers Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds free and clear of any bank and other charges
except if and to the extent on or before the Tax Expiration Date there are (i)
" _Resolved Tax Claims_ ", which shall be all claims of Purchaser raised
pursuant to Section 10.1 (the " _Tax Claims_ ") where (A) Seller has
acknowledged in writing to be liable, (B) Seller and Purchaser have settled in
writing the Tax Claim, or (C) Seller has denied liability, but where, after
arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.10 have been commenced, the
arbitral tribunal has finally ( _rechtskr aftig_) determined that Seller is
liable for the Tax Claim, or (ii) " _Unresolved Tax Claims_ ", which shall be
Tax Claims regarding which arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.10
have been commenced prior to the Tax Expiration Date.

 



\- 52 -  (b) Whenever there is a Resolved Tax Claim, the amount for which
Seller acknowledged in writing, agreed in writing or was held to be liable by
the arbitration tribunal having jurisdiction pursuant to Section 11.10 may be
finally retained by Purchaser in fulfillment of Sellers obligations pursuant
to Section 10.1.

(c) If and once any Unresolved Tax Claim is finally settled after the Tax
Expiration Date, in whole or in part, by (i) any of the means provided for in
Section 10.9(a)(i), or (ii) Purchaser having waived the Tax Claim, Purchaser
shall pay the portion of the Tax Escrow Amount 1 retained for such Unresolved
Tax Claim, including interest and cost (if any), as provided for in the
settlement or arbitration award pursuant to pursuant to Section 11.10, except
for portions of such Unresolved Tax Claim which may be finally retained by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.9(b), to Sellers Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds free and clear of any bank and other charges,
except if and to the extent such amounts are required to cover any other
pending Unresolved Tax Claims. 

(d) The Tax Escrow Amount 1 and any portions thereof to be released to Seller
shall bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum since the Closing Date
through the date of payment of the relevant portion of the Tax Escrow Amount
1\. Such interest shall be due and payable by Purchaser simultaneously with
the due date of the respective portions of the Tax Escrow Amount 1 and will
be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of calendar
days for which that interest is due.

10.10 _Release of Tax Escrow Amount 2_.

(a) Within ten Business Days after a date (the " _HS Release Date_ ") which
is the later of the Release Date or the HS Expiration Date, Purchaser shall
pay the Tax Escrow Amount 2 to Sellers Account by wire transfer of
immediately available funds free and clear of any bank and other charges
except if and to the extent on or before the HS Release Date there are (i) "
_Resolved HS Claims_ ", which shall be HS Claims where (A) Seller has
acknowledged in writing to be liable, (B) Seller and Purchaser have settled
in writing the HS Claim, or (C) Seller has denied liability, but where, after
arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.10 have been commenced, the

liable for the HS Claim, (ii) " _Unresolved HS Claims_ ", which shall be HS
Claims regarding which arbitration proceedings pursuant to Section 11.10 have
been commenced prior to the HS Release Date, or (iii) Resolved Tax Claims or
Unresolved Tax Claims in excess of the Tax Escrow Amount 1 (provided, however,
that with respect to such excess Tax Claims, Section 10.9 shall apply).

 

(b) Whenever there is a Resolved HS Claim, the amount for which Seller
acknowledged in writing, agreed in writing or was held to be liable by the
arbitration tribunal having jurisdiction pursuant to Section 11.10 may be
finally retained by Purchaser in fulfillment of Sellers obligations pursuant
to Section 10.1.

 

(c) If and once any Unresolved HS Claim is finally settled after the HS
Release Date, in whole or in part, by (i) any of the means provided for in
Section 10.10(a)(i), or (ii) Purchaser having waived the HS Claim, Purchaser
shall pay the portion of the Tax Escrow Amount 2 retained for such Unresolved
HS Claim, including interest and cost (if any), as provided for in the
settlement or arbitration award pursuant to pursuant to Section 11.10, except
for portions of such Unresolved HS Claim which may be finally retained by
Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.10(b), to Sellers Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds free and clear of any bank and other charges,
except if and to the extent such amounts are required to cover any other
pending Unresolved Tax Claims.

 



\- 53 -  (d) The Tax Escrow Amount 2 and any portions thereof to be released to Seller
shall bear interest at a rate of 0.25% per annum since the Closing Date
through the date of payment of the relevant portion of the Tax Escrow Amount
2\. Such interest shall be due and payable by Purchaser simultaneously with
the due date of the respective portions of the Tax Escrow Amount 2 and will
be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of calendar
days for which that interest is due.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 10.9 and 10.10, Purchaser may
retain the Tax Escrow Amount if and to the extent that the amount retained in
accordance with Section 9.7 is in excess of USD 75,084,480 (in words: US
Dollars seventy-five million eighty-four thousand four hundred and eighty).

 

10.11 _US Foreign Tax Credits_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
indemnification payments made by or on behalf of Seller pursuant to this
ARTICLE X arising out of, resulting from or in connection with any Taxes that
are of a nature for which credit is allowed pursuant to Section 901 or 902 of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (and the U.S. Treasury

in connection with any claim or action against a Financing Party relating to

and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which
any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action or
claim in any New York State court or any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and agrees
that any claim, controversy or dispute (whether in tort, contract or

11.5 _Controlling Language_. The English language version of this Agreement
shall be controlling in all respects; provided that where a German term has

Sections are for the express benefit of the Financing Parties.

any rights or obligations hereunder to any Person; provided, however, that
each Party and Guarantor shall be entitled to assign any rights under this
Agreement in part or in full to any of its Affiliates (which in case of
Guarantor shall exclude its direct or indirect shareholders) and, in case of
Seller, to any of its direct or indirect shareholders (but with regard to
JPMorgan Chase and Co only such shareholders who are either direct or indirect
subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase and Co., an investment professional or co-
investor of One Equity Partners or a manager participating in the Equity
Participation Program); and further provided, however, that each of Purchaser

11.8 _No Set-Off; No Right of Retention_. Except as provided otherwise herein,
the Parties and Guarantor shall not be entitled (i) to set off ( _aufrechnen_
) any rights or claims it may have against any rights or claims any other
Party or Guarantor may have under this Agreement, or (ii) to refuse to perform
any obligation it may have under this Agreement on the grounds that it has a
right of retention ( _Zur uckbehaltungsrecht_), unless the rights or claims to
be set-off (including, for payment claims, the amount) or the right of
retention ( _Zur uckbehaltungsrecht_) have been acknowledged ( _anerkannt_ )
in writing by the respective other party or have been established by a final
decision ( _rechtskr aftig festgestellt_) of a competent court ( _Gericht_ )
or competent arbitral tribunal ( _Schiedsgericht_ ).

11.9 _Amendments and Supplements_. This Agreement may be amended or
supplemented or the performance of a provision hereof waived only by an
instrument in writing executed and delivered by a duly authorized director or
officer or attorney-in-fact of each of the Parties hereto, including any
amendment to this provision. If required by applicable Laws, such amendment,
supplement or waiver shall be notarized.

11.10 _Dispute Resolution_. All disputes arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of
Arbitration of the German Institute of Arbitration (the " _DIS Rules_ ") by
three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the DIS Rules in effect at the
time of application without recourse to the ordinary courts of law, it being
understood that a Party or Guarantor may seek injunctive relief in any
competent court of law. The language of the arbitral proceedings shall be
English. The place of arbitration shall be Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

11.11 _Process Agent_. Guarantor hereby irrevocably appoints Purchaser as its
agent for service of process _(Zustellungsbevollm achtiger_) for all legal
proceedings involving Guarantor arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement.

with payments under this Agreement, such Party shall pay default interest
from and including the respective payment date until and including the day
actual payment is made at a rate of ten percent (10%) p.a.

11.13 _Currency Exchange Rate_. For purposes of converting non-USD currencies
into USD under this Agreement, the prevailing exchange rate shall be the
respective 30 day average prior to the Signing Date as published by
oanda.com. For purposes of the Purchase Price Adjustment pursuant to Sections
3.3 - 3.6, the prevailing exchange rate shall be the Exchange Rate.

 



\- 57 -  11.14 _Severability_. Should any provision or portion of this Agreement be
held unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions and
portions of this Agreement shall be unaffected by such holding. Instead of the
unenforceable or invalid provision or portion such provision shall be deemed
agreed which comes as close as possible to the intentions of the Parties and
Guarantor as expressed in this Agreement. The same shall apply if the Parties
inadvertently did not address certain issues in this Agreement which
