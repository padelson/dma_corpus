# **ARTICLE I**

  

# **THE MERGER**

  

## Section 1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as

permitted by applicable Law (as hereinafter defined)) of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and
the ESOP may agree in writing.

  

## Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger in
a form reasonably satisfactory to the ESOP and Tribune Acquisition (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the

Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and
Merger Sub in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

## Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from
and after the Effective Time, all property, rights,

        

## privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.  At and after the
Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Merger Sub.

  

## Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. Subject to Section 5.9, at the Effective Time, (a) the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to
read in its entirety as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub read
immediately prior to the Effective Time, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ , except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
Tribune Company and the provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be omitted, and (b) the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety
as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , with such changes as may
be necessary to comply with any applicable Law or the rules and regulations
of any national securities exchange, in each case, until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law, except the references to Merger Subs
name shall be replaced by references to Tribune Company.

  

## Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors

Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

  

# **ARTICLE II**

  

# **CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

## Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub
or the holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

  

### (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and
each, a " _Share_ "), other than (i) Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined), shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive

        

### Thirty-four Dollars ($34.00) in cash plus the Additional Per
Share Consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The " _Additional Per
Share Consideration_ " shall mean an amount per share, if any, rounded to the
nearest whole cent, equal to (1) Thirty-four Dollars ($34) _multiplied by_
(2) eight percent (8%) _multiplied by_ (3) the Annualized Portion (as
hereinafter defined). The " _Annualized Portion_ " shall mean the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the number of days actually elapsed from and
excluding January 1, 2008 to and including the Closing Date by (y) 365. All
Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

  

### (b) _ESOP and Merger Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by the ESOP or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
(in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties)
(the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement.

  

### (c) _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series E
Preferred Stock of the Company that is owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by an Eagle Entity, which shares constitute all
the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock, shall remain
outstanding following the Merger in accordance with their terms.

  

### (d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. All the shares of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become,
in the aggregate, 56,521,739 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so
converted and, together with the shares of Series E Preferred Stock
referred to above in Section 2.1(c), shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

### (e) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent
required thereby), Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by
holders of such Shares who have not voted in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have properly exercised
appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance with, and who have
complied with, Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders
of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled to receive payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
such Section 262 unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively waives, withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively waives, withdraws or loses such right, such Shares
shall not be deemed Dissenting Shares and will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and have become

        

### exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for payment of the Merger Consideration for such Shares.
At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.2 to
pay for Dissenting Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. The Company will give
the ESOP (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisals of Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company that relate to any
such demand for dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
ESOP, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or
offer to settle any such demands.

  

### (f) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution is declared with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change.

  

## Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company to
act as a paying agent hereunder pursuant to an agreement customary in form
and substance (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders
of the Shares, the Company Stock Options (as hereinafter defined) and the
Company Stock-Based Awards (as hereinafter defined), cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all
of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that

Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II and (ii) the Option and Stock-Based
Consideration (as hereinafter defined) payable pursuant to Section 5.5 (such
cash referred to in subsections (a)(i) and (a)(ii) being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### (b) _Payment Procedures_.

  

#### (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the second business day following the Effective
Time, the Paying Agent shall mail (x) to each holder of record of Shares
whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as the ESOP and the Company

        

#### may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
(y) upon surrender of such documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, to each holder of a Company Stock Option or a Company Stock-
Based Award, a check in an amount, if any, due and payable to such holder
pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option or
Company Stock-Based Award.

  

#### (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in an amount
equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders
properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes (as hereinafter defined) have been paid or
are not applicable.

  

#### (iii) The Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this
Agreement to any holder of Shares or holder of Company Stock Options or
Company Stock-Based Awards, such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") or any
provision of applicable Federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect
to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity (as hereinafter
defined), such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or holder
of the Company Stock Options or Company Stock-Based Awards, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

  

### (c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this Article II.

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that
remains undistributed to the former holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand,
and any former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in
accordance with Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation as general unsecured creditors of the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

        

### 

  

### (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
none of the Company, the ESOP, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

### (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all
cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by the Company;

as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, or commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, a division of The McGraw
Hill Companies, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion

the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the

# **ARTICLE III**

  

# **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (as hereinafter defined)
filed prior to the date hereof, other than risk factor and similar cautionary
disclosure contained in the Company SEC Documents under the headings "Risk
Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" or under any other similar heading,
or as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to the
ESOP immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants to the
ESOP and Merger Sub as follows:

  

## Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._ Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, each
Company Joint Venture is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to own, lease, hold and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing, holding or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to
have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in
this Agreement, " _Company Joint Venture_ " means CareerBuilder,

        

## LLC, ShopLocal, LLC, Topix LLC, Television Food Network, G.P., Comcast
SportsNet Chicago, LLC, Eagle New Media Investments, LLC (" _Eagle New Media_
"), and Eagle Publishing Investments, LLC (" _Eagle Publishing_ " and
together with Eagle New Media, the " _Eagle Entities_ "). As used in
this Agreement, any reference to any facts, circumstances, events or changes
having a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any facts,
circumstances, events or changes that are materially adverse to the business,
assets, financial condition, results of operations on an ongoing basis or
continuing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or that have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company
to perform its obligations under this Agreement, or to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions to be performed or consummated by the Company;
_provided_ ,  _however_ that "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall not
include facts, circumstances, events or changes resulting from (a) changes in
general economic or political conditions or the securities, credit or
financial markets in general, (b) general changes or developments in the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, including
general changes in law or regulation across such industries, (c) the
announcement of this Agreement or the pendency or consummation of the Merger,
(d) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by,
this Agreement or consented to by Tribune Acquisition and the ESOP, (e) any
acts of terrorism or war (other than any of the foregoing that causes any
damage or destruction to or renders unusable any facility or property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (f) the identity of Tribune Acquisition
or the ESOP or any of their affiliates as participants in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other agreements described in the
recitals hereof or (g) changes in GAAP or the interpretation thereof by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Accounting Principles Board, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and other similar
organizations generally considered authoritative with respect to the
interpretation of GAAP, except, in the case of the foregoing clauses (a) and
(b), to the extent such facts, circumstances, events, changes or developments
referred to therein have a disproportionate impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies in the industries
or in the geographic markets in which the Company conducts its businesses
after taking into account the size of the Company relative to such other
companies. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that any decline in
the stock price of the Company Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange or
any failure to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue
or earning predictions for any period shall not, in and of itself, constitute
a Company Material Adverse Effect, but the underlying causes of such decline
or failure shall be considered to the extent applicable (and subject to the
proviso set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) in determining
whether there is a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to the ESOP prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete
copy of the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
by-laws and the charter and comparable organizational documents of each
Company Joint Venture, each as amended through the date hereof. The amended
and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company are in
full force and effect, and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws or
similar organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company and, to
the knowledge of the Company, each Company Joint Venture are in full force
and effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any Company Joint Venture is in material violation of any
provision of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar
organizational documents.

        

## Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

  

### (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 1,400,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 12,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
without par value (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which 6,000,000 shares
are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and 380,972
shares are designated as Series D-1 Preferred Stock (the " _Series
D-1 Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on March 14, 2007, (i)
388,098,408 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding
(including 18,000 Restricted Shares), (ii) 87,035,996 shares of Company
Common Stock were held in treasury, (iii) 60,671,319 shares of Company Common

issued and outstanding and held by the Eagle Entities. All
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, and
all shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance as noted in clause
(iv), when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, are or
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
free of pre-emptive rights and all Liens. ** **As of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, there will be (i) no shares of Series D-1 Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding and (ii) issued and outstanding shares of Series
E **** Preferred Stock, all of which will be held by the Eagle Entities, as
contemplated by that certain Exchange Agreement by and among the Company,

Series E Preferred Stock, when issued in accordance with the terms of the
Exchange Agreement, will be fully authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and free of pre-emptive rights and all Liens.

  

### (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of
March 14, 2007, a complete and correct list of all outstanding Company Stock-
Based Awards, Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options and each right of any
kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or
benefits measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of shares of
Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans, Company Benefit
Plans or otherwise (including restricted stock units, phantom units, deferred
stock units and dividend equivalents), the number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable thereunder or with respect thereto and the exercise price (if
any) and the Company has granted no other such awards since March 14, 2007
and prior to the date hereof. Each grant of a Company Stock Option was
duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company
Stock Option was by its terms to be effective by all necessary corporate
action, including any required shareholder approval by the necessary number
of votes or written consents, and each such grant was made in all material
respects in accordance with the terms of the applicable compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company, the Exchange Act, and all other applicable Laws
and regulatory rules or requirements, including the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange. The per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was
equal to the fair market value (as such term is defined in the applicable
Company Stock Plan) of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable
grant date. The Company has not knowingly granted, and there is no and has
been no Company policy or intentional practice to grant, Company Stock
Options prior to, or otherwise intentionally coordinate the grant of Company
Stock Options with, the release or other public announcement of material
information regarding

        

### the Company or its Subsidiaries or their financial results or prospects.
No outstanding Company Stock Option is intended to qualify as an "incentive
stock option" under Section 422 of the Code.

  

### (c) All outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, were not issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights, purchase option, call or right of first refusal or similar
rights, and are owned by the Company or by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, free and clear of all Liens. To the knowledge of the Company, all of
the outstanding ownership interests in each of the Company Joint Ventures are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and were not
issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights, purchase option,
call or right of first refusal or similar rights.  All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company Joint
Venture that are owned by the Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, are owned free and clear of all Liens.

  

### (d) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, as of the date hereof,
(i) the Company does not have any shares of its capital stock or other voting
securities issued or outstanding other than shares of Company Common Stock
that have become outstanding after March 14, 2007, which were reserved for
issuance as of March 14, 2007 as set forth in subsection (a) above with
respect to awards outstanding as of such date under Company Stock Plans, and
(ii) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible or exchangeable securities, or other similar
rights, undertakings, agreements or commitments of any kind to which the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries is a party obligating the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to (A) issue, transfer or sell,
or cause to be issued, transferred or sold, any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests, (B) issue, grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar right,
undertaking, agreement or arrangement, (C) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any such shares of capital stock or other equity interests, (D)

the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary or
Company Joint Venture or (E) give any person the right to receive any
economic benefit or right similar to or derived from the economic benefits
and rights occurring to holders of Company Common Stock.  Except for the
issuance of shares of Company Common Stock that were reserved for issuance as
set forth in subsection (a) above, and except for regular quarterly cash
dividends, from March 9, 2007 to the date hereof, the Company has not
declared or paid any dividend or distribution in respect of the Company
Common Stock, and has not issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired any Company Common Stock, and its Board of Directors has
not authorized any of the foregoing.

  

### (e) Except for awards to acquire or receive shares of Company Common
Stock under a Company Stock Plan, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or which are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of the Company on any matter.

        

### 

  

### (f) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  

## Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No
Violation_.

  

### (a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval (as hereinafter defined) in the case of the Merger, to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of
Directors of the Company, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, at a duly held meeting has (i) determined that it is fair to and
in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the shareholders of the Company approve the adoption of this
Agreement (the " _Recommendation_ ") and directed that this Agreement and the
Merger be submitted for consideration of the shareholders of the Company at
the Company Meeting (as hereinafter defined). Assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the ESOP and Merger Sub set forth
in Section 4.9, (i) the determinations, approvals and resolutions by
the Board of Directors of the Company are sufficient to render inapplicable
to the ESOP and Merger Sub and this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby the restrictions on "business combinations"
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, no other "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"business combination" or other similar antitakeover statute or regulation
enacted under state or Federal laws in the United States applicable to the
Company is applicable to the ESOP and Merger Sub and this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.  Except for the
Company Shareholder Approval and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
agreement of the ESOP and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms.

  

### (b) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company do not and will
not require any consent, approval, license, authorization, order or permit
of, action by, filing with or notification to any Federal, state, local or
foreign governmental or regulatory agency, commission, court, body, entity or
authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), other than (i) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger, (ii) compliance with the applicable requirements
of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
" _HSR Act_ "), (iii) compliance with the applicable requirements of

"), including the filing of the Proxy Statement (as hereinafter defined) and
the Schedule 13E-3 (as hereinafter defined), (iv) compliance with the
rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, (v) filings with the
Federal Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ "), the FCC Order (as
hereinafter defined), and the state regulatory bodies (the " _State
Commissions_ ") set

        

### forth on Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (vi)
compliance with any applicable foreign or state securities or blue sky laws,
(vii) such of the foregoing as may be required in connection with the
Financing, and (viii) the other consents and/or notices set forth on Section
3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (collectively, clauses (i) through
(viii), the " _Company Approvals_ "), and other than any consent, approval,
authorization, permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to
make or obtain would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, (A) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger. As used herein, " _FCC
Order_ " means one or more orders or decisions of the FCC (or its staff)
which grant all consents or approvals required under the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Communications Act_ ") or the rules, regulations
and published policies of the FCC promulgated thereunder (the " _FCC Rules_
") for the transfer of control or assignment of all FCC licenses, permits or
other authorizations held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
ESOP, Merger Sub or an affiliate of the ESOP or Merger Sub and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or
not any (x) appeal or request for reconsideration or review of such order is
pending, or whether the time for filing any such appeal or request for
reconsideration or review, or any sua sponte action by the FCC with similar
effect, has expired or (y) such order is subject to any condition or
provision of law or regulation of the FCC (whether such law or regulation is
now existing or is proposed in any proceeding pending at the time of receipt
of the FCC Order). There is not pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by or before the FCC any proceeding, notice of violation, order of
forfeiture, complaint or investigation against or relating to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or a Company Station or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any Company Joint Venture, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is
there any fact or circumstance related to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any Company Joint Venture or a Company Station, that
would reasonably be expected to prevent the FCC from issuing the FCC Order.

  

### (c) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the organizational or governing documents of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Company Joint Venture, (ii) assuming compliance
with the matters referenced in Section 3.3(b) and the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, contravene or conflict with or constitute a
violation of any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters referenced in Section
3.3(b), conflict with, contravene, result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation
or to the loss of a material benefit under, or to increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any person (other than
employees of the Company) under, any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or
credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement,
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, right or license to
which the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of their respective properties or assets is bound, or (iv) result in the
creation of any liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security
interests, equities or charges of any kind (each, a " _Lien_ "), other than
any such Lien (A) for Taxes or governmental assessments, charges or claims of
payment not yet due, being contested in good faith or for which adequate
accruals or reserves have been established on the most recent consolidated
balance sheet included in

        

### Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, (B) which is a
carriers, warehousemens, mechanics, materialmens, repairmens or other
similar lien arising in the ordinary course of business, (C) which is
disclosed on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Company or
notes thereto or securing liabilities reflected on such balance sheet or (D)
which was incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the
most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Company (each of the foregoing,
a " _Permitted Lien_ "), upon any of the properties or assets of the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), any such items that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

### (a) The Company has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports
required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since December 25, 2005

amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,

material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the
Subsidiaries of the Company is, or at any time since December 25, 2005 has

### (b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (including all related notes and schedules, where

financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at
the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then
ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein, including
the notes thereto), in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto), and comply as to form with applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.
Since December 25, 2005, there has been no material change in the Companys
accounting methods or principles that would be required to be disclosed in

rule, consensus or pronouncement that, as of the date of this Agreement, has
been adopted by the SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the
Emerging Issues Task Force that is not in effect as of the date of this
Agreement but that, if implemented, could reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule

receives a bona fide written Alternative Proposal that was not solicited
after the execution and delivery hereof (i) which (A) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (B) the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (ii) which the Special Committee or the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Special Committees or the Companys outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company to
take the actions set forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such
Alternative Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable
Law, then the Company may take the following actions:

       

### (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (including its
Representatives) making such Alternative Proposal (if, and only if, prior to
so furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party
an executed agreement having provisions requiring such party to keep
such information confidential that, subject to Section 5.3(d),
are substantially similar to the comparable confidentiality provisions of
that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2006, by
and between the Company and Equity Group Investments, L.L.C. (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), it being understood that such agreement with
such third party need not have comparable standstill provisions), (y) engage
in discussions or negotiations with the third party (including its
Representatives) with respect to the Alternative Proposal, and (z) approve,
recommend and enter into an agreement with the third party with respect to
the Alternative Proposal and exempt such third party from the restrictions
contained in any state takeover or similar laws, including Section 203 of the
DGCL or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply to such Alternative
Proposal, in each case in connection with the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 7.1(g); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) the ESOP shall be entitled to receive an executed copy
of such confidentiality agreement prior to or substantially simultaneously
with the Company furnishing information to the person making such Alternative
Proposal or its Representatives and (2) the Company shall
substantially simultaneously provide or make available to the ESOP any
written material nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Alternative Proposal
or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
the ESOP.

  

### (c) Except as provided in the next sentence, neither the Special
Committee nor the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the
ESOP, the approval or recommendation by the Special Committee or the Board of
Directors of the Company of the Merger or this Agreement or the other
transactions or agreements contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Offer), (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve,
adopt or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iii) recommend that
shareholders of the Company tender their shares in connection with any tender
offer or exchange offer (other than the Offer) or (iv) exempt any person from
the restrictions contained in any state takeover or similar laws, including
Section 203 of the DGCL (each of the foregoing, a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section
5.4(c), the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company may,
at any time, make a Change of Recommendation if the Special Committee or the
Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys or the Special Committees outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure of the Special
Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Change of Recommendation shall change the
approval of the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company
for purposes of (A) causing any state takeover statute or other state law to
be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B)
rendering the Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement inapplicable to
the Merger and the execution and operation of this Agreement.

  

### (d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise
the ESOP orally and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal after the
date hereof or indication

       

### or inquiry after the date hereof with respect to or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request after the
date hereof for nonpublic information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Alternative Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry or request after
the date hereof for discussion or negotiation regarding an Alternative
Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such
Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry and the material terms of any
such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry (including copies of any
document or correspondence evidencing such Alternative Proposal or inquiry).
The Company shall keep the ESOP reasonably informed on a current basis (and
in any event within 48 hours of the occurrence of any material changes or
developments) of the status (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and any material change thereto) of any such Alternative Proposal or
indication or inquiry, including furnishing copies of any written revised
proposals. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 48 hours) notify the ESOP orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal. The Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement
with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing such information to the ESOP as required by this
Section 5.3(d).

  

### (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder, or (ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors
of the Company to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the
Company, the Board of Directors nor the Special Committee may effect a Change
of Recommendation unless permitted by Section 5.3(c).

  

### (f) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
bona fide proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer from or to the
Companys shareholders) made by any person or group of persons prior to the
receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (other than a proposal or offer
by the ESOP, Merger Sub and Tribune Acquisition and other than the Offer) for
(i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar
transaction involving the Company, (ii) the direct or indirect acquisition in
a single transaction or series of related transactions by any person of
assets representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets,
revenues or earnings of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) the direct or
indirect acquisition in a single transaction or series of related
transactions by any person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or (iv) any tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning twenty
percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

  

### (g) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Alternative
Proposal increased to 50%) on terms that the Special Committee or the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good

       

### faith, after consultation with the Companys or the Special
Committees outside legal and financial advisors, and considering such
factors as the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company, as
applicable, consider to be appropriate (including the timing and likelihood
of consummation of such proposal, financial and regulatory aspects, and any
alterations to this Agreement agreed to in writing by the ESOP in response
thereto), is more favorable to the Company and its shareholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## Section 5.4 _Proxy Statement; Company Meeting_.

  

### (a) The Company, the ESOP and Merger Sub shall each use their reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to
be taken under the Exchange Act or any other federal securities Laws, and
under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws, in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3. In connection with the
Merger and the Company Meeting, the Company shall prepare and concurrently
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
Company and the ESOP shall use all reasonable best efforts to respond to the
comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Companys shareholders, all as promptly as reasonably practicable; _provided_
, _however_ , that prior to the concurrent filing of the Proxy Statement and
the Schedule 13E-3 the Company shall consult with the ESOP with respect to
such filings and shall afford the ESOP and its respective Representatives
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. The ESOP and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company with any information for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 which may be required under applicable Law
and/or which is reasonably requested by the Company.  The Company shall
notify the ESOP of the receipt of comments of the SEC and of any request from
the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3 or for additional information, and will promptly supply the ESOP with
copies of all correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Merger. Each of the
Company, the ESOP and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Schedule 13E-3 and any other required filings as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof. Each of the Company, the ESOP and Merger Sub agree to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement or the
Schedule 13E-3 which shall have become false or misleading. If at any time
prior to the Company Meeting any event should occur which is required by
applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Company will promptly inform the
ESOP. In such case, the Company, with the cooperation of the ESOP, will, upon
learning of such event, promptly prepare and file such amendment or
supplement with the SEC to the extent required by applicable Law and shall
mail such amendment or supplement to the Companys shareholders to the extent
required by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to such
filing, the Company shall consult with the ESOP with respect to such
amendment or supplement and shall afford the ESOP and its Representatives
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall have no obligation to notify the ESOP of any matters to the
extent that the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys or the

       

### Special Committees legal counsel, that to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to
the Companys shareholders under applicable Law.

  

### (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall
(i) take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ ")
(including mailing the Proxy Statement as soon as reasonably practicable
after the SEC has cleared the Proxy Statement and holding the Company Meeting
no later than 45 days after mailing the Proxy Statement, unless a later date
is mutually agreed by the Company and the ESOP), and (ii) subject to any
Change of Recommendation of the Board of Directors or the Special Committee
in accordance with Section 5.3(c), (A) include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the
unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, that the shareholders of
the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the written
opinions referred to in Section 3.18 hereof, dated as of the date of this
Agreement (unless the Company shall have been notified of the withdrawal of
either such opinion) and (B) use all reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

### (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII, the Company will take
all of the actions contemplated by Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b)
regardless of whether the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through
the Special Committee, if then in existence) has approved, endorsed or
recommended an Alternative Proposal or has made a Change of Recommendation,
and will submit this Agreement for adoption by the shareholders of the
Company at the Company Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to
hold the Company Meeting if this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article VII.

nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the
Surviving Corporation to establish, maintain or continue any specific plans.
 Furthermore, except as provided in the last sentence of this Section
5.5(b)(i) or in Section 5.5(b)(iv) or (v), no provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to amend, modify or terminate, any plans, programs, policies,
arrangements, agreements or understandings of the Surviving Corporation or
the Company. Without limiting the scope of Section 8.10, nothing herein shall
confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any current or
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any other Person other

Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee
benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements

       

#### of such New Plan shall be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins shall be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,

laws or similar organization documents in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions in any certificate of incorporation,
by-laws or similar organizational documents, for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time, in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or

remain in effect in accordance with its terms); _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action (as hereinafter

continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

  

### (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in

### foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of

costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by

Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby. If such
"tail" prepaid policy or policies has or have been obtained by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause such
policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and

otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation
of

       

### the Merger in accordance with their terms and expressly are intended
to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

  

### (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall

of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  

## Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

  

## Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or

if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an

Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to
the approval of the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or the ESOP in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder.

contrary contained herein, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that
neither the ESOP nor Merger Sub may, without the prior written consent of

substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the

arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.
