 _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES AND BOOK-ENTRY SHARES_

 

Section 3.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company
Stockholder:

(i) any issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $1.00 par value, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") held in the Companys treasury or
held by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(_ _i_ _)_  and
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(ii)_, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.01(b)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal to the
Per-Share

 



3  Amount, _plus_ (ii) one contractual contingent value right per share of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _CVR_ "), subject to and in accordance with
the CVR Agreement (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), in each
case, without any interest thereon and subject to any withholding of Taxes in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_; and

 

(iv) each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one (1) share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation as of immediately after the Closing.

(b) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement through the
Effective Time, any change shall occur in the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock because of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange, readjustment or similar transaction, or if any stock
dividend shall be declared on shares of Company Common Stock and the record
date for such dividend shall fall during such period, then the Merger
Consideration and any other similarly dependent terms shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide the Company Stockholders and holders of Company Options,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company Restricted Shares (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of
Company Convertible Special Stock, the right to convert each share of Company
Convertible Special Stock shall be changed into a right to convert such share
into the kind and amount of Merger Consideration determined in accordance
with the Certificate of Designation.

Section 3.02 _Payment for Shares of Company Common Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, upon the cancellation or
conversion thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and all holders of stock
certificates (" _Stock Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") representing shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
Company Stockholders, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock evidenced thereby as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ (or to appraisal rights as provided in 
_Section_ __ _ 3.03_ with respect to Dissenting Shares), and (b) the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate the Companys
current transfer agent or select a bank or trust company mutually agreeable
to the Company to act as agent (the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of
Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(a)(iii)_. Parent shall enter into agreements reasonably
acceptable to the Company with the Depository Agent and Paying Agent,

 



4  respectively, relating to services to be performed by the Depository Agent
in its capacity as Depository Agent and the Paying Agent in its capacity as
Paying Agent, respectively. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient
to pay the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.01(a)(iii)_ (together with the amount deposited pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to pay the Merger Consideration in the Merger.
If Parent decides to invest the Payment Fund, then the Payment Fund shall be
invested as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) such
investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the
United States and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States,
or in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a
state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (ii)
such investments shall be in in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, and (iii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall become part of the
Payment Fund and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this
_Article III_ shall promptly be paid to Parent upon demand. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the
Paying Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.02(b)_. Nothing in this Agreement and no investment losses resulting from
investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive, or Parents and the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay, such holders applicable portion of
the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in any
event not later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to commence mailing to each Person who
was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock (i) in the case of Stock Certificates, (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery of Stock Certificates shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates shall pass,
upon delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree and shall be prepared prior to Closing) and (B) customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Stock Certificates,
and (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, customary instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Book-Entry Shares, in each case, in exchange for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock evidenced by such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable. Upon (1) in the case of Stock Certificates, delivery to
the Paying Agent of Stock Certificates, together with a validly executed
letter of transmittal, or (2) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, receipt by
the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form and such other
evidence of surrender, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request, the
holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to each share of Company Common Stock evidenced by such Stock
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, and the Stock Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled. The CVRs shall not be
evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of Merger Consideration
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment in the form of or with respect
to the CVRs) may be paid in exchange therefor to a

 



5  Person other than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if (I) such Stock Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or such Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (II) the Person requesting such
payment shall either (x) pay any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of such payment or (y) establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent that such transfer Tax either has
been paid in full or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_, each Stock Certificate and Book-Entry Share
(other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
each share of Company Common Stock evidenced thereby. No interest shall be
paid on the portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any
Stock Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 

(d) If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 3.02(c)_,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such reasonable amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Stock Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay to such
Person the Merger Consideration receivable with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains undistributed to former holders of Stock
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares one (1) year after the Closing Date shall
be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon demand. Any former holders of
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration,
in accordance with this _Article III_ and without any interest thereon,
payable with respect to each share of Company Common Stock previously
evidenced by such Stock Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person
for the portion of any Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date that any unclaimed portion of the Merger
Consideration would otherwise become subject to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to such
Stock Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation. 

(f) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Merger Sub,
and their Affiliates, shall be, subject to Section 5.03(c) of the CVR
Agreement, entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to
deduct and withhold) from (i) the Merger Consideration payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company Options, or (ii) any other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR
Agreement, such amounts as it is required by Law to deduct and withhold with
respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall timely remit to the 

 



6  appropriate Governmental Authority the amount of Taxes withheld. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock, holder of Company Options or other recipient
of consideration hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

Section 3.03 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, (a) all Dissenting Shares shall
be canceled and cease to exist and (b) the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under Section
262 of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such shares of Company Common Stock will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a)
prompt written notice of any written demand for appraisal pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company prior to the Effective Time and (b) the right to
direct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands for appraisal; _provided_ that Parent shall consult with the Company
with respect to such negotiations and proceedings. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall not offer to make, or make any payment, settle or
offer to settle, or, in each case, agree to do any of the foregoing, with
respect to any such demand without Parents prior written consent.

Section 3.04 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (1) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Per-Share Amount over (B) the per-share exercise price for such Company
Option, _multiplied by_ (2) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Company Option and (ii) one (1) CVR for each share of Company
Common Stock underlying such Company Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in each case without interest and subject to any
applicable Tax withholding in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(f)_ (the
" _Company Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ that if the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of any such Company Option is equal to or
greater than the Per-Share Amount, such Company Option shall be canceled
without any cash payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof.
The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay the portion of the Company Option Consideration
(if any) less any required withholding Taxes, payable pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.04(a)(_ _i_ _)_ , through the payroll of the Surviving Corporation
(to the extent such Person is Continuing Company Personnel, and if such

Except (x) as set forth in the Company Reports publicly available and filed
with or furnished to the SEC on or after August 31, 2016 and at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any risk factor
or forward-looking disclosures contained in such documents under the heading

Risk" and any disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements"
disclaimer or other statements that are similarly nonspecific or predictive,

delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), or (z) for any exception or disclosure set forth in
any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent
it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such exception

Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each Company Entity is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing, as applicable, would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each Company Entity has all requisite entity power and authority to enable it
to own, operate, lease or otherwise hold its assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power
or authority would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Entity is
duly qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its businesses or the ownership, operation or leasing of its assets
make such qualification necessary, except in any such jurisdiction where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, of the Company in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and the by-laws of the Company in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. Such certificate of incorporation and
bylaws are in full force and effect.

 



10 Section 4.02 _Company Subsidiaries_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 4.02_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of

Subsidiary owned by the Company and each of its other Company Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,

interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable

venture or other business association or entity. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies in all material respects of the
articles of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent Organizational Documents)
of each material Company Subsidiary in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. Such articles of incorporation, bylaws and equivalent
Organizational Documents are in full force and effect, except as would not
result in or would reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

by reference, but excluding the Proxy Statement, being collectively referred
to as the " _Company Reports_ "). Each Company Report (i) at the time

reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) the Company maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" required by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be

Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents and (ii) the Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to
the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board

29 Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy, in all material respects,

after giving effect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
(including payment of all amounts payable under _Article I_ in connection
with or as a result of the Merger) and the payment of all related fees and
expenses, Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the Company
Entities) shall be Solvent as of the Closing Date immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any
Person, shall mean that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,

liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" mean
that such Person shall be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. Parent is not entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company Entities.

(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in

 



30  equity) against (1) the Company in connection with the accuracy,
completeness or materiality of any Projection and (2) any Affiliate of the
Company or the Companys or any such Affiliates respective Representatives
or equity holders, and hereby specifically acknowledges and agrees that such
Affiliate of the Company or the Companys or any such Affiliates respective
Representatives or equity holders shall have no liability or obligations,
based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement, including (A) for
any alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Person or
(B) in connection with the accuracy, completeness or materiality of any
Projection. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (1) it
has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent investigation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to the
Company Entities and their respective businesses, operations, assets and
liabilities) and, in making its determination to enter into this Agreement and
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has relied
solely on the results of such independent investigation and the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ ,
respectively, and (2) except for the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in _Article IV_ , it has not relied on, or been induced by, any
representation, warranty or other statement of or by the Company or any of its

businesses, assets, employees, Permits, liabilities, operations, prospects or
condition (financial or otherwise) or any Projection, in determining to enter

agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such
agreement, in each case, with respect to the submission of any Company
Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may grant a
waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (I) to
the extent necessary to allow a Company Takeover Proposal to be made to the
Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) and (II) if the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_, _Section_ __ _
6.02(d)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.02(f)_, and except for the public disclosure

allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
agreement or commitment constituting, or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or that would reasonably
be expected to cause, the Company to abandon or terminate this Agreement (a "
_Company Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



37 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained,
in response to the Companys receipt of a Superior Company Proposal, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , in each case,
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor) that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , as applicable, would be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company Board may not make such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or so terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ unless (1) the Company Board has delivered to Parent
prior written notice that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which
Recommendation Change Notice shall, at the Companys option, (A) attach the
most current draft of any proposed Company Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Company Proposal or (B) include a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal, including the amount
and type of consideration offered, the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making the Superior Company Proposal, the proposed

Parent, during the four (4) Business Day period after delivery of the
Recommendation Change Notice, the Company and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (3) no earlier than the
end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor), shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any proposed revision
to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) Business Day period,
that such Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Company Proposal and that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_
_i_ _)_ in connection therewith, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if any revision to
the financial terms or any other material revisions are made to any such
Superior Company Proposal, the Company Board shall deliver a new notice
to Parent as provided above, during which notice period the Company shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.02(c)_
anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two (2) Business Days. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, in
response to a Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) that
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may not make such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change unless (1) the Company Board has delivered to
Parent a Recommendation Change Notice describing in reasonable detail such
Company Intervening Event and the reasons for such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (2) if requested by Parent, during the four (4)
Business Day period after delivery of the Recommendation Change Notice, the
Company and its Representatives negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent,
and (3) no earlier

 



38  than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the Company Board (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor) shall have
determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any revision to this
Agreement proposed by Parent during such four (4) Business Day period, that
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Reasonably promptly (and, in any event, within one Business Day (but in
no event longer than forty-eight (48) hours)) following receipt by any
executive officer of the Company or any executive officer of the Company being
made aware of receipt by any of its Representatives of any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer, including any request for non-
public information, that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Company Takeover Proposal, the Company shall notify Parent orally and in
writing of any such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer,
the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover Proposal,
inquiry, proposal or offer (including drafts and final versions of definitive
agreements, letters of intent, term sheets or commitment letters related
thereto, including schedules and exhibits to such documents) and the identity
of the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
offer. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the material terms and status (including any change to the
material terms thereof) of any such Company Takeover Proposal inquiry,
proposal or offer (and, in any event, within one Business Day (but in no event
longer than forty-eight (48) hours)). The Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours) following a determination by the Company
Board that a Company Takeover Proposal is a Superior Company Proposal, notify
Parent of such determination.

(f) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company
from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders if, in
the good-faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ that any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.02(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, a factually
accurate public statement that describes the Companys receipt of a Company
Takeover Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto
shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

Persons (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) after the date of this
Agreement, which Company Takeover Proposal the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial
advisor, and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal (including the identity of the
Person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the expected timing and
likelihood of consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements,
conditions to consummation and availability of necessary financing) as the
Company Board deems relevant is more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

foreseeable by, the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (or if

Proposal, (3) becomes known to or by the Company Board prior to the Closing,
and (4) is not a result of, or does not relate to, a breach of this Agreement
by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any events, changes or

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to filing the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form with the SEC, responding to any comment
from the SEC with respect to, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to, the Proxy Statement or mailing the Proxy Statement
in definitive form to the Company Stockholders, the Company shall provide
Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
and consider in good faith any of Parents comments thereon. Each Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to have the SEC advise the Company, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing of the preliminary Proxy
Statement, that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, and
each of the Company and Parent shall also take any other action (except for
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger.

(e) If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other

necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, and, as required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to Parents stockholders
and the Company Stockholders. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(e)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_.

(f) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, that
is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading and, as required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to Parents stockholders
and the Company Stockholders. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.03(f)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section_ __ _ 6.03(a)_.

(g) In accordance with the restated certificate of incorporation, as
amended, of the Company and the by-laws of the Company, (i) the Company shall,
as soon as practicable after the mailing of the definitive Proxy Statement to
the Company Stockholders, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and taking action
on this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) solicit from its stockholders
proxies 

 



42  in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Neither the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to
the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior
Company Proposal), nor any furnishing of information, discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto, nor any decision or action by the Company
Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall limit or
otherwise affect the Companys obligation to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and to submit this Agreement for
adoption at the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company agrees that it
shall not submit to a vote of the Company Stockholders any Company Takeover
Proposal or Company Acquisition Agreement (in either case, whether or not a
Superior Company Proposal) prior to the vote of the Company Stockholders
regarding the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent the Company reasonably
determines after consultation with outside counsel that any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is required by Law to be provided to the
Company Stockholders or, if as of the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting more than 30 days after the date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled or to a date on or after three
(3) Business Days prior to the End Date.

 

(h) The Company shall be responsible for 100% of the fees, costs and
expenses, including any filing fees, associated with the preparation, filing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, (i)
provide Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (at Parents sole
cost and expense), during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_, to the Companys offices, properties, books and
records, contracts, and Company designated personnel, in each case for any
reasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and (ii) cooperate with Parent and promptly provide any
reasonable information and any assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with (A) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including with respect to the integration of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries
and (B) the matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such access shall be
conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of
appropriate personnel of the applicable Company Entity and in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company Entities, and (B) the Company may withhold from Parent or its
Representatives any document or information that the Company reasonably
believes (w) is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party or another contract otherwise restricting such access ( _provided_
 that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
required consent of such third party to

 



43  disclose such document or information), (x) is subject to any attorney-
client or other legal privilege ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to allow the disclosure of such document
or information (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result
in a loss of attorney-client privilege), (y) is commercially sensitive (
_provided_ that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access pursuant
to a customary "clean team" arrangement with Parent) or (z) disclosure of such
document or information to Parent or its Representatives would violate any
Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does
not violate Law). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any access or make any
disclosure to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ to the extent such
access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation where the
Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, prior to the
Effective Time, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.04_ for any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of
the Merger.

 

(c) All documents and information exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.04_ __ shall be subject to the letter agreement, dated as of October 27,
2017, between the Company and Lyondell Chemical Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), as if each of Parent and Merger Sub were
subject to the obligations of Lyondell Chemical Company under the
Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub
on behalf of Lyondell Chemical Company, on the other hand, agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically be deemed to be amended and
restated such that (i) paragraph 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in effect for twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,
as if the Parties had never entered into this Agreement, and (ii) the other
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect for two (2)
years after such termination, in each case, as if the Parties had
never entered into this Agreement.

Section 6.05 _Further Actions; Regulatory Approvals; Required Actions_. 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and to cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary to cause the conditions to the Closing
set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to effect the Closing as promptly as reasonably practicable,
including (i) making all necessary Filings with Governmental Authorities or
third parties, (ii) requesting early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act applicable to the Merger and using reasonable best efforts to
obtain the HSR Clearance and all other Consents of Governmental Authorities
that are necessary to consummate the Merger as promptly as reasonably
practicable and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties that are necessary to consummate the
Merger. Parent shall be responsible for 100% of the fees, costs and expenses
(except for the fees, costs and expenses of the Companys advisors),
including any filing fees, associated with any Filings or Consents
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_.

 



44 (b) In connection with and without limiting the generality of  _Section_
__ _ 6.05(a)_, each of Parent and the Company shall:

(i) file or cause to be filed with the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission, in consultation and cooperation with the other, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and, in any event, no
later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, an
appropriate Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act relating to
the Merger;

 

(ii) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the
other, all other necessary, proper or advisable Filings under any Antitrust
Law with respect to the Merger, or, where the Filing is made pursuant to an
Antitrust Law where the Governmental Authority first reviews drafts of the
relevant filing, a draft of the relevant filing, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and, in any event, no later than thirty (30) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, with the exception of either the request for an
advisory opinion or a Filing pursuant to the Antitrust Laws of Argentina,
which request or Filing shall be made no later than the earlier of (x) seven
(7) days following the Closing assuming the such Law is not suspensory or (y)
within thirty (30) days of such law becoming suspensory and applicable to the
Merger;

(iii) make or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all other necessary Filings
with other Governmental Authorities relating to the Merger;

 

(iv) furnish to the other all assistance, cooperation and information
reasonably required for any such Filing and in order to achieve the effects
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_;

 

(v) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by a Governmental Authority,
give the other reasonable prior notice of any such Filing and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred
to in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_) and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in
connection with any such Filing or communication;

(vi) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Authority or any other authority
enforcing applicable Antitrust Laws for additional information or
documentation in connection with antitrust, competition or similar matters
(including a "second request" under the HSR Act) and not extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any such
Governmental Authority or other authorities not to consummate the Merger,
except with the prior written consent of the other Party; and 

 



45 (vii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (1)
not participate in or attend any meeting (whether in person or via telephone)
with any Governmental Authority in respect of the Merger without the other
Party, (2) keep the other Party apprised with respect to any meeting or
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Merger, (3) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining
or defending this Agreement or the Merger, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority and (4) furnish the other Party with copies of all
substantive correspondence, Filings and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of any Governmental Authoritys staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Parties shall be permitted to redact any correspondence, Filing or
communication (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
applicable Law, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns. Each Party may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section_ __ _ 6.05(b)_ shall not apply
with respect to Tax matters.

(c) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into a
transaction relating to any asset, property, right, business or Person
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, joint
venture, strategic alliance, other business combination, asset, stock or
equity purchase or otherwise), that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.01(a)_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, a delay beyond the End Date would constitute a material
delay for purposes of the preceding sentence.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates be obligated
to take any action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate
order or other arrangement, that (i) requires the sale, divestiture, licensing
or disposition of any assets or businesses of any of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) limits the conduct
of Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries) or Parents freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its Affiliates other assets or
businesses, or (iii) in Parents reasonable judgment, would be expected to
have a material adverse impact on any of its businesses, or the businesses to
be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement, either individually or in the
aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent necessary to obtain
the HSR Clearance or any other Consent of a Governmental

 



46 Authority that is required to consummate the Merger, Parent shall agree to
propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, or disposition of the assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any assets or businesses of Parent or its Affiliates), so long as
such actions would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (or, after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries). With regard to any Governmental
Authority, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, without
Parents written consent, which may be withheld in Parents sole discretion,
take, or commit to take, any action inconsistent with the limitations set
forth in the preceding sentence. Nothing in this Agreement shall require any
party to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business or
operations in connection with obtaining the HSR Clearance or any other Consent
of a Governmental Authority, unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.05(c)_, each Party agrees to cooperate and
use reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits,
including appeals, any Claim asserted in any court or other proceeding by any
Person, including any Governmental Authority, that seeks to prevent or
prohibit or impede, interfere with or delay the consummation of the Closing.
Parent shall be entitled to direct the defense in any antitrust investigation
or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other
Person relating to the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Law,
subject to prior consultation with, and good faith consideration of the views
of, the Company (including but not limited to the activities described in
_Sections 6.04(b_ _)_ (v) and (vii)).

 

(f) Parent shall promptly notify the Company, and the Company shall notify
Parent, of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging
that such Persons Consent is or may be required in connection with the
Merger, (ii) any material notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority or Nasdaq (or any other securities market) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any Claim commenced or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, that (A) relates to or involves or
otherwise affects the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (B) relates to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the occurrence of an
event which would or would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(B) result in the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ or
_Exhibit A_ to be satisfied.

 

(g) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to obtain CFIUS
Approval as promptly as practical after the date hereof. Such reasonable best
efforts shall include promptly after the date hereof making any draft and
final filings required in connection with the CFIUS Approval in accordance
with the DPA, which draft filings shall be made within thirty (30) calendar
days hereof, unless the parties hereto agree in writing otherwise, and
providing any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of
the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review or investigation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within the timeframes required
by the DPA unless CFIUS agrees in writing to an extension of such timeframe.
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, in connection with the
efforts to obtain CFIUS Approval, (i)

 



47  cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in connection with the
CFIUS Notice, including by allowing the other party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication (orally
or in writing) received by such party from, or given by such party to, CFIUS,
including by promptly providing copies to the other party of any such written
communications and (iii) permit the other party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with CFIUS, and to
the extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in any in-person meetings with CFIUS. With respect to
Parent and Merger Sub, such reasonable best efforts shall also include taking
reasonable steps to mitigate national security concerns as may be required by
CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to take any steps in
connection with obtaining CFIUS Approval that would materially and adversely
affect the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any other business
of Parent or the ability by Parent or Merger Sub to govern the Company or any
other business of Parent. In the event that the President of the United
States acts to prohibit the Merger (a " _CFIUS Turndown_ "), this Agreement
may be terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_ or 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(iii)_.

(h) Parent shall promptly notify the Company, and the Company shall notify
Parent, of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
such Persons Consent is or may be required in connection with the Merger and
(ii) any material written notice from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any stockholder litigation arising from this Agreement or the Merger
that is brought against the Company or members of the Company Board ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any Transaction Litigation. Without limiting the preceding sentence,
the Company shall give Parent the right to (a) review and comment in advance
on all Filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall consider any such comments in
good faith, (b) consult on any settlement, understanding or other agreement
with respect to any Transaction Litigation, and the Company shall consider
any suggestions of Parent during such consultation in good faith, and (c)
participate in (at Parents sole cost), but not control, the defense of such
Transaction Litigation, and participate in any negotiation or mediation with
respect to any settlement, understanding or other agreement with respect to
any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without Parents
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company shall not offer to make or make
any payment with respect to any Transaction Litigation and shall not enter
into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to any
Transaction Litigation, except that the Company shall (i) be permitted to
offer to make or make any payment with respect to any Transaction Litigation
and to enter into any settlement, understanding or other agreement relating to
any Transaction Litigation, if the terms thereof, in the aggregate, are no
less favorable to the Company that those described in _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter and (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed as to
the status of any such offer or payment pursuant to clause (i) of this
proviso.

 



48 Section 6.07 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) directly resulting
from the Merger by each individual who shall be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.08 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to (a) a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, a Recommendation Change Notice, a Company
Takeover Proposal, a Superior Company Proposal or any matter related to any of
the foregoing that complies with _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, (b) any dispute
between or among the Parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (c) a press release or other public
statement that is consistent in all material respects with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made by a Party in
accordance with this Agreement, including in investor conference calls,
filings with the SEC, QandAs or other publicly disclosed documents, in each case
under this clause (c) to the extent such disclosure is still accurate, the
Parties shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other written
public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not
issue any such press release or make any such written public statement prior
to such consultation, except to the extent such Party reasonably concludes may
be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to
any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system, in which case such Party shall use reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Parties before issuing such press release or
making such written public statement. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to this Agreement shall be in
a form agreed to by the Parties. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ shall
limit the ability of any Party to make internal announcements to its
respective employees that are consistent in all material respects with the
prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 _Fees, Costs, Expenses_ _and Proceeds_. Except as provided
otherwise in this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_ and _Article

Agreement) prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (a) deposit such
Claims Proceeds into a separate account, (b) not encumber such Claims
Proceeds or otherwise subject such Claims Proceeds to any Lien and (c) at the

the CVR Agreement).

 

Section 6.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company Entities as provided in their
respective Organizational Documents and in any indemnification or other
similar agreements of any Company Entity, in each case, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms (it being agreed

 



49  that after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory rather than
permissive, if applicable), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their respective obligations
thereunder. Parent shall not permit any such indemnification, advancement of
expenses or exculpation provision to be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the Company Indemnified Parties thereunder, unless any
such amendment, repeal or modification is required by applicable Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each individual who
was prior to or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to
the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of any Company Entity or
who was prior to or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of any Company
Entity as a director, officer or employee of another Person (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any Claim,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated by
this Agreement)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of any Company
Entity or is or was serving at the request of any Company Entity as a
director, officer or employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law. In the event of any such Claim, (i) each Company
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any such Claim from Parent within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt by Parent from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by applicable Law or the
applicable Company Entitys Organizational Documents or any applicable
indemnification agreement, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to
indemnification and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
in good faith in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, assume the covenants and agreements set forth in this  _Section_
__ _ 6.10_.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for the Company and its current
and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors
and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company, in either case, of not less than the existing coverage and
having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that

 



50  occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having a
comparable credit rating to the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any
one (1) policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and, if Parent or the Surviving Corporation is unable to
obtain the insurance required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for the years within such six (6) year period for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such
period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may,
at its option, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Company and its
current and former directors, officers and employees who are currently covered
by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage
in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not
less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time for a period of not less than
six (6) years after the Closing Date; _provided_ that in no event shall the
cost of any such tail insurance in respect of any one (1) policy year exceed
the Maximum Amount. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain
such policies in full force and effect for the applicable period of
time specified in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
all of which, are express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _
6.10_ and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to perform all of their respective
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

Section 6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by applicable
local Law, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_
"), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
individual who is employed by a Company Entity immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who remains employed thereafter by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries (each a " _Continuing_
_Company_ _Personnel_ ") with (i) base salary and wage rate that are no less
favorable than the base salary and wage rate provided to each such Continuing
Company Personnel immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) target level
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the
target level cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such
Continuing Company Personnel immediately prior to the Effective Time; and
(iii) other compensation and employee 

 



51  benefits (excluding the value of any equity incentive compensation
opportunities) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits provided to such Continuing Company Personnel immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have no
obligation to grant equity-based compensation to Continuing Company Personnel.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to provide, severance
payments and benefits to each Continuing Company Personnel whose employment is
terminated during such period that are no less favorable than the
severance payments and benefits that are provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such termination.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to, assume and
honor all obligations under the employment, severance, retention, termination
and change of control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
between a Company Entity and any Continuing Company Personnel in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
hereby acknowledges that the Closing shall constitute a "change in control"
(or similar term) of the Company under the terms of the Company Benefit
Plans, as applicable.

(d) Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by
applicable local Law (and except as otherwise agreed to by the Company,
Merger Sub and, if required by applicable local Law, the Continuing Company
Personnel), for all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension accrual or other plan providing for post-employment benefits) under
the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries (exclusive of any
Company Entity) providing benefits to any Continuing Company Personnel after
the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Company Personnel
shall be credited with his or her years of service with any Company Entity and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent
as such Continuing Company Personnel was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Company Personnel participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Closing Date (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Company Personnel shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable
coverage under an Old Plan, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing
Company Personnel, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause
(1) all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Company Personnel and his or
her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or
waived under the comparable Old Plans of any Company Entity in which such
Continuing Company Personnel participated immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (2) any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Company
Personnel and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Company Personnels
participation in the

 



52  corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Company Personnel and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

(e) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may, in its sole discretion, pay to each
participant in an annual incentive plan or program maintained by any Company
Entity (each, a " _Company Incentive Plan_ ") for the year in which the
Closing occurs a cash bonus in an amount equal to the payment that such
participant would receive based on actual achievement through the Closing
Date, and prorated for the number of days each such participant was employed
during the applicable performance period through the Closing Date.
Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall establish an annual
incentive plan or plans for the remainder of the year in which the Effective
Time occurs, which annual incentive plans shall provide Continuing Company
Personnel with a bonus opportunity at least equal to that provided under the
applicable Company Incentive Plan, prorated for the remainder of such year.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is
intended to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an
amendment to any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and
no Company Personnel or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement including in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment). Nothing in this
Agreement shall alter the at-will employment relationship of any Continuing
Company Personnel. 

(g) Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the
terms of each collective bargaining agreement, collective bargaining
relationship, work rules or practices, or any similar agreement applicable to
any Continuing Company Personnel until such agreement otherwise expires
pursuant to its terms or is modified by the parties thereto.

 

(h) The Company and its Affiliates shall, and Parent and its Affiliates
shall, cooperate fully in meeting any information and consulting obligations
or otherwise discussing or negotiating with, relevant Employee
Representatives. The Company shall complete, or cause to be completed, prior
to the Closing, and Parent shall assist and cooperate fully with the Company
in causing to be completed, all notifications to, and all consultations with,
employees, Employee Representatives, labor boards and relevant Governmental
Authorities concerning the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, and at the direction of Parent, which shall be
given no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to terminate any Company
Benefit Plans effective as of the Closing, except to the extent that doing so
would violate the terms of any collective bargaining agreement, collective
bargaining relationship, work rules or practices, or any similar agreement
applicable to any Continuing Company Personnel.

 



53 Section 6.12 _Company Convertible Special Stock._ Parent shall, to the
extent applicable, cause the Surviving Corporation to prepare and execute an
amendment to the Certificate of Designation with respect to the Company
Convertible Special Stock, effective upon any Reorganization Event (as defined

that shall be as nearly equivalent as is possible to the adjustments provided
for in Section 8 of the Certificate of Designation. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall direct its

covenant or agreement in this Agreement shall also be a breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by Parent.

 

Section 6.14 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration._ Prior to the

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be

the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.15 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the CVR Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their
respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the CVR Agreement may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any
Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
CVR Agreement.

 

Section 6.16 _Nonregistrable_ _CVRs._ Parent and the Company shall
cooperate, including by making changes to the form of CVR Agreement attached

Effective Time as if made at and as of the Effective Time, except where the
failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct

(a) _Termination_ _by Mutual Agreement_. The Company and Parent shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective

mutual written agreement.

 

(b) _Termination by Either the Company or Parent_. Each of the Company and
Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the
date that is nine months after the date of this Agreement (the " _End Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if on the End Date all of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, _Section_ __ _ 7.02_ and  _Section_ __ _
7.03_ have been satisfied (or, with respect to the conditions that by their
terms must be satisfied at the Closing would have been so satisfied if the
Closing would have occurred) other than the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.01(a)_ (to the extent such Legal Restraint arises under any Antitrust
Law and shall not have become final and nonappealable) or _Section_ __ _
7.01(d)_, then either Parent or the Company may extend the End Date for a
period of ninety (90) days, and thereafter for an additional period of sixty
(60) days (as so extended, the " _Extended End Date_ ") by delivery of written
notice of such extension to the other party not less than three (3) Business
Days prior to the End Date (or the first Extended End Date, as applicable);
_provided_ , that neither the Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ if it (or, in the case of
Parent, Merger Sub) is in breach of any of its covenants or agreements and
such breach has primarily caused or primarily resulted in the failure of the
Closing to have occurred on or prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the End
Date (or the Extended End Date, as applicable);

 

(ii) the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.01(a)_ is not satisfied
and the Legal Restraint giving rise to such nonsatisfaction has become final
and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b_ _)(_ _ii)_ shall not
be available to any Party if a failure of such Party to comply with its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement primarily caused or primarily
resulted in such failure to satisfy the condition set forth in  _Section_ __
_ 7.01(a)_; or

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company
Stockholders Meeting duly convened (unless such Company Stockholders Meeting
has been adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof).

 



57 (c) _Termination by the Company_. The Company shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement prior to the Closing:

(i) in order to enter into a definitive, written Contract with respect to
a Superior Company Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02_;
_provided_ that (1) the Company has complied in all material respects with its
material obligations under Section 6.02(c) and (2) such termination shall not
be effective unless the Company pays Parent the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ prior to or concurrently with such
termination; or

covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement, which
breach (1) would reasonably be expected to prevent the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.03_, (2) would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Merger and (3) (A) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date or
(B) if reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End
Date, the Company has delivered to Parent written notice of such breach and
such breach is not cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, by the
earlier of (1) the End Date and (2) the date that is thirty (30) days after
delivery of such notice; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
8.01(c)(ii)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of its
covenants, agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement; or

(iii) if a CFIUS Turndown has occurred; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(iii)_ if the Companys failure to comply with _Article
VI_ has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the CFIUS Turndown.

(d) _Termination by Parent_. Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement prior to the Closing if:

(i) (A) the Company Board makes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ or (B) if the Company shall be in
intentional and material breach of its obligations under _Section_ __ _
6.02_; _provided_ that Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(_ _i_ _)_ shall expire upon the Company
Stockholder Approval having been obtained; or

 

(ii) the Company materially breaches any of its respective covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement (other than an
intentional and material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.02_), which breach (1)
would reasonably be expected to prevent the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.02_, and (2) (A) is not reasonably capable of
being cured by the Company by the End Date or (B) if reasonably capable of
being cured by the Company by the End Date, Parent has delivered to the
Company written notice of such breach and such breach is not cured by the
Company by the earlier of (1) the End Date and (2) the date that is thirty
(30) days after delivery of such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __
_ 8.01(d)(ii)_ if Parent is then in material breach of any of its covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties in this Agreement; or

 



58 (iii) a CFIUS Turndown has occurred; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
8.01(d)(iii)_ if Parents failure to comply with _Article VI_ has been the
primary cause of, or resulted in, the CFIUS Turndown.

(e) _Termination Procedure_. This Agreement may be terminated only
pursuant to _Sections 8.01(a)_  _(d)_. Termination of this Agreement shall
not require the approval of the Company Stockholders. In order to terminate
this Agreement, the Party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give
written notice of such termination to the other Parties in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 9.02_, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

 

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, this Agreement shall
immediately become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of any Party (or any stockholder, Affiliate or
Representative thereof), whether arising before or after such termination,
based on, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common
law or by statute) or in equity), except for (a) the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 6.04(a)_, the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.04(c)_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.09_, this  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.05_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions shall survive such
termination, and (b) without limiting  _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_ or _Section_
__ _ 8.03(c)_, liability of any Party (whether or not the terminating Party)
for fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination,
which liabilities shall survive the termination of this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means a breach of this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the
breaching Party with the knowledge or intent that the taking of, or the
omission of taking, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause
or constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.03 _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(a) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.01(d)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $50 million
in cash (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "). In the event of a termination
under _Section_ __ _ 8.01(c)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company shall pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in writing by Parent) by
wire transfer of immediately available funds concurrently with or prior to,
and as a condition to the effectiveness of, such termination. In the event of
a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ , the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent (to an account designated in
writing by Parent) by wire transfer of immediately available funds no later
than three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination.

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent or the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(iii)_ or
(ii) Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)(ii)_, then, in case of either
clause (i) or (ii), if (A) at or prior to such termination, a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed or shall
have otherwise become publicly known or shall have been communicated or made
known to the Companys 

 



59  management or the Company Board and not publicly withdrawn as of the date of
such termination (in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i)
or Section 8.01(d)(ii)) or the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of a
termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii)), and (B) within nine (9) months
after such termination, the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into a
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal,
a Company Takeover Proposal is consummated or the Company or the Company Board
approves or recommends any Company Takeover Proposal (in each case, whether or
not such Company Takeover Proposal is the same Company Takeover Proposal
described in clause (A) above), then the Company shall pay Parent the Company
Termination Fee, which payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds no later than three (3) Business Days after the date of the
event giving rise to the obligation to make such payment; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, references in
the definition of Company Takeover Proposal to "20% or more" shall be
replaced with references to "more than 50%".

(c) If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which the
Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _
8.03(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_, upon payment in full of the Company
Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further liability with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be Parents sole and exclusive
remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and any
other Person in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not have, and
each expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse
(whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity). In no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.
In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason at a
time when Parent would have had the right to terminate this Agreement, Parent
shall be entitled to receipt of the Company Termination Fee that would have
been (or would have subsequently become) payable had Parent terminated this
Agreement at such time.

 

(d) The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and,
without such provisions, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that the payment of the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty
but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall compensate
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates in the circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise
be impossible to calculate with precision.

 



60 Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified, or
supplemented in any and all respects at any time before or after receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment
that by Law requires further approval by the Company Stockholders, (b) no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (c)
except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall require
the approval of the stockholders of Parent or the Company Stockholders. Any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be effective only if it is
set forth in an instrument in writing executed by each Party.

 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.04_,
waive compliance with any covenants and agreements in this Agreement or (d)
waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions in this Agreement to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a Party to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver or extension is to be
effective. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

ARTICLE IX

Section 9.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party or
such Party waives its rights under this _Section_ __ _ 9.03_ with respect
thereto. Upon any determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 

Section 9.04 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one (1) or
more counterparts (including by means of email in .pdf format), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective
when one (1) or more counterparts have been signed by each Party and delivered
to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.05 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Disclosure Letters), the CVR
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement (except for paragraphs 5, 6 and
10 of the Confidentiality Agreement), constitute the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between or among the Parties or their Affiliates with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

(b) Except (i) as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.09_,  _Section_ __ _
6.10_, and (ii) after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company
Common Stock to receive the applicable consideration for such Company Common
Stock in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.02_,
each Party agrees that (1) their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement and (2) this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies under this
Agreement, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement.

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, and all Claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate

 



63  to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance, consummation
or subject matter of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware.

 

Section 9.07 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that Parent and Merger
Sub may, upon prior written notice to the Company, assign all or any of their
rights and obligations hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, so long as (a) Parent continues to remain liable for all
of such obligations as if no such assignment had occurred and (b) such
assignment in no way causes a delay or impairs the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Subject to
the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 9.08 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each
other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, in any court referred to in _Section_ __ _ 9.09_, without
proof of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.09 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. All Claims arising from, under or in
connection with this Agreement shall be raised to and exclusively determined
by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the extent such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
each such court to whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally
consent and submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any such Claim in such court
and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to the respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ shall be
effective service of process for any Claim brought against such Party in any
such court. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions

 



64  contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 

Section 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

 

Section 9.11 _Construction_. Each Party has participated in the drafting
and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by
all the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) _Time Periods_. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or after which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to
this Agreement, (i) the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period shall be excluded and (ii) if the last day of such period is not a
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day. All references in this Agreement to a number of days are to such
number of calendar days unless Business Days are specified.

 

(b) _Dollars_. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, any reference in
this Agreement to $ means U.S. dollars. 

(c) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

(d) _Articles, Sections and Headings_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



65 (e) _Include_. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."
