(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated pursuant to _Article X_, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten (10) Business Days
thereafter), Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act)

the Offer, there be validly tendered (not including Company Shares tendered
pursuant to procedures for guaranteed delivery) and not withdrawn in
accordance with the terms of the Offer that number of Company Shares
which, together with the number of Company Shares, if any, then owned
beneficially by Parent, any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition
Sub, constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then outstanding
Company Shares on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, as of any time,
the number of Company Shares outstanding, together with all Shares (if any)
which the Company would be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding
warrants, options, restricted stock units, securities convertible or
exchangeable into Shares or other binding obligations, but only to the extent
then so exercisable, convertible or exchangeable or exercisable, convertible

(b) Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions
to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or

shall not permit Acquisition Sub to) (i) waive the Minimum Condition, the
condition set forth in clause (A) of _Annex A_ or the condition set forth in
clause (C)(1) of _Annex A_ , and (ii) make any change in the terms of
or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be
paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the Offer Price or the number of Company
Shares sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a manner
permitted or required by the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(ii)_, (D) imposes
conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex A_ , (E) modifies
the conditions set forth in _Annex A_ to make any of them more onerous,
or (F) amends any other term of the Offer in any manner that is adverse to
the holders of Shares.

 



13 (c) _Adjustments to the Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to Acquisition Subs
acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Shares that are tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_.

 

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York Time, on the date

with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the date
the Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the event that the Offer is extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, then the Offer shall expire
on the date and at the time to which the Offer has been so extended.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)(i)_ or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement: 

(A) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any Law
or Order, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or
its staff or Nasdaq, in any such case which is applicable to the Offer;

(B) in the event that any of the Antitrust Condition, the Illegality
Condition or the Government Litigation Condition is not satisfied or waived
(if permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer
(but, in the case of the Illegality Condition or the Government Litigation
Condition, only to the extent that the failure of such condition to be
satisfied or waived is as a result of a Law, Order or Legal Proceeding
described therein relating to applicable Antitrust Laws), Acquisition Sub
shall extend the Offer for successive extension periods of between one (1) and
twenty (20) Business Days each in order to permit the satisfaction of the
Antitrust Condition, the Illegality Condition or the Government Litigation
Condition, as the case may be;

(C) in the event that any condition to the Offer (other than any such
condition described in paragraph (B) above) is not satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) as of any then scheduled expiration of the Offer,

extend the Offer for successive extension periods of between one (1) and
twenty (20) Business Days each in order to permit the satisfaction of all such

(3) Business Day period following such delivery of such Recommendation Change

_Section 10.1(e)_;

_provided, however_ , that the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) or (D)of this
_Section 2.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise
restrict in any manner the right of the parties to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Article X_ and _provided_ , _further_ , that
Acquisition Sub shall not extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date without
the consent of the Company.

 

(iii) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer in any manner
other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.1(d)(ii)_ without the prior written consent of the Company.

(iv) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Article X_, in which case Acquisition
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one
Business Day) after such termination of this Agreement.

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for (or have paid for
on its behalf by an Affiliate of Parent), all Company Shares that are validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning
of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration
of the Offer. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub (or such Affiliate of
Parent paying on Acquisition Subs behalf) on a timely basis the funds
necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, without interest, subject to
reduction for any applicable withholding taxes payable in respect thereof.

(f) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If upon the acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub collectively do not beneficially own at
least 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding, Acquisition Sub may (but
shall not be required to), and the Offer to Purchase shall reserve the right
to, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (within the meaning of Rule
14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of not less than three (3) nor more
than twenty (20) Business Days immediately following the expiration of the
Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer,
Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) accept for
payment, and pay for (or have paid for on its behalf by an Affiliate of
Parent), all Company Shares that are validly tendered during the "subsequent
offering period" promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) after any such Company Shares are validly tendered
during the "subsequent 

 



15  offering period." Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent
shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Sub (or such Affiliate of
Parent paying on Acquisition Subs behalf) on a timely basis the funds
necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated
to purchase during such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Price payable
in respect of each Company Share that is validly tendered during the
"subsequent offering period" shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash,
without interest, subject to reduction for any applicable withholding taxes
payable in respect thereof.

 

(g) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is first commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act), Parent and Acquisition Sub shall:

the Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule

Shares as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.

recommendations of the Company Board set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ and
_Section 6.3(a)_ that relate to the Offer. The Company shall furnish

Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably determined by Parent to be
required by applicable Law and reasonably requested by Parent to be included
in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents so as to enable Parent and
Acquisition Sub to comply with their obligations under this _Section 2.1(g)_.
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to
determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary or
reasonably appropriate to include in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents
in order to satisfy applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its
respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents or other
representatives for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all

 



16  steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so

2.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) _Company Determinations, Approvals and Recommendations_. The Company
hereby approves and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants to
Parent and Acquisition Sub that, at a meeting duly called and held prior to

conditions set forth herein:

(i) determined that this Agreement is advisable;

including the Offer and the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on
terms that are in the best interests of the Company and the holders of Company
Shares;

 

(iii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger), which approval, to the extent
applicable, constituted approval under the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL as a result of which this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are not and will not be subject to
the provisions of, or any restrictions under, the provisions of Section 203
of the DGCL; and

(iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer, tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
and, if required by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that such recommendation may be withheld,
withdrawn, amended or modified in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.3._

 



17 The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations
and approvals in the Offer Documents and, to the extent that the foregoing
recommendation of the Company Board is not withheld, withdrawn, amended or
modified in accordance with _Section 6.3_, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of such recommendation in the Offer Documents. To the knowledge
of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, all of the Companys
directors and executive officers intend to tender all Shares beneficially
owned by them to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer, except as otherwise

Company Stockholders, to the extent reasonably practical together with the
Offer Documents, promptly after the commencement of the Offer (within the

of the determinations, approvals and recommendations of the Company Board
(including the Company Board Recommendation) set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_
and _Section 6.3(a)_. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall furnish in
writing to the Company all information concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub
that is reasonably determined by the Company to be required by applicable Law
and reasonably requested by the Company to be included in the Schedule 14D-9
so as to enable the Company to comply with its obligations under this _Section
2.2(b)_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
to determine the information regarding the Company that is necessary
or reasonably appropriate to include in the Schedule 14D-9 in order to
satisfy applicable Laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents or other representatives
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Unless the Company Board has
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel (it being
understood that Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall provide any
comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). Unless the Company Board
has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide
in writing to Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after such receipt, and unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of
any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such response, to which
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith 

 



18  consideration to any comments made by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
counsel) and, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Company in its
reasonable discretion, to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its
staff regarding any such comments.

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, furnish Parent and Acquisition Sub with
such assistance and such information as Parent or its agents may reasonably
request in order to disseminate and otherwise communicate the Offer to the
record and beneficial holders of Company Shares, including a list, as of the
most recent practicable date, of the stockholders of the Company, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer files containing the names and
addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Company Shares, and lists
of security positions of Company Shares held in stock depositories (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of securities
positions). Subject to applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Merger, with respect to any information received by Parent
and Acquisition Sub pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(c)_, Parent and
Acquisition Sub (and their respective agents) shall:

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions;

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Article X_, and
(B) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall withdraw the Offer, promptly return (and
shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause their agents to
deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from
such information then in their possession or control.

2.3 _Company Board of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Acquisition Sub of Company Shares pursuant
to the Offer (the "Appointment Time," the use of which term herein shall not,
unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether Parent shall
exercise its rights under this _Section 2.3(a)_) and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate up to such number of
directors on the Company Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next
whole number) obtained by multiplying (x) the number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to any increase in the number of directors
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_) and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub
(giving effect to the Company Shares accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer), and the denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding
Company Shares. Following a request by Parent, the Company shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate of incorporation of
the Company, take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated
by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including (at the
direction of Parent) by increasing the size of the Company Board or by seeking
and accepting or otherwise securing the resignations of such number of then
incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals 

 



19  so designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board.
From time to time after the Appointment Time, at the request of Parent, the
Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and the certificate
of incorporation of the Company, take all action necessary to cause the
individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same
percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on (i)
each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of each
Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each committee of each such board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly
amend, or cause to be amended, its bylaws, if necessary to comply with the
obligations of the Company pursuant to this Section 2.3. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, from the Appointment Time until the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company Board to
always include at least such number of directors who are directors on the date
hereof, who are not employed by the Company, who are not Affiliates or
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and who are independent
directors in order to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq
(the "Continuing Directors"); _provided_  that, if the number of Continuing
Directors shall be reduced below those necessary to satisfy the continued
listing requirements of Nasdaq, for any reason whatsoever, the remaining
Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who
shall not be an Affiliate or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; _provided further_ , that
the remaining Continuing Director shall fill such vacancies as soon as
practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days, and further
_provided_ that if no such Continuing Director is appointed in such time
period, Parent shall designate such Continuing Director; _provided further_ ,
that if no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate two (2) Persons who shall not be Affiliates, consultants,
representatives or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill
such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement.

(b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to appoint
Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder and the Companys
receipt of sufficient information from Parent to enable the Company to include
in the Schedule 14D-9 the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in respect of
Parents designees to the Company Board. The Company shall take all action
required pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include
in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its
directors and officers, as well as Parents designees to the Company Board, as
is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company in
writing, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to itself
and its designees to the Company Board required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

(c)  _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, following the election or appointment of
Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ and
until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall

 



20  constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the
part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of
this Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement
requiring action by the Company Board, (iii) any extension of time for
performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Acquisition
Sub, (iv) any exercise, enforcement or waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company and
(v) any amendment of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company that would adversely affect the Company Stockholders; _provided
however,_ that following the Appointment Time, Parent may cause its designees
elected or appointed pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ to withdraw or modify any
Company Board Recommendation Change. The Continuing Directors shall have the
authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company)
at the expense of the Company for the purpose of fulfilling their
obligations hereunder, and shall have the authority, after the Appointment
Time but prior to the Effective Time, to institute any action on behalf of the
Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Acquisition Sub an option (the
"Top-Up Option"), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this _Section 2.4_, to purchase that number of authorized and unissued
Company Shares (the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the lowest number of
Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares beneficially
owned by Parent and/or Acquisition Sub at the time of such exercise, shall
constitute 100 Company Shares more than 90% of the Company Shares then
outstanding on a fully diluted basis (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided,
however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless immediately
after such exercise and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto,
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of Parents other wholly-owned Subsidiaries
would own more than 90% of the Company Shares then outstanding (assuming the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); and _provided further_ , that in no
event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable (A) for a number of
Company Shares in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares
of Company Common Stock or (B) if any applicable Law (which for the avoidance
of doubt shall not include the rules of Nasdaq) or any applicable Order shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares.

(b) Provided that no applicable Law (which for the avoidance of doubt shall
not include the rules of Nasdaq) or Order shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect thereof,
Acquisition Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at
any one time after the Appointment Time and prior to the earlier to occur of
(i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-
Up Option Shares being purchased by Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option
Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid
by Acquisition Sub, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) in
cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up
Option Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a full recourse
promissory note having a principal 

 



21  amount equal to the remainder of such purchase price. Any such promissory
note shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending rate
prevailing during the period in which any portion of the principal amount of
such promissory note remains outstanding, as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis on the outstanding principal amount of
such promissory note from the date such promissory note is originally issued
until the date of payment in full of such promissory note, and may be prepaid
without premium or penalty. The unpaid principal amount and accrued interest
under the promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in
the event that (x) Acquisition Sub fails to make any payment of interest on
the promissory note as provided therein and such failure continues for a
period of 30 days or (y) Acquisition Sub files any petition under any
bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors.

(c) In the event Acquisition Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Acquisition Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice (the "Top-Up Notice")
setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Option Shares that Acquisition Sub
intends to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which
Acquisition Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Option
Shares by Acquisition Sub is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause to be
delivered to the Company the consideration required to be delivered in
exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Acquisition Sub a
certificate representing such Top-Up Option Shares. The parties hereto agree
to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of
such Top-Up Option Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is
deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.2_, and if not so
consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and as contemplated by
_Section 8.3(c)_ as close in time as possible to (including, to the extent
possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(d) Parent and Acquisition Sub understand that the Company Shares which
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Acquisition Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Acquisition Sub
is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option
Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

3.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

(i) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Acquisition
Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(ii) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (A) shares of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or
the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), without interest thereon, upon 

 



24  the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.8_ (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner
provided in _Section 3.10_).

(iii) _Owned Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company
Common Stock occurring on or after the consummation of the Offer and prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.7(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all
Dissenting Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to
appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL
shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in
the manner provided in _Section 3.8_.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The parties
agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the
Dissenting Company Shares and to the fullest

 



25  extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair value of the Dissenting Company
Shares shall be determined in accordance with Section 262(h) of the DGCL
without regard to the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up Option Shares or any
consideration paid or delivered by Parent or Acquisition Sub to the Company in
payment for the Top-Up Option Shares.

(d) _Company RSUs_. Parent shall not assume any Company RSUs in connection
with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, except
as otherwise agreed to by Parent and a holder of a Company RSU, the Company
shall take all such action as may be necessary so that immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (i) each Company RSU that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not vested) shall be
cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, and (ii) each holder of
each such Company RSU shall be paid by the Company at or promptly after
the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_, an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the aggregate
number of shares or fractional shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Company RSU (assuming full vesting of such Company RSU), _by_ (y) the
Offer Price. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 3.7(d)_ under all Company Stock
Plans and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering
all notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof.

(e) _Company Options_.

(i) Parent shall not assume any Vested Company Options in connection with the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company
shall take such action as may be necessary so that immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (i) each Vested Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as
of the Effective Time, and (ii) in consideration of such cancellation and
termination, each holder of each such Vested Company Option shall be paid by
the Company promptly following the Effective Time, subject to Section 3.8(e),
an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable upon exercise of such Vested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the Offer Price, less the per share
exercise price of such Vested Company Option.

(ii) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at
the Effective Time each Unvested Company Option shall be assumed by Parent
(each, an "Assumed Option"). Each such Assumed Option shall be subject to the
same terms and conditions as applied to the related Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule
applicable thereto, except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (ii) the per
share exercise price of the Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
each Assumed Option shall be equal to the

 



26  quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option
Exchange Ratio, with the resulting price per share rounded up to the nearest
whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed Option so
assumed by Parent shall qualify following the Effective Time as an incentive
stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted
under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent such Assumed Option qualifies
as an incentive stock option prior to the Effective Time and, further, that
the assumption of Unvested Company Options pursuant to this Section shall
be effected in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Sections 409A and
424(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and
this _Section 3.7(e)_ will be construed consistent with this intent.

 

(iii) With respect to Company Options a portion of which is vested and a
portion of which is unvested, this _Section 3.7(e)_ shall be applied by
treating the vested portion as a separate Vested Company Option and the
unvested portion as a separate Unvested Company Option.

(iv) The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.7(e)_ under all Company Option agreements and
any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all
required notices and making any determinations and/or resolutions of the
Company Board or a committee thereof. Parent shall take all actions reasonably
necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance or transfer a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of the Assumed Options. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form
S-8, to the extent such form is available, registering a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under this
_Section 3.7(e)_ .

(f) _Company ESPP_.

(i) Prior to the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to cause the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect
to any offering period then underway to be determined by treating the last
Business Day prior to, or if more administratively advisable, the last
payroll date of the Company immediately prior to, the Appointment Time, as
the last day of such offering period and by making such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened and final offering
period but otherwise treating such shortened and final offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Company ESPP.

(ii) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company ESPP
shall terminate immediately following the Appointment Time. All amounts
withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP
that have not been used to purchase Company Common Stock prior to the
Effective Time will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant
to the terms of the Company ESPP.

 



27 (iii) The Company agrees to take any and all actions necessary to approve and
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this _Section 3.7(f)_ including making
any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof.

 

3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the "Payment Agent").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, an
amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which holders of
Company Common Stock become entitled under this _Article III_. Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (such cash amount being referred to herein as the
"Exchange Fund"). Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses
with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to
promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article III_, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make
such payments contemplated by this _Article III_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Dissenting Company Shares) and (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"), in each case, whose shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent), and/or (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this 
_Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate that were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_, by
(y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in
respect thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may 

 



28  reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in respect thereof), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this  _Section 3.8_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person
requesting such payment has paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required to be paid by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) that such transfer and other similar Taxes have been paid or are
otherwise not payable.

(e)  _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, and any agent of any of the
foregoing, shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under United States federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld
(and remitted, to the extent required by applicable Law, to the applicable
Governmental Authority) such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



29 (g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any
claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Company Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.8_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
III_.

3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Acquisition Sub, the directors and officers of
the Company and Acquisition Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary
action.

the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent

good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to

bylaws, as amended to date, of the Company. The Company is not in violation of
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than in the case of the
consummation of the Merger, obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and

Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other constituent documents of
any of the Companys Subsidiaries, (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set

required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, any
Material Contract, (c) assuming the Consents referred to in _Section 4.4_ are
obtained and made and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject

Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
any of their properties or assets are bound, or (d) result in the creation of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses
(b), (c) and (d) above, for such violations, conflicts, defaults,
terminations, accelerations or Liens which would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially
delay the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
or the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder. 

4.5 _Required Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, Order or
authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of
the foregoing being referred to herein as a "Consent"), any Governmental

any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,

not been or occurred, and there does not exist, any Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date through the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take

and other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of

to the agreement (such agreements, the "Company Intellectual Property
Agreements"). To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, there
are no pending disputes regarding the scope of such Company Intellectual
Property Agreements, performance under the Company Intellectual Property

owned by another Person have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement
with such Person or was otherwise lawful, except to the extent that any use or
disclosure of any Trade Secret owned by another Person that was not done in
accordance with a written agreement would not have, individually or in the

the Company and its Subsidiaries have a policy requiring employees and
certain consultants and contractors who are or were involved in, or who have
participated in or contributed to, the conception, development, creation or
reduction to practice of any Intellectual Property for the Company or of any
of its Subsidiaries, to execute a confidentiality and assignment agreement
that provides that the Company or its Subsidiaries owns all Intellectual
Property Rights therein (subject to limitations on the assignment of
Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights imposed by applicable
Law, including but not limited to California Labor Code Section 2870) and that

Intellectual Property.

Company and its Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order that restricts or
impairs the use of any material Company Intellectual Property Rights, other
than restrictions or impairments that would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
not result in (i) the Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party
any rights or licenses to any Company Intellectual Property Rights except as
set forth in any of the Company Intellectual Property Agreements, (ii) any
third Person that is a party to a Company Intellectual Property Agreement
having the right to terminate the applicable Company Intellectual Property

compliance in all material respects with all applicable privacy policies,
terms of use, and applicable Laws. The transactions contemplated to be
consummated hereunder will not violate any privacy policy, terms of use, or
applicable Laws relating to the use, dissemination, or transfer of any such
data or information, except as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) The participation by the Company and its Subsidiaries in any standards
setting or other industry organization is in material compliance with all
rules, requirements, and other obligations of any such organization.

 



41 (j) No federal, state, local or other governmental entity nor any university,
college, or academic institution has ownership rights in any Owned Company
Intellectual Property that is material to the business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries other than pursuant to a valid, nonexclusive license
granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, no product or
service of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is distributed with any
Software that is licensed pursuant to an "open source" or other third-party
license agreement that requires the disclosure or licensing of any source
code for any Software owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries and included
within a product or service of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any
Company Intellectual Property Rights.

copies of (A) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 required to have been

414 of the Code), (2) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA), (3) a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 4063 or 4064 of
ERISA) (in each case under clause (1), (2) or (3) whether or not subject to

any current or former ERISA Affiliate within the six-year period immediately
prior to the date hereof.

(c) Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
material compliance with its terms and with all applicable Law, including the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. 

(d) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, each Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code has been operated and administered in compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

(e) As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Proceedings (or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, investigations by a Governmental Authority) pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened on behalf of, against or
otherwise involving any Employee Plan, the assets of any trust under any
Employee Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator or any fiduciary or any
Employee Plan with respect to the administration or operation of such plans,
other than routine claims for benefits that have been or are being handled
through an administrative claims procedure.

 



44 (f) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has,
with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to result
in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a material tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case
applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan or for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification
obligation.

 

(g) No Employee Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" within the meaning of

has occurred or exists since the date of such determination or opinion letter
that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Employee Plan.

(i) To the extent applicable, each International Employee Plan has been
approved by the relevant taxation and other Governmental Authorities so as to
enable: (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the participants and
beneficiaries under the relevant International Employee Plan and (ii) in the
case of any International Employee Plan under which resources are set aside in
advance of the benefits being paid (a "Funded International Employee Plan"),
the assets held for the purposes of the Funded International Employee Plans,
to enjoy the most favorable taxation status possible and the Company is not
aware of any ground on which such approval may reasonably be expected to
cease to apply.

(j) Neither the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (A)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, or (C) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit
or compensation. No amount paid or payable by the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) could be an "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No person is entitled to receive any
additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment) from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of the excise
taxes required by section 4999 of the Code or any taxes required by section
409A of the Code.

 



45 (k) All material required contributions, premiums and other payments required
to be made with respect to any Employee Plan have been timely made, accrued or
reserved for.

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and there currently
exists no condition or set of facts in connection with which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries could be reasonably be expected to be subject to any
liability (other than routine benefits liabilities) under the terms of any
Employee Plan, ERISA, the Code or applicable regulatory guidance issued by any
Governmental Authority, Collective Bargaining Agreement or any other
applicable Law.

(m) Except as required by applicable Law or this Agreement, no term under any
Employee Plan (other than any employment, change of control or similar
agreement or any International Employee Plan) exists which would prevent
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from
terminating or amending any Employee Plan without material liability to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).

(n) Except as required by applicable Law or the terms of any Employee Plans as
in effect on the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any plan or commitment to amend in any material respect or establish any
new Employee Plan or to continue or materially increase any benefits under any
Employee Plan.

 

(o) No deduction for federal income tax purposes is expected by the Company to
be disallowed for material remuneration paid by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

(p) The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been made or are to be
made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be granted according to
employment compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans of the
Company, including the Employee Plans (collectively, the "Arrangements"), to
certain Company Stockholders and holders of other Company Securities
(collectively, the "Covered Securityholders"). The Compensation Committee of
the Company Board (the "Company Compensation Committee") (A) at a meeting to
be held prior to the Appointment Time, will duly adopt resolutions approving
as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act
(an "Employment Compensation Arrangement") (1) each Arrangement presented to
the Company Compensation Committee on or prior to the date hereof, (2) the
treatment of the Company Options and Company RSUs in accordance with the
terms set forth in this Agreement, and (3) the terms of _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_, and (B) will take all other actions necessary to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under
the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing arrangements. Each member of
the Company Compensation Committee is an "independent director" in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (B) the
Company gives Parent not less than 24 hours prior written notice of
the identity of such Person and the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in written form, in which case
the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof) and of the Companys intention
to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish non-
public information to, such Person, (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any
non-public information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public
information to Parent to the extent such information has not been previously
furnished by the Company to Parent and (D) there has not been any material
breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the Company (including any such material
breach deemed to have occurred pursuant to _Section 6.2(d)_).

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.2_ by any directors or officers or
outside Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section 6.2_ by the Company.

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in  _Section
6.2(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
following receipt) notify Parent orally and in writing if the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries
Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, such notice to include the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry
(including a copy, if made in writing, or a written summary, if made orally),
and the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a current basis
of the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry,
and any material developments related thereto.

 

6.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to the terms of _Section 6.3(b)_ and _Section 6.3(c)_, the
Company Board shall recommend that the holders of Company Shares accept the
Offer, tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer
and, if required by the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation").

 



58 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make the Company Board Recommendation to the holders of the Company Shares,
(ii) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend,
endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that, only with respect to a tender offer or
exchange offer, taking a neutral position or no position (other than in a
communication made in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal shall be considered a
breach of this clause (iii)), (iv) fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days of a written request to do so by
Parent, (v) in the case of Acquisition Proposal that is a tender or exchange
offer, fail to have filed within ten (10) Business Days after the public
announcement of the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal a Schedule 14D-9
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act recommending that the Company Stockholders reject such Acquisition
Proposal and not tender any shares of Company Common Stock into such tender or
exchange offer, or (vi) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such
actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through
(vi) being referred to herein as a "Company Board Recommendation Change");
_provided, however_ , that a "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board to the Company Stockholders pursuant to and in compliance
with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar
communication following the public announcement or disclosure of any
Acquisition Proposal that is not a tender offer or exchange offer that is
limited to the information permitted by such rule, shall not be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if, at any time prior to the
Appointment Time, the Company Board receives a Superior Proposal or there
occurs an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change provided that (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Delaware Law, and in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company
Board approves or recommends such Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company has
notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons, including
the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and a copy of
the final form of any related agreements or a description in reasonable detail
of such Intervening Event, as the case may be, for such Company Board
Recommendation Change (a "Recommendation Change Notice") (it being understood
that the Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such
notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or amend
public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iii) if requested by
Parent, the Company shall have made its Representatives available to discuss
and negotiate in good faith with Parents Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the period
beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the day of delivery by the Company to
Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending three (3) Business
Days later at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time; and (iv) if Parent shall have delivered
to the Company a written proposal capable of being accepted by the Company to
alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such three (3)
Business Day

 



59  period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel), after considering the terms of such
proposal by Parent, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would still reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law. Any material amendment
or modification to any Superior Proposal or any material change to an
Intervening Event will be deemed to be a new Superior Proposal or Intervening
Event for purposes of this _Section 6.3_ (and require a new three (3)
Business Day period, measured as set forth above). The Company shall
keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this
Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement and to
the extent required to be disclosed in any Company SEC Reports. Effective as
of any such Company Board Recommendation Change, Sections 9 and 10 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force
and effect.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) making any disclosure to
the Company Stockholders that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be expected to be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law; _provided_ that, in
either such case, any such statement(s) or disclosures made by the
Company Board will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of _Article X_.

6.4  _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and the Appointment
Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its financial advisors, business
consultants, legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company; _provided,
however_ , that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires
the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information or (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to
a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information; _provided_ , that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent
in any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the
rights and remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder and
_provided, further,_ that the parties hereto shall use reasonable efforts to
provide for appropriate procedures to ensure the confidentiality of any
information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 6.4_. In the event that the
Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding
sentence, it shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the
applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate the
applicable Law or to waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this  _Section 6.4_ shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its

 



60  Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys properties shall be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall
not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by
Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.4_.

6.5  _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors (in their capacity as such) by any Company Stockholders (on their
own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder
litigation and agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any such
stockholder litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.6 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VII 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB

7.1 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Appointment Time (the "Indemnified Persons"). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other
similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law. 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.1(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the

 



61  Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 7.1(b)_, then the claim asserted in such
notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. In addition, during the
period commencing at the Appointment Time and ending on the sixth anniversary
of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) advance, prior to the final
disposition of any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly following request
by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) incurred by
such Indemnified Person in connection with any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified
Person to repay such advances if it is ultimately decided in a final, non-
appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any
such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to
object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be
entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by an Indemnified Person,
promptly after statements therefor are received, whether or not the Surviving
Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified Person shall be liable for
any settlement effected without his or her prior express written consent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 7.1(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of
its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with
respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 



62 (c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance ("DandO
Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms
with respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the
DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.1(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
(such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium")
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in
_Section 7.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ that, if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company or Parent may, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Insurance, provided that the aggregate annual premium for
such "tail policy" shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium paid by the
Company for its existing directors and officers liability insurance
policies during the year ended December 31, 2009. In the event that the
Company or Parent elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first
sentence of this _Section 7.1(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all
of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
_Section 7.1_.

(e) The obligations set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (or their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (or their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred
to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (or their heirs and representatives) are intended to
be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.1_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section 7.1(c)_ (or their heirs and representatives))
under this _Section 7.1_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 



63 (f) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section 7.1_ shall be joint and
several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.1_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

7.2 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Appointment Time, as applicable.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all Employee Plans and
compensation arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Appointment Time, _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating, or from causing the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate,
any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their
terms or if otherwise required by applicable Law.

(c) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
either (i) maintain for the benefit of each Continuing Employee, the Employee
Plans (or substitute plans) at benefit levels that are no less than those in
effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement
(excluding equity based benefits and individual employment agreements), and
provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee under such
Employee Plans, or (ii) provide compensation, benefits and severance payments
(other than equity based benefits and individual employment agreements) to
each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Appointment Time ("Comparable
Plans"), or (iii) provide some combination of (i) and (ii) above such that
each Continuing Employee receives compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity
based benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Appointment Time. In each case,
base salary or regular wages as of immediately prior to the Appointment Time
shall not be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time
for any Continuing Employee who continues to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or an Affiliate during that period. 

 



64 (d) To the extent that an Employee Plan or Comparable Plan is made available
to any Continuing Employee on or following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause
to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited for purposes of accrual of pension benefits or to the extent that
it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Employee Plans) (such plans,
collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under any such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participates immediately before the Appointment Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits
to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during any unfinished
portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts
of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Employee Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and
shall not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit
future accruals.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this
_Section 7.2_, require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time. No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
amend any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy or other arrangement
of the Company, Parent or any of their Affiliates.

(f) This _Section 7.2_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.2_,
expressed or implied, is

 



65  intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.2_. Without limiting
the foregoing, no provision of this  _Section 7.2_ will create any third
party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

7.3 _Obligations of Acquisition Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary
to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VIII

affecting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the ability of such
party to fully perform its obligations under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Company shall be required prior to the Effective Time to pay any

If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for

regarding the Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of
each party, as appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or
from any Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger, and (vii)
cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate
in, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all

 



67  material deliberations with respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions
set forth in clauses (A) and (C)(1) of Annex A and _Section 9.1(c)_. Any such
disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information by one party
to the other may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under
applicable Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information
or any privilege.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 8.2(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that
the parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent
or the Company to consummate the Offer and the Merger, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or
agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any
consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational
restriction, or take or commit to take any action, in each of the foregoing
cases, (i) the effectiveness or consummation of which is not conditional on
the consummation of the Offer and the Merger or (ii) that would be reasonably
likely to (A) adversely impact the benefits expected to be derived by Parent
as a result of the Transactions, other than in a _de minimis_ manner or (B)
impose material limitations on Parents ownership or operation (or that of
any of Parents Subsidiaries or Affiliates) of all or more than a _de minimis_
portion of the Companys business or assets, including Parents exercise of
rights of full ownership of the Company Shares purchased by Acquisition Sub
in the Offer on all stockholder matters. The Company shall agree, if requested
by Parent in writing, to commit to take any of the forgoing actions with
respect to the assets or business of the Company in furtherance of this
_Section 8.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such action may be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Short-Form Merger_.

(a) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, the Company shall establish a
record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Company Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") as promptly as
practicable following the Appointment Time and the end of any "subsequent
offering period" permitted pursuant to this Agreement for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

(b) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall vote all Company Shares acquired in the Offer (or otherwise
beneficially owned by it or any of its respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries
as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of

 



68  this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholder
Meeting or otherwise. Parent shall vote all of the shares of capital stock of
Acquisition Sub beneficially owned by it, or sign a written consent in lieu
of a meeting of the stockholders of Acquisition Sub, in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 8.3_, in the event that
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, shall hold at least
ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding Company Shares following
the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
shall take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as soon as practicable after such acquisition, without a meeting of
the stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

8.4  _Proxy Statement_.

(a) If the Company Stockholders are required under the DGCL to adopt this
Agreement in order to consummate the Merger, as soon as practicable following
the Appointment Time and the end of any "subsequent offering period" permitted
pursuant to this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
jointly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement
for use in connection with the solicitation of proxies from the Company
Stockholders for use at the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company, Parent
and Acquisition Sub, as the case may be, shall furnish all information
concerning the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the other hand, as the other
may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing with the
SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing thereof
with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not comment on, or
that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement. Each of the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents or other representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Laws. The Company shall provide Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel (it being understood that
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon
as soon as reasonably practicable). The Company shall provide in writing to
Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel any comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly
after such receipt, and the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation
of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its staff (including a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such response, to which
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel) and, to the extent
deemed appropriate by the Company in its reasonable discretion, to participate
in any discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any such comments.

 



69 (b) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article X_,
subject to the terms of _Section 6.3(b)_, the Company shall include the
portion of the Company Board Recommendation relating to the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement in the Proxy Statement.

8.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure
that (a) such state anti-takeover or other similar Law is rendered
inapplicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

8.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and the Appointment Time, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition Sub upon becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or
inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of
_Annex A_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder or the obligations of the Company
under _Section 6.4_; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 8.6(a)_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article X_ and the Appointment Time, Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions

 



70  contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the
ability of Parent and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective
covenants and obligations; _provided, however_ , that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent
or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and
_provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to
this  _Section 8.6(b)_.

8.7 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public
release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or announcement, shall
be at the final discretion of the disclosing party); _provided, however_ ,
that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 8.7_ shall not apply to any
release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.3_ or following a Company Board Recommendation Change.

8.8 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, made as of August 29, 2010 (as amended, the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other party or parties hereto):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer
without Acquisition Sub having accepted for payment any Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer on or before the date that is 90 days

that if at such time any of the Antitrust Condition, the Illegality Condition
or the Government Litigation Condition has not been satisfied or waived (if

Government Litigation Condition, only to the extent that the failure of such
condition to be satisfied or waived is as a result of a Law, Order or Legal
Proceeding described therein relating to applicable Antitrust Laws), then the
Termination Date shall be extended automatically until the date that is 210
days following the date hereof); _provided, however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be
available to any party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in
(i) any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ having failed
to be satisfied and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement, or (ii) the expiration or termination of the Offer
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer without
Acquisition Sub having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach of this Agreement; or

 

(c) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material
breach of its covenants, agreements and other obligations under this
Agreement, and (ii) Parent and/or Acquisition Sub shall have breached or
otherwise violated any of their respective material covenants, agreements or
other obligations under this Agreement, or any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement shall
have become inaccurate, which breach, violation or inaccuracy, individually or
in the aggregate with other such breaches, violations or inaccuracies, would
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation

 



72  of, or give Parent the right not to consummate, the Offer, and have not been
cured, prior to the later of (A) any then scheduled expiration of the Offer or
(B) 10 days after the giving of written notice by the Company to Parent and
Purchaser of such breach, violation or inaccuracy; or

in material breach of their respective covenants, agreements and other
obligations under this Agreement, and (ii) the Company shall have breached or

obligations under this Agreement, or any of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in
either case such that the events set forth in clauses (C)(2) or (C)(3) of
_Annex A_ shall have occurred, and have not been cured, prior to the later of
(A) any then scheduled expiration of the Offer or (B) 10 days after the giving
of written notice by Parent to the Company of such breach, violation or
inaccuracy; or

(e) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a
Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to enter into
a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law; (iii) the Company has notified Parent in writing of the
Superior Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal and a copy of the form of any related agreements (a
"Superior Proposal Notice") (it being understood that the Superior Proposal
Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so
deliver such notice, or update or amend public disclosures with respect
thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
purposes of this Agreement); (iv) if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement during the period beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Pacific Time on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of such Superior
Proposal Notice and ending three (3) Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. Pacific
Time; (v) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company during such three (3)
Business Day period a written proposal capable of being accepted by the
Company to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such three
(3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel),
after considering the terms of such proposal by Parent, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to such Superior Proposal Notice continues to be a
Superior Proposal; and (vi) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Termination Fee payable to Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)(ii)_; _provided_ that any material amendment or
modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new Superior
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 10.1(e)_ (and require a new (3)
Business Day period, measured as set forth above); or

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or (ii) the
Company shall have materially violated or breached any of its obligations and
agreements under _Section 6.2_ or  _Section 6.3_.

 



73 10.2 _Termination Before or After Appointment Time and Prior to Effective
Time_. Notwithstanding the prior adoption of this Agreement by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, this Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and/or the Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Effective Time (it being agreed that the party hereto terminating this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall give prompt written notice of
such termination to the other party or parties hereto), by either Parent or
the Company if any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
(a) enacted, issued or promulgated any Law that is in effect and has the
effect of making the consummation the Offer or the Merger illegal, or (b)
issued or granted any Order that is in effect and has the effect of making the
Offer or the Merger illegal, and such Order has become final and non-
appealable.

 

10.3 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.2_
shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or
_Section 10.2_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any director,
officer, employee, affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or
parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of _Section 8.8_, this _Section 10.3_, _Section 10.4_ and
_Article XI_, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement,
and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties hereto, as
applicable, from liability for any knowing and intentional breach of, or fraud
in connection with, this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, no
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations
shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

10.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 10.4_, all fees and

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent $100,000,000.00 (the "Termination Fee"),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days, in the event
that: (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to  _Section 10.1(b) _( _provided_ , that (x) each of the Antitrust
Condition, the Illegality Condition and the Government Litigation Condition is
satisfied at the time of such termination pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_
and (y) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)_
is then available to Parent) or (2) by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)_ (
_provided_ , that there shall not have occurred a breach, violation or
inaccuracy of the type that would entitle the Company to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_, without regard to the notice and
lapse of time requirements set forth therein); and (B) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the

 



74  termination of this Agreement under any of the circumstances described in
clause (A) above, an Acquisition Proposal that is an offer or proposal shall
have been publicly announced or shall have become publicly disclosed; and (C)
within three-hundred and sixty five (365) days following the termination of
this Agreement _under any of the circumstances_ described in clause (A) above,
the Company enters into a legally binding definitive agreement providing for,
or consummates, a Competing Acquisition Transaction (whether or not such
Competing Acquisition Transaction is with respect to the Acquisition Proposal
referenced in the preceding clause (B)). For purposes of the foregoing, a
"Competing Acquisition Transaction" shall have the same meaning as an
"Acquisition Transaction" except that all references therein to "more than
twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be references to "a majority," and
the reference therein to "eighty percent (80%)" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "fifty percent (50%)".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.1(f)_ (or by the Company pursuant to  _Section 10.1(b)_
following any time at which Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(f)_), the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business
Days.

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_, the receipt of such fee shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or
any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against the Company arising out of this Agreement (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

10.5  _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ ,
that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law without such approval.

 



75 10.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of such right.

the consideration pursuant to the Offer, as set forth in _Article II_, and
(c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive the
consideration pursuant to the Merger, as set forth in _Article III_. Parent
and Acquisition Sub hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys measure of damages for a willful and material
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub may include the loss of
the economic benefits of the transaction to Company Stockholders and other
relief (including equitable relief), whether or not this Agreement has been
validly terminated pursuant to _Article IX_.

11.6  _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 



78 11.7  _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and
the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such party (or parties) under this Agreement.

 

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

11.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with _Section 11.2_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, and nothing in this _Section 11.9_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable
Law; (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its
properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) in
the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court; (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought, tried and determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines
to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of

 



79  Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action
or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or
claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided

ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

11.11 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The parties hereto agree that
the disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set
forth in the corresponding section or subsection of this Agreement, and (ii)
any other representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the
Company that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause
(ii) only if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure.

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer
in the event that, at or prior to the expiration of the Offer: (A) any waiting

Governmental Authorities required by the Antitrust Laws of the United States
shall not have been obtained (the "Antitrust Condition"); (B) the Minimum

have occurred and continue to exist as of immediately prior to the expiration
of the Offer:

(1) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have (i)
enacted, issued or promulgated any Law that is in effect as of immediately
prior to the expiration of the Offer and has the effect of making the Offer or
the Merger illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise
preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or (ii) issued or
granted any Order that is in effect as of immediately prior to the expiration
of the Offer and has the effect of making the Offer or the Merger illegal or
which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation
of the Merger (the "Illegality Condition");

(2) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the Agreement (other than those set forth in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ ,
_4.4(a)_ , _4.6_ , _4.7(b)_ , _4.7(c)_ and _4.26(a)_ ) shall not be true and
correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement and immediately
prior to the expiration of the Offer with the same force and effect as if made
on and as of each such date (unless such representation or warranty expressly
relates to a specific date, in which case on and as of such specific date),
except for any failure to be so true and correct which has not had and would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(ii) any of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ ,
_4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4(a)_ and _4.26(a)_ shall not be true and correct in all

A-1   forth in _Sections_ _4.6_ , _4.7(b)_ and _4.7(c)_ shall not be true and
correct in all respects (other than (A) in the case of _Section 4.6_,
inaccuracies that would result in only a _de minimis_ increase in the
aggregate value of the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger, and
(B) in the case of _Sections 4.7(b)_ and _4.7(c)_ , inaccuracies that would
result in the aggregate in only an insignificant effect on Parents or the
Companys ownership or control of the Subsidiaries of the Company or on the
ability of Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company to own or
control their assets or conduct their respective businesses) as of the date
of this Agreement and immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer with
the same force and effect as if made on and as of each such date (unless such
representation or warranty expressly relates to a specific date, in which
case on and as of such specific date); _provided, however,_ that, for purposes
of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in the Agreement for purposes of clause (i) above, all
materiality and "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications set forth in
such representations and warranties shall be disregarded;

(3) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects the
obligations that are to be performed by it under the Agreement at or prior to
the expiration of the Offer;

the Company (i) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Acquisition Sub of
any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, seeking to restrain or prohibit the
making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (ii) seeking to impose
material limitations on the ability of Acquisition Sub, or render Acquisition
Sub unable, to accept for payment, pay for or purchase some or all of the
Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, (iii) seeking to impose
limitations on the ability of Acquisition Sub or Parent to exercise full
rights of ownership of the Company Shares, including, without limitation, the
right to vote the Shares purchased by it on all matters properly presented to
the Companys stockholders or (iv) which otherwise would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (the "Government Litigation
Condition"); or

 

(7) the Agreement shall have been properly and validly terminated in
accordance with its terms.
