identified on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto. The Real Property, together with (

 _ARTICLE II 
  
 PURCHASE PRICE_

 

2.1

 

 _Calculation of the Purchase Price_. In consideration of the covenants
herein contained, Entity Seller agrees to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser

purchase price equal to the sum of ( _i_ ) 85% of the Net Asset Value of the
Venture (as hereinafter defined) as of the Closing Date (as defined below),
plus ( _ii_ ) the DRA Pentagon Distribution. The price to be paid by
Purchaser to acquire the Seller Interest, subject to adjustment in accordance
with this Agreement, shall be referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_."

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Gross Asset Value_ " shall mean
the sum of Eight Hundred Five Million Dollars ($805,000,000), and the term "
_Net Asset Value of the Venture_ " shall mean the Gross Asset Value as
adjusted by the following adjustments calculated as of the Closing Date:

 

2.1.1

 

The Gross Asset Value shall be reduced by the outstanding principal balance of
( _i_ ) mortgage indebtedness secured by the Property as listed on _Exhibit B_

mezzanine indebtedness secured by interests in the Owners as listed on
_Exhibit B_ , and (iii) all other debt of the Venture and its direct and

The Entity Seller and Purchaser agree to allocate the Purchase Price to each
individual Property as shown on _Exhibit D_ attached hereto. The Purchase
Price allocations may not be recognized as measurements of value under
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other accounting
methodology. Entity Seller and Purchaser acknowledge that such allocations
were calculated in order to comply with state and/or local requirements
regarding transfer taxes and documentary stamps for the indirect transfer of
controlling interests in the Owners. Entity Seller and Purchaser further
acknowledge that the Purchase Price is based on the sale of retail shopping
centers comprising the Property as a package and not based on any values that
may have been assigned had the shopping centers comprising the Property been
sold in separate and distinct transactions to third party purchasers. 

 

2.2

 

 _Payment of the Purchase Price_. Entity Seller acknowledges that the
Purchase Price has been funded in part by the DRA Distribution prior to

the specific items set forth hereafter; it being understood that all
references to receipt of funds by Owner after Closing shall mean the receipt

any property management agreement or the Venture Agreement and which a DRA
Party did not have knowledge of or otherwise consent to prior to the Closing
Date, and Purchaser shall have no responsibility for an expense accrued prior

negligence, willful misconduct, or any action in violation of the Venture
Agreement by Entity Seller, Original DRA Member, DRA or any affiliate thereof
(individually, a " _DRA Party_ ", and collectively, the " _DRA Parties_ ")
prior to Closing that is binding on Purchaser post-Closing and which a Kimco
Party did not have knowledge of or otherwise consent to prior to the Closing
Date. 

 

6.1.2

 

 _Lease Rentals and Other Revenues_.

 

(i)

 

 _Rents_. At Closing, the Gross Asset Value shall be reduced by any rents

rent" which is addressed in _Section 6.1.2(ii)_ below) (collectively, "
_Tenant Payments_ "), if any, received by Owners under leases of space at the
Property (collectively, the " _Leases_ ") that relate to any period after the
Closing.

 

(ii)

 

 _Percentage Rent_. No adjustment shall be made to the Gross Asset Value at
Closing on account of percentage rents ( _i.e._ , that portion of the rent
payable to the landlord by a tenant under a Lease which is a percentage of the
amount of sales or of the dollar amount of sales). Any percentage rent with
respect to the calendar year (or other applicable fiscal year under a Lease
during which the Closing occurs for the measurement of percentage rents) in
which the Closing occurs which is received by any Owner after Closing and
which is attributable to the period prior to Closing shall result in and
require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section
6.1.17_. For purposes of prorating percentage rents, the amount
"attributable" to the period prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to (a)
the aggregate amount of such percentage rents actually collected for the
calendar year (or other applicable fiscal year under a Lease during which the
Closing occurs for the measurement of percentage rents) in which the Closing
occurs _multiplied_ _by_ (b) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of days prior to the Closing Date that the applicable tenant leases
space at the Property during the calendar year (or other applicable fiscal
year under a Lease during which the Closing occurs for the measurement of
percentage rents) in which the Closing occurs and the denominator of which
shall be the number of days that the applicable tenant leases space at the
Property during the calendar year (or other applicable fiscal year under a
Lease during which the Closing occurs for the measurement of percentage rents)
in which the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, percentage rents shall be prorated upon their collection in
accordance with this _Section 6.1.2(ii)_. This _Section 6.1.2(ii)_ shall
survive the Closing and not be merged therein. 

 

(iii)

 

 _Post-Closing Collections_. After Closing, Purchaser and the Venture shall
make a good faith effort to collect any Tenant Payments or other revenues not
collected as of the Closing Date on Owners behalf; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Purchaser and Venture shall not be required to cause any Owner to
institute any action or proceeding to collect any delinquent Tenant Payments
or other revenues not collected as of the Closing Date, and all Tenant
Payments or other revenues collected by Owners on or after the Closing Date
shall first be applied to all amounts due under the applicable Lease at the
time of collection ( _i.e._ , current Tenant Payments and sums due each

  Owner as the current owner and landlord) and the balance (if any) shall result
in and require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with
_Section 6.1.17_ , but only to the extent of amounts of Tenant Payments
delinquent and actually due such Owner from the same tenant which made the
post-Closing payment in question for the period prior to the Closing. For
purposes of prorating post-closing collections, the amount "attributable" to
the period prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to (a) the aggregate
amount of such rents actually collected for the calendar year (or other
applicable fiscal year under a Lease during which the Closing occurs for the
measurement of rents) in which the Closing occurs _multiplied_ _by_ (b) a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days prior to the
Closing Date that the applicable tenant leases space at the Property during
the calendar year (or other applicable fiscal year under a Lease during which
the Closing occurs for the measurement of rents) in which the Closing occurs
and the denominator of which shall be the number of days that the applicable
tenant leases space at the Property during the calendar year (or other
applicable fiscal year under a Lease during which the Closing occurs for the
measurement of rents) in which the Closing occurs. With respect to additional
rents, the parties shall exclude any additional rents from increased real
property taxes that for the Property to the extent such increase results
solely from the transactions contemplated herein. As soon as reasonably
possible after the end of the periodic period or calendar year, whichever
applicable, in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser shall cause each Owner to
do a reconciliation or true-up of all operating expenses and taxes owed by the
tenants for such year with any payments which have previously been made by the
tenants for such operating expenses and taxes. If the tenants are owed any
amounts of money as a result thereof, then such amounts shall result in and
require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section
6.1.17_ , and upon such Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation, Purchaser, on
behalf of Owner, shall distribute the owed amounts to tenants. If the tenants
owe any amounts of money as a result thereof, then, as and when such amounts
are collected from the tenants, such amounts shall result in and require a
Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section 6.1.17_.
The terms of this _Section 6.1.2(iii)_ shall survive the Closing and not be
merged therein.

 

6.1.3

 

 _Real Estate and Personal Property Taxes_. 

 

(i)

 

 _Ad Valorem Taxes_. _ _At Closing, the Gross Asset Value shall be increased
by all real property taxes and assessments paid, prior to or at Closing, by
the Owners relating to any period after the Closing and shall be reduced by
all unpaid real property taxes and assessments to the extent relating to any
period prior to the Closing, except to the extent payable directly by tenants.
The amount of any supplemental taxes, other than those payable directly by
tenants, assessed against the Property after Closing for the period prior to
the Closing Date (it being understood that Entity Seller shall have no
liability for assessments or an increase in taxes or supplemental taxes due
solely to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement) shall result in and
require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section
6.1.17_. The amount of any real property or personal property tax refunds and
credits received by the Owners after the Closing for the Property which are
attributable to a fiscal tax year prior to or in which the Closing occurred
and which are not refundable to the tenants shall result in and require a
Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section 6.1.17_.
Any such refunds and credits attributable to the fiscal tax year prior to or
during which the Closing occurs shall be apportioned after deducting the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of collection thereof. The adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 6.1.3(i)_ to be made post-closing with respect
to the Property shall also be made with respect to the Westbury Property, to
the extent applicable. The terms of this _Section 6.1.3(i)_ shall survive the
Closing and not be merged therein.

 

(ii)

 

 _Insufficient Information_. If, at Closing, the real estate and/or personal
property tax rate and assessments have not been set for the taxes due and
payable during the real estate tax year in which Closing occurs, then the
proration of such taxes shall be based upon the rate and assessments for the
preceding real estate tax year, and such proration shall be adjusted between
Entity Seller and Purchaser after Closing upon presentation of written
evidence that the actual taxes due and payable during the real estate tax year
in which Closing occurs differ from the amounts used at Closing and in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.1.17_. The adjustment
contemplated by this _Section 6.1.3(i)_ to be made post-closing with respect
to the Property shall also be made with respect to the Westbury Property, to
the extent applicable. The terms of this _Section 6.1.3(ii)_ shall survive
the Closing and not be merged therein.

 

6.1.4

 

 _Other Property Operating Expenses_. At Closing, the Gross Asset Value shall
be decreased by unpaid charges for water, sewer, electricity, gas, fuel and
other utility charges which relate to any period prior to the Closing, which
shall be estimated based on meter readings the day prior to the Closing or as
close thereto as possible. The Gross Asset Value shall also be reduced by any
accrued and unpaid periodic license or permit fees, any accrued and unpaid
payments due under any contracts binding on any Owner as of the Closing Date,
including, without limitation any reciprocal easement agreements
(collectively, the " _Contracts_ "), and any accrued and unpaid sales, use or
other taxes owed by Owners, and increased by any prepaid periodic license and
permit fees, any prepaid payments due under the Contracts and any prepaid
sales, use or other taxes owed by Owners.

6.1.5

 

 _Deposits_. The Gross Asset Value shall be deemed increased by an amount
equal to all refundable utility deposits and all refundable contract deposits
under the Contracts then held by third parties with respect to the Property,
and shall be deemed reduced by an amount equal to all cash security deposits
under the Leases (and to the extent not held by the Venture, shall be
delivered to the Venture). 

 

6.1.6

 

 _Existing Debt_. At Closing, the Gross Asset Value (i) shall be increased by
any interest under the Existing Debt which was prepaid for any period after
Closing and (ii) shall be decreased by any accrued but unpaid interest or
other amounts owed as of the Closing Date under the Existing Debt. At
Closing, the Gross Asset Value shall be increased by the amount of any
reserves and impound accounts (including, without limitation, accounts for
tenant improvements and leasing commissions) under the Existing Debt which are
being held by or on behalf of the Lenders under the Existing Debt as of the
Closing Date, which amounts are listed on the Closing Statement.

 

6.1.7

 

 _Cash_. At Closing, the Gross Asset Value shall be increased by the amount
of cash and cash equivalents (other than the DRA Distribution or any other
distributions made to Entity Seller or the Kimco Members in accordance with
the terms of the Venture Agreement) (" _Cash_ ") then held by the Owners,
Venture, Price Legacy, the Kimco Parties, Entity Seller, DRA (to the extent
relating to the Property and not distributed to the Kimco Members and Entity
Seller in accordance with the terms of the Venture Agreement) and their
affiliates (to the extent relating to the Property and not appropriately paid
to such affiliates for services rendered), as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any Cash which consists of (or arose from) condemnation awards
or insurance proceeds, as the case may be, resulting from any condemnation
proceeding or other similar taking with respect to the Property or any damage,
destruction or casualty with respect to the Property, shall not so increase
the amount of the Gross Asset Value.

 

6.1.8

 

 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges that all insurance policies currently in
place at the Property or relating to the Venture and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries will be cancelled as of the Closing Date. To the extent pre-paid
premiums for the foregoing policies are received after Closing, such receipt
shall require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with
_Section 6.1.17_. 

 

6.1.9

 

 _Maple Shade_. The Gross Asset Value shall be reduced as of Closing by any
unpaid rent and other sums due under the Lease dated October 6, 1989 between
Robert C. Baker, Loomis J. Grossman, and Richard A. Grossman, as landlord, and
The Price Company, as tenant (as amended and assigned, the " _Maple Shade

which relate to any period after Closing.

 

6.1.10

 

 _Remaining Bensalem Earn-Out_. The amount of the purchase price-earn out
that remains to be paid as of the Closing Date pursuant to that certain

Owner LLC and PL Bensalem LP, as seller, and Bensalem 11, LLC, as buyer ("
_Bensalem Buyer_ "), as amended by that certain Agreement #2 Regarding

Thousand Dollars ($930,000), subject to adjustment in accordance with the

and Entity Seller currently holds, a letter of credit in the original amount
of One Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,400,000) (the " _Bensalem
Earn-Out Letter of Credit_ "), which Bensalem Earn-out Letter of Credit has an
available balance to draw as of the Closing Date of One Million Four Hundred
Thousand Dollars $1,400,000. The Remaining Bensalem Earn-Out shall not be
adjusted until such amounts are collected by Purchaser or the applicable Owner
in accordance with the terms of the Bensalem Earn-Out Agreement. If at any
time after the Closing, Purchaser or the applicable Owner shall draw down on
the Bensalem Earn-Out Letter of Credit or receive payment of all or any
portion of the Remaining Bensalem Earn-Out, such drawn amount and/or payment
shall result in and require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in
accordance with _Section 6.1.17_. The terms of this _Section 6.1.10_ shall
survive the Closing and not be merged therein.

 

6.1.11

Linens and Things at the Property known as "Roseville", to the extent paid after
Closing, but on or prior to April 30, 2011, shall result in and require a
Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with _Section 6.1.17_.

 

6.1.13

 

 _Delayed Adjustment; Delivery of Operating and Other Financial Statements_.
All Prorations calculated pursuant to this _Article VI_ for the Closing have
been made on the basis of good faith estimates of Entity Seller and Purchaser
using currently available information. If at any time following the Closing
Date, the amount of an item listed in any section of this _Article VI_ shall
prove to be incorrect (whether as a result of an error in calculation or a
lack of complete and accurate information as of the Closing) or otherwise
require adjustment as a result of the Remaining Bensalem Earn-Out or any year-
end or periodic reconciliations or collections, including, without limitation,
with respect to delinquencies, reimbursable operating expenses or tax payments
by a tenant under a Lease, then, upon receipt of proof of such error or other
reason, provided that such proof is delivered to the party which was benefited
by such amount on or before December 31, 2011 (such period being referred to
herein as the " _Post Closing Adjustment Period_ "), the resulting amount
shall result in and require a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in
accordance with _Section 6.1.17_. Any party entitled to a Proration shall
only be entitled to its proportionate share of such Proration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Westbury Property, the
Post-Closing Adjustment Period for delinquencies, additional rent and
percentage rent shall be coterminous with the periods provided therefor in the
Westbury Purchase Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in the Venture Agreement or this Agreement, payment of the Purchase
Price as adjusted by the terms of this Agreement and any payments to Entity
Seller in connection with post-closing Prorations provided for under this
Agreement shall be in lieu of any further distributions to Entity Seller of
cash flow or any other amounts under the Venture Agreement, and Entity Seller
acknowledges and agrees that Entity Seller shall not be entitled to any
further distributions under the Venture to the extent accrued after the
Closing Date, and, to the extent accrued prior to the Closing Date, provided
such cash has been properly distributed to the date hereof either in
accordance with the Venture Agreement or _Section 6.1.7_ of this Agreement, as

Closing and not be merged therein.

 

6.1.14

 

 _Other Pre-Closing Expenses of the Owners_. To the extent that there are any
unpaid pre-Closing operating expenses of the Owners which have been actually
incurred by the Owners prior to Closing pursuant to a written agreement, then,
solely to the extent that a separate reduction of the Gross Asset Value or
Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation to reflect such operating expense has
not otherwise been made pursuant to this Agreement, the amount of such
operating expense shall result in and require a Post-Closing Prorations
Recalculation in accordance with _Section 6.1.17_.

 

6.1.15

 

  Other Pre-Closing Revenue of the Owners. To the extent that there is any
pre-Closing revenue generated that has accrued prior to Closing for which a
separate increase of the Gross Asset Value or Post-Closing Prorations
Recalculation to reflect such revenue has not otherwise been made pursuant to
this Agreement, the amount of such revenue shall result in and require a Post-
Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance with Section 6.1.17.  

 

6.1.16

 

 _Audit Rights_. Entity Seller and its representatives shall be afforded the
opportunity during normal business hours on business days upon three (3)
business days prior notice, and not more than two (2) times in any individual
Prorations Calculation Period, to review all underlying financial records
pertaining to any Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation, and Purchaser shall
promptly respond to Entity Sellers reasonable written inquiries for
information and shall permit Entity Seller and its representatives, to the
extent relevant to such Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation, to have full
access to the books and records in the possession of Purchaser, the Venture,
Price Legacy, the Kimco Parties and Owner or any party to whom Purchaser, the
Venture, Price Legacy, the Kimco Parties or Owner has given custody of the
same relating to the Property. Any Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation
prepared by Purchaser shall be final and binding for purposes of this
Agreement unless Entity Seller shall give written notice to Purchaser of
disagreement with the recalculation contained therein within thirty (30) days
following Entity Sellers receipt of such recalculation, specifying in
reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement. If Purchaser
and Entity Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to any
Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation within thirty (30) days following
receipt by Purchaser of the notice referred to above, the matters in dispute
shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if they are not available, any
of the other so-called "Big Four" accounting firms selected by Purchaser, for
final determination, with the costs of such accountant to be paid 50% by
Entity Seller and 50% by Purchaser, and the Post-Closing Adjustment Period
shall be deemed extended solely with respect to such matters in dispute.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
Section 10.1.4(c), the Purchaser shall have the right to settle all tenant
claims under the Leases for overcharges or landlord defaults without Entity

of the applicable Prorations made as of Closing, with amounts received from
and after Closing which are attributable to the period prior to Closing
allocated 85% to Entity Seller and 15% to Kimco Members, and with amounts owed
from and after Closing which are attributable to the period prior to Closing
allocated 85% to Entity Seller and 15% to Kimco Members. Purchasers
calculation of the Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation for any particular
Prorations Recalculation Period and supporting materials for that calculation
shall be provided to Entity Seller within thirty (30) days after the end of
that Prorations Recalculation Period. To the extent that either party hereto
is owed an amount on a net basis after the recalculation of each of the
applicable Prorations, including in such recalculation of the applicable
Prorations ( _i_ ) any and all such sums owed from any prior Prorations
Recalculation Periods that have not been paid, ( _ii_ ) any sums actually due
by the parties hereto under _Sections 6.2_ and _6.3_ that have accrued prior
to April 30, 2011, and ( _iii_ ) any sums actually due by the parties hereto
under _Article X_ that have accrued prior to April 30, 2011, then the party
owing such net amount shall pay such net amount to the party to which it is
owed prior to sixty (60) days after the end of the applicable Prorations
Recalculation Period (collectively, a " _Post-Closing Prorations
Recalculation_ "). Interest shall accrue on the net amount owed from and
after the end of said sixty (60) day period at 8% per annum until paid, except
to the extent such owed amount is disputed and determined by the accountant
provided for in _Section 6.1.16_ to be properly withheld. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.1.17_ , with respect to any Post-
Closing Prorations Recalculation occurring after April 30, 2011, if any or all
of such Post-Closing Prorations Recalculations result in a net balance owed to
Entity Seller, Purchaser shall be entitled to continue to hold such net
balance in an interest-bearing account as additional security for Entity
Sellers and DRAs obligations hereunder until such time that all Post-Closing
Prorations Recalculations have been completed and any claims under this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.2_ , _Section 6.3_ , and _Article X_ ,
to the extent actually made prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period, are finally resolved in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and, if the Purchaser is entitled to any sum with respect to the foregoing,
Purchaser may apply such amounts held against sums owed to Purchaser under the
terms of this Agreement, and Purchaser shall provide Entity Seller written
notice of such application. The provisions of this _Section 6.1.17_ shall
survive the Closing and not be merged therein. Entity Seller acknowledges and
agrees that it shall not be entitled to any income of the Venture, Price
Legacy, the Owners or the Property relating to the period after the Closing
except to the extent of a Post-Closing Prorations Recalculation in accordance
with this _Section 6.1.17_ and Kimco Parties acknowledge and agree that Entity
Seller shall not be responsible for any expense of a Kimco Party, the Venture,
Price Legacy, the Owners or the Property accruing in the period after Closing.

from the Lenders set forth on _Exhibit H_ to the sale of the Seller Interest
to the Purchaser, including consent charges, Lenders attorney fees and the
costs of any title insurance endorsements required by the Lenders in
connection therewith above $60,0000, provided, that, in no event shall Entity
Sellers portion of the Lender Costs exceed $6,500,000, in the aggregate ("
_Bucket 1_ "); provided, however, that Lender Costs shall not include costs
and expenses attributable to (a) an extension of the applicable loan, (b) an
amendment to the Existing Debt Documents which reflects economic or business
terms that are more favorable to a Kimco Party than those set forth in the
Existing Debt Documents; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the
right to amend the Existing Debt Documents to include a provision permitting
the liquidation of Price Legacy, except to the extent that there is a separate
charge attributable to the liquidation, or (c) any material benefit, economic
or otherwise, realized by a Kimco Party with respect to another property owned
by such party, ( _iii_ ) all of the New York Transfer Taxes and a $200,000

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and ( _iv_ )
Entity Sellers own attorneys fees _._ The provisions of this _Section 6.2_
shall survive the Closing and not be merged therein; provided  , that the
obligation of Entity Seller to pay the Lender Costs shall terminate on the
earliest to occur of (i) April 1, 2014, (ii) the sale of all of the Properties

10.1.1

 

(a)

 

85% of any and all losses, liabilities costs, damages and expenses resulting

covered by insurance before making a claim against DRA or Entity Seller.

satisfactory to Purchaser to secure DRAs post closing payment obligations to

delivery of the foregoing escrow instructions, the covenant contained in this

statements information to Purchaser shall be null and void and of no further
force or effect. To the extent that the Entity Seller is in violation of its
obligations under this _Section 10.1.5_ at any time and from time to time,

principal and non-default rate interest until such time that Entity Seller has

Loan Guarantor with respect to any indemnity contained herein to the extent
the losses, liabilities costs, damages or expenses or the conditions or
circumstances giving rise thereto were known to any of the DRA Knowledge
Parties, or caused by an act or omission of any DRA Parties, or for which
Entity Seller already received a credit pursuant to this Agreement. 

 



 

10.3

 

 _Indemnification Procedures_. Wherever in this _Article X_ an
indemnification (an " _Indemnification_ ") has been given by one party (the "
_Responsible Party_ ") to another (the " _Protected Party_ "), and there is a
dispute between the parties with respect to such Indemnification, then the
following shall apply; provided, however, that the following shall not apply
to any and all matters relating to Lender Consents, which shall in each case
be subject to Purchasers consent, in its sole discretion, and shall require
Entity Seller to expend sums in accordance with the terms of this Agreement up
to the aggregate amount of Bucket 1: If the Protected Party learns of any
event, occurrence or state of facts by which any Indemnification is likely to
apply, the Protected Party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the
Responsible Party and the Responsible Party shall have a commercially
reasonable opportunity and commercially reasonable period of time to take such
action (including legal action or defenses) as may be appropriate or necessary
to fulfill its obligations hereunder, and the Protected Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Responsible Partys investigation and defense of any claim
involved in the Indemnification, at no cost (other than de minimus) to the
Protected Party. The Responsible Party shall be entitled to control the
defense of any third party claim, including the selection of counsel (subject
to the Protected Partys reasonable approval), in each case at the Responsible
Partys expense. If a Responsible Party is not adequately or properly
defending the defense of any third party claim, as determined by the Protected
Party in its reasonable discretion, Protected Party may so defend with their
selected counsel at the expense of the Responsible Party with legal fees to be
paid by the Responsible Party on demand. The Protected Party shall not be
entitled to settle any such third party claim without the Responsible Partys
approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and the
Responsible Partys Indemnification obligation shall not apply to any
settlement consummated without the Responsible Partys consent, unless any
such settlement by the Protected Party is the result of the Responsible
Partys default of its obligations under this Section 10.3. If the Protected
Party at any time receives any payment under any insurance policy or from any
other source for any claim for which indemnity is sought hereunder, the amount
of coverage available to the Protected Party under such policy or other source
shall be deducted from the amount for which the Responsible Party is liable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing other than those matters relating to Lender
Consents, the Indemnification procedures set forth in this Section 10.3 shall
not apply to the expenditure of less than $200,000 in connection with any
individual Indemnification claim. The provisions of this Section 10.3 shall
survive Closing.
