commits to make U.S. Base Rate Loans to the Borrower in one or
two drawdowns during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on July 31, 2003, or as otherwise mutually agreed by
the parties hereto (the &quot;<u>Commitment</u>&quot;), in an
aggregate principal amount of the lesser of (i) U.S.$50,000,000,
and (ii) the aggregate amount of new employee loans made to

<p><b>2.2 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Requests for Borrowings</b></font><b>.</b>
To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Lender of
such request by telephone or by written Borrowing Request, not
later than 11:00 a.m., Toronto time, one Business Day before the
date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephone borrowing
request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by
hand delivery or telecopy to the Lender of a written Borrowing
Request signed by the Borrower by 12:00 noon on the date of such
telephone borrowing request. The Lender is entitled to rely upon
and act upon any telephone borrowing request or written Borrowing
Request given or purportedly given by the Borrower, and the
Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the authenticity and
validity of any such transaction once the Lender has advanced
funds based on such telephone borrowing request or written
Borrowing Request. Each such telephone borrowing request and
written Borrowing Request shall specify the following
information:</p>

<p><b>2.3 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Funding of Borrowings</b></font><b>.</b>
The Lender shall make each Loan to be made to the Borrower by
crediting, by 12:00 noon, Toronto time, the funds applicable to
each Borrowing Request, to an account of the Borrower maintained
with the Lender in Toronto and designated by the Borrower in such
Borrowing Request.</p>

<p><b>2.4 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Interest</b></font><b>.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Loans comprising each Borrowing shall bear interest
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
a year of 365 days or 366 days, as the case may be) at a rate per
annum equal to the U.S. Base Rate plus 2% per annum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear
interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum
equal to 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan.</p>

<p>(b) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date and,&nbsp;in the event of any
repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the
principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment. </p>

<p>(c) All interest hereunder shall be payable for the actual
number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day). The applicable U.S. Base Rate shall be determined by
the Lender, and such determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.</p>

<p>(d) For the purposes of the <i>Interest Act </i>(Canada) and
disclosure thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be
paid hereunder or in connection herewith is to be calculated on
the basis of a year of less than 365 days, or 366 days, as
applicable, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in
such calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by
the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same
is to be ascertained and divided by the number of days on which
the rate is calculated. The rates of interest under this
Agreement are nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields.
The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply
to any interest calculation under this Agreement.</p>

<p>(e) If any provision of this Agreement would oblige the
Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable
to the Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be
prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by that Lender of
&quot;interest&quot; at a &quot;criminal rate&quot; (as such
terms are construed under the <i>Criminal Code </i>(Canada)),
then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall
be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the
maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would
not be so prohibited by Law or so result in a receipt by that
Lender of &quot;interest&quot; at a &quot;criminal rate&quot;,
such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary (but only
to the extent necessary), by reducing any fees, commissions,
premiums and other amounts required to be paid to the Lender
which would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of
the <i>Criminal Code </i>(Canada).</p>

<p>(f) If any payment of interest is required to be made on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be payable on the
immediately preceding Business Day.</p>

<p><b>2.5 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Intentionally Deleted.</b></font><b>
</b></p>

<p><b>2.6 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Repayment of Loans</b></font><b>.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to
pay&nbsp;to the Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Loan on the Maturity Date together with all accrued interest, all
fees and other amounts outstanding hereunder.</p>

<p>(b) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Loans
shall be repaid (i) from the Closing Date until the second
drawdown, in monthly instalments equal to one sixtieth of the
amount of the first drawdown, payable on each Interest Payment
Date commencing on February 1, 2003, and (ii) from the date of
the second drawdown until the Maturity Date, in equal monthly
instalments payable on each Interest Payment Date, equal to the
total principal amount outstanding following the second drawdown,
divided by the number of Interest Payment Dates remaining up to,
and including, the Maturity Date.</p>

<p>(c) If any payment of principal is required to be made on a
day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be payable on
the immediately preceding Business Day.</p>

<p><b>2.7 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Evidence of Debt</b></font><b>.</b></p>

<p>(a) The Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of
the Borrower to the Lender resulting from each Loan made by the
Lender hereunder, including the amounts of principal and interest
payable and paid to the Lender from time to time hereunder.</p>

<p>(b) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
Section 2.7(a) shall be conclusive evidence (absent manifest
error) of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded
therein; <u>provided</u> that the failure of the Lender to
maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>2.8 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Prepayments</b></font><b>.</b></p>

<p>(a) <u>Mandatory Prepayments</u>. If the aggregate amount of
payments and forgiveness of Employee Notes for any month is in
excess of the instalment payment due in such month, the Borrower
shall immediately pay to the Lender the amount of such excess to
be applied&nbsp;as a prepayment of the Loans outstanding to
instalment payments required by Section 2.6(b) in inverse order
of maturity.</p>

<p>(b) <u>Voluntary Prepayments</u>. The Borrower may, at its
option, at any time and from time to time, prepay the Loans, in
whole or in part, without notice to the Lender with such
prepayment to be applied to instalment payments required by
Section 2.6(b) in inverse order of maturity.</p>

<p><b>2.9 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Increased Costs;
Illegality</b></font>.</p>

<p>(a) If any Change in Law shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, the Lender and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to the Lender of making or
maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make
any such Loan) or to increase the cost to the Lender of issuing
or maintaining any Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by the Lender hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to
the Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
the Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.</p>

<p>(b) A certificate of the Lender setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate the Lender as specified in
Section 2.9(a), together with a brief description of the Change
of Law, shall be delivered to the Borrower, and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the
Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within
ten&nbsp;days after receipt thereof.</p>

<p>(c) Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall not constitute a
waiver of the Lender&#146;s right to demand such compensation.</p>

<p><b>2.10 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Break Funding Payments</b></font>.
In the event of the failure by the Borrower to borrow or prepay
any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant hereto, the Borrower shall compensate the
Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.
A certificate of the Lender setting forth any amount or amounts
that the Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
2.10 shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay the Lender the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten&nbsp;days
after receipt thereof. </p>

<p><b>2.11 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Taxes</b></font>. </p>

<p>(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from
such payments, then (i)&nbsp;the sum payable shall be increased
as necessary so that, after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 2.11), the Lender receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deduction been made,
(ii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall make such deduction, and
(iii)&nbsp;the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law.</p>

<p>(b) In addition to the payments by the Borrower required by
Section 2.11(a), the Borrower shall pay any and all present or
future stamp or documentary Taxes or any other excise or property
Taxes, charges or similar levies arising from any payment made
hereunder or from the execution, delivery or enforcement of, or
otherwise with respect to, this Agreement to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.</p>

<p>(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Lender, within
ten&nbsp;days after written demand therefor, for the full amount
of any Indemnified Taxes paid by the Lender, on or with respect
to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.11) and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by the Lender
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.</p>

<p>(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Lender the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.</p>

<p><b>2.12 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Currency Indemnity</b></font>.
If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court in any
jurisdiction with respect to this Agreement or any other
Financing Document, it becomes necessary to convert into the
currency of such jurisdiction (the &quot;<u>Judgment Currency</u>&quot;)
any amount due under this Agreement or under any other Financing
Document in any currency other than the Judgment Currency (the
&quot;<u>Currency Due</u>&quot;), then conversion shall be made
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Business Day before the
day on which judgment is given. For this purpose &quot;rate of
exchange&quot; means the rate at which the Lender is able, on the
relevant date, to purchase the Currency Due with the Judgment
Currency in accordance with its normal practice at its head
office in Toronto, Ontario. In the event that there is a change
in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Business Day
before the day on which the judgment is given and the date of
receipt by the Lender of the amount due, the Borrower will, on
the date of receipt by the Lender, pay such additional amounts,
if any, or be entitled to receive reimbursement of such amount,
if any, as may be necessary to ensure that the amount received by
the Lender on such date is the amount in the Judgment Currency
which when converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
date of receipt by the Lender is the amount then due under this
Agreement or such other Financing Document in the Currency Due.
If the amount of the Currency Due which the Lender is so able to
purchase is less than the amount of the Currency Due originally
due to it, the Borrower shall indemnify and save the Lender
harmless from and against all loss or damage arising as a result
of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation
separate and independent from the other obligations contained in
this Agreement and the other Financing Documents, shall give rise
to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply
irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Lender from time to
time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an
amount due under this Agreement or any other Financing Document
or under any judgment or order.</p>

<p align="center"><b>ARTICLE 3</b><font color="#0000FF"><b><br>

Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on
its business as now and formerly conducted and is qualified to do
business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where
such qualification is required.</p>

<p><b>3.2 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Authorization;
Enforceability</b></font>. The Transactions are within the
Companies&#146; corporate powers and have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate and, if required, shareholder action.
This Agreement and the other Financing Documents have been duly
executed and delivered by the Companies (as applicable) and
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Companies
(as applicable), enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation,
moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors&#146; rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless
of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.</p>

<p><b>3.3 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Governmental Approvals; No
Conflicts</b></font>. The Transactions (a)&nbsp;do not require
any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any
other action by, any Governmental Authority, except as disclosed
in Schedule&nbsp;B, (b)&nbsp;will not violate any applicable Law
or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Companies or any order of any Governmental Authority,
(c)&nbsp;will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon the
Companies or their respective assets, or give rise to a right
thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Companies,
and (d)&nbsp;will not result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of the Companies, except for any Lien arising
in favour of the Lender under the Financing Documents.</p>

<p><b>3.4 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Financial Condition; No
Material Adverse Effect</b></font>.</p>

<p>(a) The Borrower has furnished to the Lender its consolidated
balance sheets and statements of income, retained earnings and
changes in financial position (i)&nbsp;as of and for the Fiscal
Year ended December 31, 2001, reported on by its auditors, and
(ii)&nbsp;as of and for the Fiscal Quarter and the portion of the
Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2002, certified by a Responsible
Officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position and
results of operations and cash flows of the Borrower as of such
dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to
year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the
case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.</p>

<p>(b) All information (including that disclosed in all financial
statements) pertaining to the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (the &quot;<u>Information</u>&quot;) that has been
or will be made available to the Lender by the Borrower or any
representative of the Borrower, taken as a whole, is or will be,
when furnished, complete and correct in all material respects and
does not or will not, when furnished, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which
such statements are made. The projections that have been or will
be made available to the Lender by the Borrower or any
representative of the Borrower have been or will be prepared in
good faith based upon reasonable assumptions. </p>

<p><b>3.5 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Litigation</b></font>. </p>

<p>(a) Except as disclosed in Schedule&nbsp;A, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings (including any Tax-related matter)
by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending
against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against
or affecting the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (i)&nbsp;as
to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters), or
(ii)&nbsp;that involve this Agreement, any other Financing
Document, or the Transactions.</p>

<p>(b) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change
in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the
likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

<p><b>3.6 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Compliance with Laws and
Agreements</b></font>. Each of the Companies is in compliance
with all Laws applicable to it or its property and all
indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Companies has violated or
failed to obtain any Authorization necessary to the ownership of
any of its property or assets or the conduct of its business,
which violation or failure could reasonably be expected to have
(in the event that such a violation or failure were asserted by
any Person through appropriate action) a Material Adverse Effect.</p>

<p><b>3.7 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Taxes</b></font>. The
Companies have timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns
and reports required to have been filed and have paid or caused
to be paid, or have adequately reserved for, all Taxes required
to have been paid by them (including all instalments with respect
to the current period) and have made adequate provision for Taxes

in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the
applicable Company has set aside on its books adequate reserves.</p>

Co., have title to their respective owned personal properties,
and with respect to leased personal properties, title to the
leasehold estate with respect thereto, pursuant to valid and
enforceable leases, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted

The Borrower has disclosed to the Lender all agreements,
instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which it or
any of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known
to it, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All
liabilities of the Borrower have been disclosed to the Lender in
writing.</p>

<p><b>3.10 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Defaults</b></font><b>.</b>
Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default nor has any
event or circumstance occurred which, but for the passage of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default (in
any respect that would have a Material Adverse Effect) under any
loan or credit agreement, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
security agreement or other instrument or agreement evidencing or
pertaining to any Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Subsidiary,
or under any material agreement or instrument to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Borrower or
any Subsidiary is bound, except as disclosed to the Lender in

does not own any Equity Securities or debt securities which are

casualty, flood, business interruption and other forms of
insurance owned or held by the Borrower and each of the
Subsidiaries provide adequate insurance coverage in at least such
amounts and against at least such risks (but including in any
event public liability) as are usually insured against in the
same general area by companies engaged in the same or a similar
business for the assets and operations of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary. All such material policies are in full force and
effect, all premiums with respect thereto have been paid in
accordance with their respective terms, and no notice of

</b>Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has withheld from
each payment to each of their respective officers, directors and
employees the amount of all Taxes, including income tax, pension

applicable Law. None of the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is
subject to any claim by or liability to any of their respective
officers, directors or employees for salary (including vacation
pay) or benefits which would rank in whole or in part <i>pari
passu</i> with or prior to the Liens created by the Security
Documents.</p>

<p><b>3.15 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Fiscal Year</b></font><b>.</b>
The Fiscal Year of the Borrower ends on December 31 of each
calendar year, and the Borrower&#146;s Fiscal Quarters end on the
last day of each of March, June, September and December of each

<p><b>3.16 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Intellectual Property
Rights</b></font>. The Borrower and each Subsidiary is the
registered and beneficial owner of, with good and marketable
title, free of all licenses, franchises and Liens to all patents,
patent applications, trade marks, trade mark applications, trade

any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
the Lender hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by
the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by Section 8.2(b), and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as
a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Lender may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.</p>

<p>(b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Financing Document
(or any provision hereof or thereof) may be waived, amended or
modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Lender.</p>

reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the
Lender and all applicable Taxes, in connection with the
preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents, (ii)&nbsp;all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Lender, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Lender and
applicable Taxes, in connection with any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or of any of
the other Financing Documents, (whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated), and
(iii)&nbsp;all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lender,
including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for
the Lender and all applicable Taxes, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in
connection with the Loans made hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring
or negotiations in respect of such Loans.</p>

Related Party of the Lender, (each such Person being called an
&quot;<u>Indemnitee</u>&quot;) against, and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, cost recovery actions,
damages, expenses and liabilities of whatsoever nature or kind
and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including due
diligence expenses, travel expenses and reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel) and all applicable Taxes to which
any Indemnitee may become subject arising out of or in connection
with (i)&nbsp;the execution or delivery of the Financing
Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby,
the performance by the parties thereto of their respective
obligations thereunder, and the consummation of the Transactions
or any other transactions thereunder, (ii)&nbsp;any Loan or any
actual or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom, or
(iii)&nbsp;any other aspect of this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents; <u>provided</u> that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence (it being acknowledged that ordinary negligence does
not necessarily constitute gross negligence) or wilful misconduct
of or material breach of this Agreement by such Indemnitee.</p>

<p>(c) The Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives (to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law), any claim against
any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct
or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, any Financing Document, or any agreement or instrument
contemplated thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of
the proceeds thereof.</p>

<p>(d) Any inspection of any property of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries made by or through the Lender is for purposes of
administration of the Credit only, and neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to rely upon the same
(whether or not such inspections are at the expense of the
Borrower).</p>

<p>(e) By accepting or approving anything required to be
observed, performed, fulfilled or given to the Lender pursuant to
the Financing Documents, the Lender shall not be deemed to have
warranted or represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness
or legal effect of the same, or of any term, provision or
condition thereof, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall
not constitute a warranty or representation to anyone with
respect thereto by the Lender. </p>

<p>(f) The relationship between the Borrower and the Lender is,
and shall at all times remain, solely that of borrower and
lender. The Lender shall not under any circumstance be construed
to be a partner or joint venturer of the Borrower or its
Affiliates. The Lender does not undertake or assume any
responsibility or duty to the Borrower or its Affiliates to
select, review, inspect, supervise, pass judgment upon or inform
the Borrower or its Affiliates of any matter in connection with
their property or the operations of the Borrower or its
Affiliates. The Borrower and its Affiliates shall rely entirely
upon their own judgment with respect to such matters, and any
review, inspection, supervision, exercise of judgment or supply
of information undertaken or assumed by the Lender in connection
with such matters is solely for the protection of the Lender, and
neither the Borrower nor any other Person is entitled to rely
thereon.</p>

<p>(g) The Lender shall not be responsible or liable to any
Person for any loss, damage, liability or claim of any kind
relating to injury or death to Persons or damage to Property
caused by the actions, inaction or negligence of the Borrower or
any Subsidiary and/or their Affiliates and the Borrower hereby
indemnifies and holds the Lender and the Lender harmless on the
terms set forth in Section 8.3(b) from any such loss, damage,
liability or claim.</p>

<p>(h) This Agreement is made for the purpose of defining and
setting forth certain obligations, rights and duties of the
Borrower and the Lender in connection with the Loans, and is made
for the sole benefit of the Borrower and the Lender. Except as
provided in Sections 8.3(b) and 8.4, no other Person shall have
any rights of any nature hereunder or by reason hereof.</p>

<p>(i) All amounts due under this Section 8.3 shall be payable
not later than ten&nbsp;Business Days after written demand
therefor.</p>

<p><b>8.4 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Successors and Assigns</b></font><b>.</b></p>

<p>(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither
party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
other party (and any attempted assignment or transfer by either
party without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in
this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the
extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the
Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>8.5 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Survival</b></font><b>.</b>
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by
the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the
time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued
interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under
this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the
Commitment has not expired or terminated. Sections 2.9, 2.10,
2.11 and 8.3 shall survive and remain in full force and effect,
regardless of the consummation of the Transactions, the repayment
of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitment or
the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.</p>

<p><b>8.6 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Counterparts; Integration;
Effectiveness</b></font><b>.</b> This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but
all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. This Agreement and the other Financing Documents
constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall become effective when
it shall have been executed by the Lender and when the Lender
shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken
together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties
hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Delivery of an executed original counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile shall be as
effective as delivery of a manually executed original counterpart
of this Agreement.</p>

<p><b>8.7 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Severability</b></font><b>.</b>
Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof, and the
invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction
shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.</p>

<p><b>8.8 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Right of Set Off</b></font><b>.</b>
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held
and other obligations at any time owing by the Lender or
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any of and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement held by the Lender,
irrespective of whether or not the Lender shall have made any
demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of the Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
set off) which the Lender may have.</p>

<p><b>8.9 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Governing Law;

governed by the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal

jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Ontario, and any
appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, or any other Financing Document
or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may
be heard and determined in Ontario. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the Lender
may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or any other Financing Document against the
Borrower or its properties in the courts of any other
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>(c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of

8.9(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any <i>forum non conveniens</i>
defence to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.</p>

<p>(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
8.1. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law.</p>

<p><b>8.10 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</b></font>.
EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER FINANCING DOCUMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO

SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)&nbsp;ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.</p>

<p><b>8.12 </b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Confidentiality</b></font><b>.</b>
The Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be
disclosed (a)&nbsp;to each of its Affiliates, directors,

Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the
confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep

by any regulatory authority or other Governmental Authority,
(c)&nbsp;to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations

agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those
of this Section, to any actual or prospective assignee of any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g)&nbsp;with the
consent of the Borrower, or (h)&nbsp;to the extent such
Information (i)&nbsp;becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section, or (ii)&nbsp;becomes
available to the Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, &quot;<u>Information</u>&quot;

the date hereof, such information is clearly identified as
confidential in writing at the time of delivery. Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as
