Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections with respect to the Closing Inventory Statement and any objections thereto (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). If the parties do not reach a final resolution within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of any objection statement, Seller and Buyer shall submit such dispute to an independent auditor. If any dispute is submitted to the independent auditor, each party will furnish to the independent auditor such work papers and other documents and information relating to the 

  ##### 

  

    

disputed issues as the independent auditor may request and are available to
that party. The independent auditor shall act as an auditor and not as
an arbitrator and shall resolve matters in dispute and adjust and establish
any disputed adjustment of the Purchase Price amount to reflect such
resolution. It is the intent of Buyer and Seller that the process set forth
in this Section 2.3(b) and the activities of the independent auditor
in connection herewith are not intended to be and, in fact, are not
arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules shall be followed (including
rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The determination of the
independent auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties
hereto. The Closing Inventory Statement shall be modified if necessary to
reflect such determination. The fees and expenses of the independent auditor
shall be allocated to Buyer and Seller equally. 

   

 (ii) If the Inventory Amount as finally determined is greater than Twenty-Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($27,500,000), Buyer shall make a cash payment to Seller in an amount equal to the amount of the excess over the Target Inventory Amount. If the Inventory Amount as finally determined is less than Twenty-Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($22,500,000), then Seller shall cause to be paid to Buyer a cash payment in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such shortfall from the Target Inventory Amount. The difference payable by either Buyer on the one hand or Seller on the other hand, shall be referred to herein as the " _Inventory Adjustment Amount_." The Inventory Adjustment Amount shall be paid by the applicable party within ten (10) days after such amount is finally determined hereunder and calculated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

 (c) _Contingent Payment_. 

  

 (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the Payment Amount; _provided_ , that in no event shall Buyer pay to Seller more than Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) pursuant to this  _Section 2.3(c)_ (the " _Contingent Payment_ "). 

   

 (ii) As promptly as possible, but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the end of the Measurement Period, Buyer will deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Contingent Payment Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers calculation of the Contingent Payment and reasonably supporting data for the calculation thereof. 

   

 (iii) After delivery of the Contingent Payment Statement, Seller shall be permitted reasonable access to review Buyers records used to prepare the Contingent Payment Statement. If Seller objects to the Contingent Payment Statement, then Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth in writing its objections within fifteen (15) Business Days following its receipt of the Contingent Payment Statement. If Seller does not deliver such a statement within fifteen (15) Business Days after delivery of the Contingent Payment Statement, the Contingent Payment Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve Sellers objections with respect to the Contingent Payment Statement (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state rule)). If the 

  ##### 

  

    

parties do not reach a final resolution within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the delivery of any objection statement, Seller and Buyer shall submit
such dispute to an independent auditor to review the Contingent Payment
Statement. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with the independent auditor, and
Buyer shall provide the independent auditor access to such books and records
of Buyer relating to the Measurement Amount used to calculate the Contingent
Payment as may be reasonably necessary to permit a determination by the
independent auditor of the accuracy of the Contingent Payment.
The independent auditor shall act as an auditor and not as an arbitrator and
shall resolve matters in dispute and adjust and establish the disputed
Contingent Payment to reflect such resolution in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.3(c)_ and deliver a report of
its determination to Seller and Buyer (the " _Auditor Contingent Payment
Report_ "). The Auditor Contingent Payment Report shall be final and binding
on Seller and Buyer. The fees and expenses of the independent auditor shall
be allocated to Buyer and Seller equally. 

   

 (iv) Buyer shall, within ten (10) days after such amount is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3 (c), make a cash payment to Seller in the amount of any Contingent Payment due hereunder and calculated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

   

 (v) During the Measurement Period, Buyer shall operate the Mobility Business relating to the Measurement Amount in the ordinary course of its business and in compliance with the policies set forth on _Schedule 1.1(c)_.

 (d) will not permit the lapse of any right relating to the Assigned Intellectual Property, including not taking any action to abandon, disclose, misuse, misappropriate, the Assigned Intellectual Property in any manner (other than licenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices) or assert or threaten any claims with respect to the Assigned Intellectual Property; 

  

 (e) will not sell, lease, license, transfer or dispose of any asset that would otherwise be a Purchased Asset, other than sales of Inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and Section 5.2(d);

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph is intended to modify or adjust the substantive liability of Buyer and Seller under this Agreement with respect to the Taxes described in this paragraph. 

  

 (b) Seller and Buyer recognize their mutual obligations pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code to timely file IRS Form 8594 (the " _Asset Acquisition Statement_ ") with their respective federal income tax returns.

If Seller and Buyer shall have agreed on a Purchase Price allocation and an Asset Acquisition Statement, then Seller and Buyer shall file the Asset Acquisition 

   ##### 

  

    

Statement in the form so agreed and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take a Tax
position which is inconsistent with such Purchase Price allocation, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. 

  

 5.4 Business Employees 

  

 (a) As of the Closing Date, notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall make offers of employment to, or otherwise employ by operation of law, the Business Employees listed on _Schedule 3.10(a)_ (including those absent due to vacation, holiday, illness, leave of absence or short-term disability, but excluding any Business Employee on long-term disability). Seller and any applicable Subsidiary shall cooperate and assist in facilitating Buyers or a Buyer Designees offers and will not take any action, or cause any of the Subsidiaries to take any action, which would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with Buyers or a Buyer Designees effort to hire any Business Employees. Promptly after the date hereof, Seller will provide to Buyer all information not provided in _Schedule 3.10(a)_ required to be disclosed by applicable Law of the jurisdiction in which the Business Employee is located in connection with the sale of the Mobility Business. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party shall comply with all applicable Laws in connection with the transfer of the Business Employees to Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including with respect to notice, consultation and other procedural requirements. The parties will enter into an Assignment and Bill of Sale and Assumption Agreement for relevant jurisdictions outside the United States where necessary or appropriate for the transfer of such Business Employees and shall cooperate to complete all requisite consultation and related objection periods prior to the Closing Date. Business Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment or otherwise transfer to Buyer or a Buyer Designee by operation of Law, as of the effective date of their employment with Buyer, shall be referred to as " _Transferred Employees_." Employment with Buyer or a Buyer Designee of Transferred Employees shall be effective as of the day following the close of business on the Closing Date, except that the employment of individuals receiving short-term disability benefits or on approved leave of absence on the Closing Date will become effective as of the date they present themselves for work with Buyer or a Buyer Designee or such other date as is prescribed by applicable Law. 

  

 (b) Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee will comply with applicable Law regarding terms of employment of Transferred Employees. Where terms are not dictated by applicable Law, Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Transferred Employees, until at least December 31, 2008 during their employment with Buyer or a Buyer Designee, the same base salary offered by Seller or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date as set forth on _Schedule 3.10(a)_. Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to Transferred Employees employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee; provided, that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide compensation in the form of equity incentives to the Transferred Employees. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4, no assets of any Benefit Plan shall be transferred to Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer. Each employee Benefit Plan, program, policy and arrangement of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer, Welfare Plans, 

   ##### 

  

    

vacation plans and severance plans, shall recognize to the extent permitted by
Buyers or a Buyer Designees plans and to the extent that it is
administratively feasible to do so (i) for purposes of satisfying any
deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums during the coverage period
that includes the Closing Date, any payment made by any Transferred Employee
towards deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums in any health or
other insurance plan of Seller or a Subsidiary and (ii) for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and for any schedule
of benefits based on service, all service with Seller or a Subsidiary,
including service with predecessor employers that was recognized by Seller or
a Subsidiary, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer or
the applicable Buyer Designee will continue to provide (x) relocation
assistance to those Transferred Employees receiving it as of the Closing Date
and (y) tuition assistance to those Transferred Employees who are receiving
such benefits as of the Closing Date for the current academic session, in
each case as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_. Buyer or the applicable Buyer
Designee will honor the terms and conditions of Sellers international
assignee program, including repatriation upon completion of assignment,
completion bonuses, Tax equalization and Tax return preparation, with respect
to Transferred Employees who are on international assignment as of the
Closing Date, in each case as set forth on _Schedule 5.4(b)_, except that
these costs shall be allocated between the parties based on the portion of
the international assignment occurring before or on the Closing Date (which
shall be Sellers or the applicable Subsidiarys obligation) and after the
Closing Date (which shall be Buyers or the applicable Buyer
Designees obligation). For sake of clarification, except where required by
applicable Law and subject to appropriate arrangements between Buyer and
Seller with respect to the liabilities associated with respect to such plans,
including the transfer of any funds associated therewith, Buyer is
not assuming any Pension Plan liabilities or offering any Pension Plan
benefits. 

  

 (c) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a severance of employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and that such employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall provide severance benefits substantially equivalent to the benefits listed on _Schedule 5.4(c)_ to Transferred Employees whose employment is terminated involuntarily by Buyer on or before December 31, 2008 other than terminations in circumstances that would not require payments of severance benefits under Sellers severance plan. 

  

 (d) Buyer agrees that its and its Affiliates health and Welfare Plans shall waive any pre-existing condition exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was waived under applicable health and Welfare Plans offered to the Transferred Employees by Seller or a Subsidiary) and any proof of insurability. Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall remain responsible for any benefits payable under a Benefit Plan with respect to claims incurred by Business Employees prior to or on the Closing Date. 

  

 (e) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause one or more defined contribution savings plans intended to qualify under sections 401(a) and 

   ##### 

  

    

401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") to provide for the receipt
of Transferred Employees lump sum cash distributions, in the form of an
eligible rollover distribution from the Agere Systems Inc. Management 401(k)
Plan, provided such rollovers are made at the election of the
Transferred Employees and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Savings
Plan. Seller shall cause the Agere Systems Inc. Management 401(k) Plan to
permit the Transferred Employees to elect a lump sum cash distribution of
benefits accrued through the Closing Date in accordance with the Code. 

  

 (f) Seller shall make and be responsible for incentive compensation payments, if any, to Transferred Employees for the period from October 1, 2006 to and including the Closing Date in accordance with its short-term incentive plan in effect for any such period. 

  

 (g) The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to determine whether any notification may be required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ ") as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will be responsible for providing any notification that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to any of its employees. Buyer will be responsible for providing any notification that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to any Transferred Employees terminated after the Closing Date. 

  

 (h) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or a Buyer Designee to employ any Business Employees, to employ any Transferred Employee on anything other than an at-will basis, terminable at any time with or without cause, or to assume any collective bargaining agreements under this Agreement. 

  

 (i) This Section 5.4 specifies the full extent of Buyers obligation with respect to the Transferred Employees after the Closing Date, except as may be required by applicable Law. 

  

 5.5 Collateral Agreements; Leased Equipment

 (b) Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall provide Buyer with the costs and other terms applicable to the Leased Equipment and Buyer shall decide whether such Leased Equipment will (a) transfer to Buyer or a Buyer Designee as of the Closing Date by Buyer or a Buyer Designee assuming the leases for such equipment, (b) become the property of Buyer or a Buyer Designee as of the Closing Date by Buyer or a Buyer Designee paying for the costs of purchasing such equipment pursuant to the leases (the " _Purchased Leased_  

   ##### 

  

    

 _Equipment_ "), or (c) remain the property of Seller or a Subsidiary as of
the Closing Date (the " _Excluded Leased Equipment_ "). 

  

 (c) Promptly after the date hereof, Buyer shall identify the Leases that Buyer elects to be assumed pursuant to a Lease Assignment rather than subleased pursuant to a Sublease and the parties will revise Schedule 3.7 to reflect the same. 

  

 5.6 Regulatory Compliance; Post-Closing Cooperation 

  

 (a) Subject to Section 5.6(b), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable commercial efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Bodies and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Bodies, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any Governmental Body, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties including all Required Consents, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Body vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements.

Seller and Buyer agree that their respective initial filings under the HSR Act and in respect of any foreign antitrust approval shall be made no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the date of this Agreement. Each party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any U.S. federal or state or foreign or multinational governmental agency, including any filings necessary under the provisions of the HSR Act. Each party shall provide the other party the opportunity to make copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between such party or its representatives, on the one hand, and the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States 

   ##### 

  

    

Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") or any state, foreign or
multinational Governmental Body or members of their respective staffs, on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party agrees to inform promptly the other party of any
communication made by or on behalf of such party to, or received by or on
behalf of such party from, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
state, foreign or multinational Governmental Body regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (c) Buyer acknowledges that Seller is defending a legal proceeding as described in  _Schedule 3.9_ relating to the Mobility Business (the " _Retained Legal Proceeding_ "), and that Seller is retaining all liability and responsibility for, and control of, the Retained Legal Proceeding following the Closing Date. In connection with such proceeding, Buyer agrees (i) to use its reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate fully in the discovery and defense by Seller of the Retained Legal Proceeding by affording Seller and its representatives full and complete access to documents (as defined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) and the Transferred Employees and (ii) to take such other actions reasonably requested by Seller (for which Seller does not have reasonably equivalent alternative) relating to the Purchased Assets and the Transferred Employees not determined by Buyer in its good faith judgment to materially and adversely impact Buyer. 

  

 5.7 Contacts with Suppliers and Customers; Transfer of Information 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, without the prior consent of Seller, Buyer shall not contact any suppliers to, or customers of, the Mobility Business in connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements other than in the course of the conduct of Buyers businesses responding to customer inquiries by providing information about the subject matter of the Agreement or the Collateral Agreements previously approved by Seller. In contemplation of the Closing, Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate to prepare a communications plan for business partners of the Mobility Products Group, and in contacting any suppliers to, or customers of, the Mobility Business in connection with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement or the Collateral Agreements and to facilitate the transition of the Mobility Business, including the preparation of letters to all customers, suppliers, distributors and other business partners of the Mobility Business to notify them of the Closing and provide information regarding the transition of the Mobility Business to Buyer.

 5.8 Use of the Seller Name 

  

 (a) Buyer and Seller agree as follows: 

  

 (i) Except as provided below, immediately after the Closing Date, Buyer and any Buyer Designee shall cease using "Agere," "Agere Systems _,_ " "LSI," or "LSI __ Corporation") or other similar mark (the " _LSI Name_ ") and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) in all invoices, letterhead, advertising and promotional materials, office forms or business cards; 

   

 (ii) Except as provided below, within three (3) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (A) remove any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates from all buildings, signs and vehicles of the Mobility Business; and (B) cease using the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) in electronic databases, web sites, product instructions, packaging (except as provided below) and other materials, printed or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Buyer Designees shall not be restricted in using any packaging materials that are in inventory as of the Closing Date; 

   

 (iii) Buyer and Buyer Designees shall not be required at any time to remove the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates from inventory of the Mobility Business that is in existence as of the Closing Date, nor shall Buyer nor Buyer Designees be required at any time to remove such Seller Name and any such other trademark, design or logo from schematics, plans, manuals, drawings, machinery, tooling including hand tools, and the like of the Mobility Business in existence as of the Closing Date to the extent that such instrumentalities are used in the ordinary internal conduct of the Mobility Business and are neither generally observed by the public nor intended for use as means to effectuate or enhance sales; 

   

 (iv) Notwithstanding the above, Buyer and Buyer Designees shall have the right to sell existing inventory and to use existing packaging, labeling, containers, supplies, advertising materials, technical data sheets and any similar materials bearing the Seller Name or any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates until the earlier of (A) one year after the Closing Date or (B) the depletion of existing inventory; 

   

 (v) Buyer and Buyer Designees shall use Reasonable Efforts (as defined below) to remove the Seller Name and any other trademark, design or logo previously or currently used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than those that are transferred pursuant to the Intellectual Property Agreement) from those assets of the Mobility Business (such as, but not limited to, tools, molds, and machines) used in association with the products of the Mobility Business or otherwise reasonably used in the conduct of the Mobility Business   ##### 

  

  

  

after the Closing. For the purposes of this Section 5.8(a)(v), " _Reasonable
Efforts_ " means Buyer and Buyer Designees shall remove the Seller Name from
such assets but only at such time when such asset is not operated or
otherwise is taken out of service in the normal course of business due to
regular maintenance or repair (but only for such repairs or maintenance where
such removal could normally be undertaken, for example, repair or maintenance
of a mold cavity) whichever occurs first; provided that, in no event
shall Buyer or any Buyer Designee use the Seller Name after the date which is
one (1) year from the Closing Date. Buyer and Buyer Designees shall not be
required to perform such removal on such assets that are not or are no longer
used to manufacture the products of the Mobility Business or other parts, or
if discontinuance of use of such assets is reasonably anticipated during such
time period, or from assets stored during that period provided that such
marks are removed upon such assets return to service or prior to their sale
or other disposition. 

   

 (vi) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and Buyer Designees a limited right to use the Seller Name and associated trademarks, designs and logos as specified in, and during the periods, if any, specified in clauses (i)  (v) above.

 (b) In no event shall Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer advertise or hold itself out as LSI or Agere or an Affiliate of Agere or LSI after the Closing Date. 

  

 5.9 Non-Solicitation or Hiring of Transferred Employees 

  

 None of Seller, any of its representatives or any of its Affiliates will at any time prior to the date which is one year after the date hereof, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of or hire any Transferred Employee without Buyers prior written consent. The term " _solicit the employment_ " shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees through media advertisements, employment firms or otherwise that are not focused on or directed to Transferred Employees. This restriction shall not apply to any employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than for cause by Buyer, or its successors, after the Closing. 

  

 5.10 No Negotiation or Solicitation 

  

 Prior to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates will not (and Seller will take all action necessary to cause each of its employees, officers, representatives and agents or advisors not to and shall cause its Affiliates to cause employees, officers, representatives and agents or advisors not to) directly or indirectly (a) solicit, initiate, entertain, encourage or accept the submission of any proposal, offer or any discussions relating to or that might reasonably be expected to lead to or result in any proposal or offer from any Person relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of the Mobility Business or any portion of the Purchased Assets (other than purchases of Products or services from the Mobility Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations 

   ##### 

  

    

regarding the Mobility Business, furnish any information with respect
thereto, or assist or participate in, or facilitate or encourage in any other
manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing. Seller will notify Buyer if any Person makes any proposal,
offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing within one (1)
Business Day after receipt of any such offer or proposal, including the
identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or contact
and all material terms thereof. 

  

 5.11 Non-Competition 

  

 (a) Seller agrees that, as part of the consideration for the payment of the Purchase Price, for a period of two (2) years immediately following the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, as a principal, stockholder, joint venturer, or otherwise, operate, perform or have any ownership interest in any business that engages in research and design, develops, manufactures, sells, installs or distributes products in competition with the Mobility Business, except that Seller may (i) purchase or otherwise acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock, controlling interest or otherwise any Person or business or engage in any similar merger and acquisition activity with any Person the primary business of which is not in competition with the Mobility Business, or (ii) invest as a minority shareholder in any Person. For the purposes of this Section 5.11(a), ownership of securities of a company whose securities are publicly traded under a recognized securities exchange not in excess of 10% of any class of such securities shall not be considered to be competition with the Mobility Business, and a Person shall not be considered to be in the " _primary business_ " of competing with the Mobility Business if such Person derives less than 20% of its revenues, up to a maximum aggregate amount of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000), from products that compete with the Mobility Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the agreements and limitations set forth in this Section 5.11 shall not apply to any entity that acquires all or part of Seller in any transaction. 

  

 (b) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.11(a) constitute a material inducement to Buyers entering into and performing this Agreement. Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach of such obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to Buyer for which there may be no adequate remedy at Law and further agrees that in the event of any breach of said obligation, Buyer may be entitled to injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the circumstances. 

  

 (c) If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section 5.11, but this Section 5.11 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent 

   ##### 

  

    

jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.11 to
provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time
period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as
shall be valid and enforceable under such applicable Law. 

  

 5.12 Post Closing Remittances 

  

 If on or after the Closing Date, either Party receives a payment from a Third Party (including a customer of the Business) that, pursuant to the terms hereof, should have been paid to the other Party, the Party who receives the payment agrees to hold in trust and remit such payment to the Party entitled thereto within five (5) Business Days of such receipt. 

  

 5.13 Prorations and Adjustments 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all ordinary course expenses for (i) rents and other charges or amounts payable included in the Purchased Assets and transferred to Buyer hereunder and (ii) gas, electricity, water, sewer, rent and telephone charges at the Leased Premises, in each case, for the period prior to the Closing Date, will be for the account of Seller and for the period on and after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Buyer. If any Party actually makes any payments that are, in whole or in part, designated as payments for the period allocated to the other Party under this Section 5.13, such other Party shall promptly reimburse such amounts to the Party so making such payments.

therein was derived from the books and records of Seller, (ii) the revenues
of the Mobility Business reflected therein are presented on a basis
consistent with GAAP and Sellers standard accounting policies and
procedures, and (iii) the costs reflected therein constitute the costs of
Seller directly involved in and specifically identifiable to the revenue
producing activity of the Mobility Business, as determined in the reasonable
judgment of Seller and, as applicable, based on the allocation
methodologies referenced in the notes to the Financial Information. Seller

Such abbreviated financial statements and such other information required by the SEC in response to the waiver letter are referred to herein as the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ". Seller shall as promptly as practicable (i) retain its independent auditors to provide to Buyer the Audited Financial Statements, and (ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause such auditors to consent to the inclusion of such financial statements in the Buyers filings with the SEC, including on Form 8-K, Form 20-F (or any amendments thereto) or such other form reasonably determined by Buyer, including by providing such auditors with a reasonable and customary representation letter in connection therewith. In the event that Buyer is required to comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, Seller will use its reasonable commercial efforts to assist Buyer and provide such financial information related to the Mobility Business as Buyer reasonably deems to be necessary to enable Buyer to comply with such regulation.

 5.16 Updates 

  

 From time to time prior to the Closing Date, Seller will promptly notify Buyer of any fact, circumstance, change or effect arising that could reasonable be expected to constitute a material breach of a representation or warranty of Seller hereunder or would constitute a Seller Material Adverse Effect, or any action, claim, suit or investigation threatened against a party or the parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller (or any of its Affiliates) is in the opinion of Sellers counsel compelled to disclose the Proprietary Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, Seller (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the Proprietary Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required by Law.

   ##### 

  

    

party contained in this Agreement to have been true when made and at and as

 (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and any Buyer Indemnified Party from and against any Losses incurred by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) the Excluded Liabilities and any failure of Seller to discharge any of the Excluded Liabilities; and (ii) Buyers waiver of any applicable Bulk Sales Laws.

 (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss of revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, _provided_ ,  _however_ , the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims (including, if applicable, punitive damages).

 (j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Article 9 shall not limit the indemnification obligations of an Indemnifying Party with respect to fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

  

 9.3 General Procedures for Indemnification 

  

 (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any audit or investigation of a Governmental Body, action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any claim, action, suit or proceeding (including an audit or investigation of a Governmental Body) by a Third Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), to assume the defense and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim that (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages, or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted by the Third 

   ##### 

  

    

Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the claims for
money damages. If the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing its
obligation to indemnify in full the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense or the
settlement against such Third Party Claim. In the event that any party
exercises its right to undertake any such defense against any Third Party
Claim as provided above, then the other parties shall cooperate in such
defense and make available at such cooperating party expense all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in such partys possession and
control relating thereto as is reasonably required to by the party conducting
the defense. 

  

 (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in this Agreement. 

  

 (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary damages which are indemnified Losses the Indemnifying Party will fully satisfy. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such Third Party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 9.4 for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses relating thereto (including the costs of defense thereof) with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 (d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim shall be incurred. Such notice shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such a claim as provided in Section 9.4(a). The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.3, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to 

   ##### 

  

    

contest the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss or the basis of
a claim for a Loss in an amount that is not yet known by stating with
particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount
thereof. 

  

10\. Miscellaneous Provisions 

   

 10.1 Notices 

  

 All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt if (i) mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, (ii) sent by Federal Express or other express carrier, fee prepaid, (iii) sent via facsimile with receipt confirmed, or (iv) delivered personally, addressed as follows or to such other address or addresses of which the respective party shall have notified the other.

 10.2 Expenses 

  

 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party to this Agreement will bear all the fees, costs and expenses that are incurred by it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such transactions are consummated. 

  

 10.3 Entire Agreement; Modification 

  

 The agreement of the parties, which consists of this Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents referred to herein, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding, written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby, and in accordance with Sections 11.3 and 11.4. 

  

 10.4 Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability 

  

 This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the other partys written consent; provided, that Buyer may transfer or assign in whole or in part to one or more Buyer Designee its right to purchase all or a portion of the Purchased Assets, but no such transfer or assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns of each party hereto. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more provisions are deemed illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect unless the deletion of such provision shall cause this Agreement to become materially adverse to either party, in which event the parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to arrive at an accommodation that best preserves for the parties the benefits and obligations of the offending provision. 

  

 10.5 Governing Law 

  

 THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN THAT STATE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHOICE OF LAWS PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING MATTERS OF VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT, ENFORCEABILITY, PERFORMANCE AND REMEDIES. 

  

 10.6 Consent to Jurisdiction 

  

 Each of Buyer and Seller irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (ii) the United States 

   ##### 

  

    

District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the purposes of any
suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no such action, suit or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby
shall be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such courts). Buyer
further agrees, and Seller further agrees, that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Persons
respective address set forth in Section 10.1 above shall be effective service
of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of Buyer and Seller irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York or that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. 

  

 10.7 Waiver of Jury Trial 

  

 Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party (i) certifies that no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.7. 

  

 10.8 Execution in Counterparts 

  

 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 10.9 Public Announcement 

  

 Prior to the signing of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall prepare a mutually agreeable release announcing the transaction contemplated hereby. Except for such press release, neither Seller nor Buyer shall, without the approval of the other, make any press release or other announcement concerning the existence of this Agreement or the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so obligated by Law, in which case the other party shall be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to comply with accounting, stock exchange or federal securities or labor relations Law disclosure obligations. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries 

  

 Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall (a) confer on any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors or assigns any rights (including Third-Party beneficiary rights), remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or (b) constitute the parties hereto as partners or as participants in a joint venture. This Agreement shall not provide Third Parties with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to the terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving to any Business Employee, or any other individual, any right or entitlement to employment or continued employment or any right or entitlement under any Benefit Plan, policy or procedure maintained by Seller, except as expressly provided in such Benefit Plan, policy or procedure.

11\. Termination and Waiver 

   

 11.1 Termination 

  

 This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date by: 

  

 (a) _Mutual Consent_. The mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; 

  

 (b) _Failure of Buyer Condition_. Buyer upon written notice to Seller if any of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment by the Termination Date and shall not have been waived in writing by Buyer;

 (e) _Delay_. Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred by January 15, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ "); 

   #####

 11.2 Effect of Termination 

  

 In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 11.1, this Agreement shall become void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or stockholders, except for the obligations of the parties hereto as provided in Article 6 relating to the obligations of Buyer and Seller to keep confidential certain information, Section 10.2 relating to certain expenses, Section 10.9 relating to publicity and this Section 11.2. Nothing in this Section 11.2 shall be deemed to release either party from any liability for any willful and material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder. 

  

 11.3 Waiver of Agreement 

  

 Any term or condition hereof may be waived and at any time prior to the Closing Date by the party hereto which is entitled to the benefits thereof by action taken by its Board of Directors or its duly authorized officer or employee, whether before or after the action of such party; provided, however, that such action shall be evidenced by a written instrument duly executed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer or employee. The failure of either party to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

  

 11.4 Amendment of Agreement 

  

 This Agreement may be amended with respect to any provision contained herein at any time prior to the Closing Date by action of the parties hereto taken by their Boards of Directors or by their duly authorized officers or employees, whether before or after such partys action; provided, however, that such amendment shall be evidenced by a written instrument duly executed on behalf of each party by its duly authorized officer or employee. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be duly executed on its behalf by its duly authorized officer as of the date first written above.
