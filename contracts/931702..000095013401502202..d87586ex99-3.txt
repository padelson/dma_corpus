         Affiliated PC as an orthodontist or pedodontist, as applicable, for a

         (A) an agreement by such OrthAlliance Affiliated Practice Owner and
         OrthAlliance Affiliated PC to continue the employment of such

         OrthAlliance Affiliated PC to utilize only OCA's and its Subsidiaries'
         proprietary computer software and operating systems in connection with

         business functions of such OrthAlliance Affiliated Practice, and to
         maintain the current status of such OrthAlliance Affiliated Practice's
         advertising or non-advertising, as the case may be, to the general
         public, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between OCA or its
         Subsidiary and such OrthAlliance Affiliated PC.

         (c) At the Effective Time, each certificate (each, a "Certificate")
previously representing any such shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock shall
thereafter only represent the right to receive the number of whole shares of OCA
Common Stock, and the cash in lieu of fractional shares, into which the shares
of OrthAlliance Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this Article II. Certificates previously representing shares of
OrthAlliance Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole
shares of OCA Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in
consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance
with Section 3.2 hereof, without any interest thereon.

2.5. Anti-Dilution Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the shares of OCA Common Stock shall be changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period (any such event,
an "Anti-Dilution Event"), the Applicable Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately
and proportionately adjusted to reflect such Anti-Dilution Event, and all
references to the Applicable Exchange Ratio shall thereupon and thereafter be to
the Applicable Exchange Ratio as so adjusted. There shall be no adjustment in
the Exchange Ratio in the event of any change in the price of OCA Common Stock,
OrthAlliance Class A Common Stock or OrthAlliance Class B Common Stock or any
other matter, other than for Anti-Dilution Events. All shares of OCA Common
Stock that are issuable in the Merger shall be deemed for all purposes to have
been issued by OCA at the Effective Time.



                                       6
<PAGE>   11

2.6. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of OCA Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to OCA Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
OCA. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, OCA shall pay to each
holder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of OCA
Common Stock pursuant to the Merger an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the Closing Price (as defined below), times (y) the fraction of a share of
OCA Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Article II hereof. The "Closing Price" means the average of the last
reported sale prices of OCA Common Stock, as reported by the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") Composite Transactions Reporting System (as reported in The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually agreeable to the parties), for the three NYSE trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

2.7. Cancellation of Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of
OrthAlliance Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by OCA or
OrthAlliance or any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and no stock of OCA or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

2.8. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of OrthAlliance Class B Common Stock which are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and with respect to which appraisal
rights shall have been properly demanded in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL ("OrthAlliance Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive, or be exchangeable for, OCA Common Stock or cash in lieu of fractional
shares but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to payment of the
appraised value of such OrthAlliance Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder
of OrthAlliance Dissenting Shares shall subsequently deliver a written
withdrawal of his demand for appraisal of such shares, or (ii) if any holder
fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in Section
262 of the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the
right to appraisal of such shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock and each of such
shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into the right to
receive, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, OCA
Common Stock and/or cash in lieu of fractional shares, without any interest
thereon, as provided in this Article II. OrthAlliance shall give OCA prompt
notice of any demands for appraisal received by OrthAlliance, withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received
by OrthAlliance, and the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. OrthAlliance shall not,
except with the prior written consent of OCA, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

2.9. Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each unexpired option or warrant
granted by OrthAlliance to purchase shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock (each a
"OrthAlliance Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
OrthAlliance Common Stock and shall automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof be assumed by OCA and converted into an option or
warrant, as applicable, to purchase a number of shares of OCA Common Stock at an
exercise price determined as follows:



                                       7
<PAGE>   12

         (a) The number of shares of OCA Common Stock to be subject to such
option or warrant as so converted shall be equal to the product of the number of
shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock theretofore subject to the option or warrant
times the Applicable Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of OCA
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share; and

         (b) The exercise price per share of OCA Common Stock under such option
or warrant as so converted shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
OrthAlliance Common Stock theretofore under the option or warrant divided by the
Applicable Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up
to the nearest cent.

At the Effective Time, the other terms of each such OrthAlliance Option shall
continue to apply in accordance with the terms thereof, the applicable stock
option plan and applicable law, except that references to OrthAlliance and its
Subsidiaries shall mean OCA and its Subsidiaries.

2.10. Effect on OCA Common Stock. Except for any shares of OCA Common Stock
owned by OrthAlliance or any of its Subsidiaries, which shall be converted into
treasury stock, the shares of OCA Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and
such shares shall remain issued and outstanding.

2.11. Conversion of Merger Sub Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of OCA as the sole stockholder of OCA
Merger Sub, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of OCA Merger Sub ("OCA Merger Sub Common Stock") will convert into
one share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.12. Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of OCA Merger Sub, as in effect
at the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.13. Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
OCA Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law and the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.

2.14. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective
Time, the directors of OCA Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the individuals designated therefor by the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. At or prior to the Closing, OrthAlliance shall deliver to OCA
written resignations of each of the directors of OrthAlliance, in form and
substance satisfactory to OCA, with such resignations to be effective as of the
Effective Time.

2.15. Tax Consequences; Accounting Treatment. It is intended that the Merger
shall (i) constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code and that this



                                       8
<PAGE>   13

Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code, and (ii) be accounted for as a purchase under GAAP.

2.16. Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated herein (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, A
Professional Limited Liability Company, Nashville, Tennessee at 10:00 a.m.
Nashville time on a date designated by OCA within five Business Days following

conditions set forth herein, each of OrthAlliance, OCA and OCA Merger Sub will
execute and deliver the instruments, certificates and other documents to be
executed and delivered hereunder or as may be reasonably requested by any party
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, all in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the parties hereto and their respective counsel.


                         ARTICLE III. EXCHANGE OF SHARES

3.1. Deposit of Exchange Fund with Transfer Agent. Promptly following the
Effective Time, OCA shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
EquiServe or such other bank or trust company (the "Exchange Agent") selected by
OCA and reasonably satisfactory to OrthAlliance, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III,
certificates representing the shares of OCA Common Stock and the cash in lieu of
fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of OCA Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued or paid pursuant to
Article II in exchange for outstanding shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock.

3.2. Exchange of Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, OCA shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing the shares of OCA Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional
shares into which the shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and
the Exchange Agent shall promptly mail to such holder following such surrender
(i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of OCA Common Stock
to which such holder of OrthAlliance Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to Article II and (ii) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

3.3. No Dividends Paid To Holders of Unsurrendered Certificates. No dividends or
other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to OCA Common
Stock and payable



                                       9
<PAGE>   14

to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article III. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Article III, the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of
OCA Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

3.4. Issuance of Certificate in Name Differing From Surrendered Certificate. If
any certificate representing shares of OCA Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor
is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an
appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of OCA Common Stock in any name other than that
of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any
other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

3.5. Closing of Stock Transfer Books. Upon and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of OrthAlliance of the shares
of OrthAlliance Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of OCA Common Stock
as provided in this Article III.

3.6. Termination of Exchange Fund. Promptly following the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will deliver to OCA all cash,
certificates (including any representing shares of OCA Common Stock) and other
documents in its possession relating to the transactions this Agreement
describes, and the Exchange Agent's duties will terminate. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of OrthAlliance for 12
months after the Effective Time shall be paid to OCA. Any stockholders of
OrthAlliance who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to OCA for payment of their shares of OCA Common Stock,
cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on OCA
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of OrthAlliance Common Stock
such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of OCA,
OrthAlliance, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of OrthAlliance Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws (collectively, "Escheat Law"). If any Certificate is not
surrendered prior to the end of the applicable period after the Effective Time
under any applicable Escheat Law (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which any shares of OCA Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
OCA Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to such
Certificates would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority) and such shares, cash and dividends or distributions
with respect to such Certificates will, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of OCA, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.



                                       10
<PAGE>   15

3.7. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by OCA or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as OCA or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against OCA or the Exchange Agent with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of OCA Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.


           ARTICLE IV. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ORTHALLIANCE

         OrthAlliance hereby represents and warrants to OCA and OCA Merger Sub
that, except as set forth in the disclosure schedule dated as of the date hereof
and signed by an authorized officer of OrthAlliance, with each such exception

OrthAlliance is duly qualified and in good standing to transact business as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the ownership or use of its
assets and properties and the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except such jurisdictions, individually or in the aggregate, in
which the failure to be so qualified does not have, and would not be reasonably
expected to have, an OrthAlliance Material Adverse Effect. True, accurate and
complete copies of OrthAlliance's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other
governing documents, and all amendments thereto, in each case as in effect on
the date hereof, have heretofore been delivered or made available to OCA.

transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the OrthAlliance Documents, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by the Board of
Directors of OrthAlliance at a meeting duly called and held and at which a
quorum was present and acting throughout, by the requisite affirmative vote of
the directors of OrthAlliance, and the Board of Directors of OrthAlliance has
determined that the Merger is in the best interests of OrthAlliance and its
stockholders, approved this Agreement and the Merger, recommended to the
stockholders of OrthAlliance that they approve and adopt this Agreement and
directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be
submitted to the stockholders of OrthAlliance for approval by such stockholders
at a duly called meeting of such stockholders. No other corporate proceedings on
the part of OrthAlliance are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or, except for the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
vote of OrthAlliance's stockholders in accordance with the DGCL and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of OrthAlliance, the consummation by
OrthAlliance of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by OrthAlliance, and, assuming due
execution and delivery by OCA and OCA Merger Sub, this



                                       11
<PAGE>   16

Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement and obligation of
OrthAlliance, enforceable against OrthAlliance in accordance with its terms
(except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws now or
hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles, regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in law or in equity).

4.3. Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing with, and declaration of
effectiveness by, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")

and consents as may be required under any environmental, health or safety law or
regulation pertaining to any notification, disclosure or required approval
necessitated by the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (g) requisite
consent to consummation of the Merger by the lenders under the OrthAlliance
Credit Agreement, and (h) such other authorizations, consents, approvals or

documents (including all exhibits, post-effective amendments and supplements)

the "OCA SEC Reports"), all of which OCA SEC Reports, as amended if applicable,
complied when filed in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the appropriate act and the rules and regulations thereunder. OCA has previously
delivered or made available to OrthAlliance copies (including all exhibits,
post-effective amendments and supplements) of the OCA SEC Reports. None of OCA's
Subsidiaries is or has been required to file any reports, schedules, forms,
registration statements, proxy statements, information statements or other
documents with the SEC. As of their respective dates, the OCA SEC Reports did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         (b) Except as disclosed in the OCA SEC Reports, the audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements of OCA included in the OCA SEC Reports (collectively, the "OCA
Financial Statements") were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of OCA and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the periods
then ended, subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal year-end and audit adjustments and any other adjustments described
therein.

5.7. Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in the OCA SEC Reports, OCA does not have
any Subsidiaries that are required to be disclosed in such OCA SEC Reports. Each

the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted in all material respects. Each
Subsidiary of OCA is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in



                                       31
<PAGE>   36

which the properties it owns, leases or operates or the nature of the business
it conducts makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified and in good standing, when taken together with all such other
failures with respect to all of OCA's Subsidiaries, does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse Effect.

5.8. Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. None of OCA or its Subsidiaries has
incurred any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise) of any nature, except (a) liabilities, obligations or
contingencies that are accrued or reserved against in the OCA 2000 Financial
Statements or reflected in the notes thereto, or were incurred in the ordinary
course of business and consistent with past practices, (b) liabilities,
obligations or contingencies that, individually or in the aggregate, do not
have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse
Effect, and (c) liabilities and obligations that are of a nature not required to
be reflected in the OCA 2000 Financial Statements, and that were incurred in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice.

5.9. Litigation; Decrees. Except as disclosed in the OCA SEC Reports, there are
no claims, suits, actions, arbitration actions, government investigations or
inquiries or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of OCA, threatened
against, relating to or affecting any of OCA or its Subsidiaries, or their
assets or businesses, which seeks to restrain or enjoin the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein or which have, or would reasonably be expected
to have, either alone or in the aggregate with all such claims, actions or other
proceedings, an OCA Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the OCA SEC
Reports, there are no decrees, injunctions, writs or orders of any court or
governmental department or agency applicable to any of OCA or its Subsidiaries,
or their assets or businesses, or which prohibits or restricts the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein or which have, or would reasonably be
expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse Effect.

5.10. Compliance with Law. OCA and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all applicable Laws of the United States of America and any applicable
foreign jurisdictions, all state and local governments and other Governmental
Authorities, and agencies and courts of any of the foregoing, to which any of
OCA or its Subsidiaries is subject, and none of OCA or its Subsidiaries has
received any notice to the effect that, or otherwise been advised that, any of
OCA or its Subsidiaries has violated or is not in compliance with any of such
Laws, and, to the knowledge of OCA, there are no investigations with respect
thereto; except in each case with respect to non-compliance or violations that,
individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse Effect. OCA and its Subsidiaries have
all permits necessary to conduct their businesses as currently conducted, except
for permits, the absence of which, in the aggregate, do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse Effect, and none of OCA
and its Subsidiaries is in violation of the terms of any such permit, except for
delays in filing reports or violations that do not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, an OCA Material Adverse Effect.

5.11. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the OCA SEC
Reports, since December 31, 2000, none of OrthAlliance or its Subsidiaries has
operated other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, or incurred, experienced or suffered any OCA Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>   37

5.12. Reorganization. OCA has no reason to believe that the Merger will fail to
qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

5.13. Brokers and Finders. OCA and its Subsidiaries have not entered into any
contract, arrangement or understanding with any Person or firm (other than Banc
of America Securities LLC) which may result in the obligation of OrthAlliance or
any of its subsidiaries to pay any finder's fees, brokerage fees, agent
commissions or similar fees, commissions or payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and there is no claim for payment of any such
fees, commissions or payments in connection with the negotiations leading to
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

disclosure to OrthAlliance's stockholders if the Board of Directors of
OrthAlliance determines in good faith that the failure to do so would violate
the fiduciary obligations of such Board of Directors under applicable law;
provided, however, that, except as otherwise permitted in Section 6.4(b),
neither OrthAlliance nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall
withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, its position with respect
to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or propose to approve

                  (i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any tender or exchange
         offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business
         combination involving OrthAlliance or any Subsidiary of OrthAlliance or
         any proposal, inquiry or offer to acquire in any manner, in a single
         transaction or a series of related transactions, all or 15% or greater
         equity interest in, or all or a substantial portion of the assets of,
         OrthAlliance or any Subsidiary of OrthAlliance, other than the
         transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement; and

                  (ii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a bona fide, written
         Acquisition Proposal to acquire all or substantially all of the capital
         stock or assets of OrthAlliance made by a Person which is not an

         which the Board of Directors of OrthAlliance determines in good faith
         that such Acquisition Proposal would be more favorable to OrthAlliance
         and its stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby, that
         financing for such transaction, to the extent required, is fully
         committed or is reasonably capable of being obtained by such Person and
         that such transaction is reasonably capable of being consummated
         without undue delay.

6.5. Registration Statement and Proxy Statement. As soon as practicable

will be included as a prospectus. Each of OCA and OrthAlliance shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by
the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing,
to thereafter cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to OrthAlliance's
stockholders as promptly as practicable, and to keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger. OCA shall
also use its reasonable best efforts (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not currently qualified) to obtain all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties will, promptly upon
receipt of written comments from the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement and the documents incorporated by reference
therein, provide copies thereof to the other party, consult with each other and
prepare written responses to such comments. The parties will promptly furnish to
the other all information concerning such party and other matters relevant to
such party, its stockholders and the transactions contemplated herein, and take
such other actions, as the other party or parties hereto may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement. Each of OCA and OrthAlliance agrees that none of the
information such party provides for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement will (i) in the case of the
Registration Statement, at the time it becomes effective and at the Effective
Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy Statement,
at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement and at the time of the
OrthAlliance Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities
Act, and the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Exchange Act.

recommend to its stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby.

6.7. Affiliates. Within 30 days following the date hereof, OrthAlliance shall

provided) occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of OrthAlliance and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") as provided by OrthAlliance or its
Subsidiaries in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation and
bylaws shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for a period of six years from and after the

connection therewith shall be assumed by OCA.

         (b) OCA shall cause each person serving as a director or officer of
OrthAlliance immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period
of six years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy maintained by OrthAlliance (provided that OCA may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by
such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that
in no event shall OCA be required to expend on an annual basis more than 200% of
the current amount expended by OrthAlliance (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain
or procure insurance coverage, and further provided that if OCA is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.9, OCA shall use
all reasonable efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available
for the Insurance Amount.

         (c) In the event OCA or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision



                                       40

or other Laws or by obligations pursuant to any applicable listing agreement or
standard with or of the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market, as applicable, in which
case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making
any such public announcements.

with the printing and filing of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement and with filings under the HSR Act (other than legal, accounting,
investment banking and financial advisory fees and expenses, which shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees and expenses) will be shared equally by OCA and
OrthAlliance. The foregoing shall not affect the legal right, if any, that any
party hereto may have to recover expenses from any other party that breaches its
obligations hereunder.

6.12. Notification. Each of OrthAlliance and OCA agree to (a) give prompt notice
to the other party, and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
prevent or promptly remedy, (i) upon such party obtaining knowledge thereof, the
occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or
failure to occur, of any event whose occurrence or failure to occur would be
likely to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, and (ii) any material failure on its part to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it hereunder and (b) give prompt notice to the other party of any fact which, if
known by it on the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or

further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the

Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action
as may be reasonably requested by OCA.

6.14. Reasonable Best Efforts, Cooperation.

and agrees to:

         applicable waiting period, shall make any further filings or
         information submissions pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper
         or advisable, and shall (A) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
         comply as expeditiously as possible with all lawful requests of the FTC
         or the Antitrust Division for additional information and documents and
         (B) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
         agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the

         that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
         consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by

         regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement;

                  (iii) Use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to
         qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
         the Code and to forebear from taking any action that would cause the
         Merger not to qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
         Section 368(a) of the Code;

                  (iv) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this

         such counsel.
