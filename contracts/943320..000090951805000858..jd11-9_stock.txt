Trump License     iv   STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT    This STOCK
PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of November 3, 2005 (the "Agreement"), is
entered into by and between THE MAJESTIC STAR CASINO, LLC, an Indiana limited
liability company ("Purchaser") and TRUMP ENTERTAINMENT RESORTS HOLDINGS,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Seller"). Capitalized terms
not defined elsewhere herein have the meanings set forth in Section
12.01.   WHEREAS, Seller is the owner of all the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Trump Indiana, Inc. ("Trump Indiana" or the "Company" and
the shares of Trump Indiana are referred to herein as the "Shares");  
WHEREAS, Trump Indiana is the owner of (i) 50% of the outstanding membership
interest of Buffington Harbor Riverboats, L.L.C. ("BHR") and (ii) 50% of the
outstanding membership interest of Buffington Harbor Parking Associates, LLC
("BHPA");   WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in the business of owning
and operating a riverboat casino (the "Riverboat") and land-based hotel
located in Gary, Indiana (collectively, the "Business"), and in connection
therewith holds, through its ownership interests in BHR and BHPA, an interest
in the related pavilion and parking deck;   WHEREAS, Seller desires to
sell, and Purchaser desires to purchase, the Shares for the consideration and
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I  SALE OF STOCK AND CLOSING   1.01 Purchase and Sale.
Upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller will sell,
convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser and Purchaser will purchase
from Seller, the Shares.   1.02 Purchase Price.   (a) The purchase price
for the Shares shall be Two Hundred Fifty-Three Million Dollars
($253,000,000.00) (A) minus the sum of the following: (i) 50% of the amount
of long term debt and capitalized lease obligations and other non-current
liabilities of BHR and BHPA as of the Closing Date ("Joint Venture Closing
Date Indebtedness"), (ii) the amount of any long term debt, capitalized lease
obligations and other non-current liabilities of the Company as of the
Closing Date ("Company Closing Date Indebtedness"), (iii) the $2.0 million
Riverboat Owner\'s License transfer fee required under Indiana law, (iv) the
severance obligations to Employees in the amounts listed on Exhibit A to the
extent not satisfied by the Company prior to the Closing, (v) the Commitment
Fee and (vi) the Development Agreement Obligation, (B) plus or minus the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment (pursuant to Section 1.02(b)) and (C)
plus or minus the Estimated Cash on Hand Adjustment (pursuant to
Section 1.02(c)) (the net amount being the "Initial Purchase Price"). Upon
execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller a deposit of Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) (the "Deposit"). At the Closing, the Deposit
shall be credited against the Initial Purchase Price. In the event this
Agreement is terminated, the Deposit shall be payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 11.02(b). The Initial Purchase Price shall be subject
to adjustment post-closing pursuant to Section 1.02(c) and 1.03.    (b)
Not less than three Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller will
provide Purchaser a written certification executed by the Chief
Financial Officer of Seller setting forth the estimated Initial Purchase
Price and calculation thereof, including the Joint Venture Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Company Closing Date Indebtedness, estimated Cash on Hand
Adjustment (pursuant to subsection (c)) (the "Estimated Cash on Hand") and
estimated Working Capital ("Estimated Working Capital") of the Company as of
the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date. The Estimated
Working Capital shall be determined by Seller in accordance with the
methodology set forth in Section 1.03 for preparing the Working Capital
Statement The "Estimated Working Capital Adjustment" shall mean the amount by
which the Estimated Working Capital is more or less than Target Working
Capital. The "Estimated Cash on Hand Adjustment" shall mean the amount by
which the Cash on Hand as of the Closing Date is expected to be more or less
than Minimum Cash.   (c) On the Closing Date, Seller will conduct a physical
count of the Casino Cash and provide bank confirmation of cash in the bank
(collectively, the "Cash on Hand"). Purchaser shall have the right to
designate representatives to monitor and observe such physical count. Based
upon the results of such physical count, Seller will provide Purchaser a
written certification executed by the Chief Financial Officer of Seller
setting forth the amount of Cash on Hand, and recalculation of the amount by
which Cash on Hand is more or less than Minimum Cash (the "Cash on Hand
Adjustment"). Within three Business Days after the Closing Date, (iii) if the
Actual Cash on Hand is greater than the Minimum Cash on Hand, Purchaser shall
deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Seller in writing for the Initial Purchase Price, an amount
equal to such excess minus the Estimated Cash on Hand Adjustment (if
such amount increased the Initial Purchase Price) or plus the Estimated Cash
on Hand Adjustment (if such amount decreased the Initial Purchase Price); and
(iv) if the Actual Cash on Hand is less than the Minimum Cash on Hand then
Seller shall deliver by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account specified by the Purchaser in writing, an amount equal to such
deficiency minus the Estimated Cash on Hand Adjustment (if such amount
decreased the Initial Purchase Price) or plus the Estimated Cash on Hand
Adjustment (if such amount increased the Initial Purchase Price).   1.03
Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price.  
(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement
setting forth the Working Capital (the "Working Capital Statement"). The
Working Capital Statement shall be prepared (i) in accordance with GAAP; (ii)
consistent with the Company\'s past practice used in calculating the  
2  components of working capital for the Financial Statements; and (iii)
consistent with the principles and methods set forth on Exhibit C (which
Working Capital calculation shall include a reserve for TITO liability as to
the Actual Working Capital but not the Target Working Capital and shall not
include any reserves for income Taxes, real property Taxes or gaming Taxes).
In the event that the principles and methods set forth on Exhibit C differ
from the Company\'s past practices used in calculating the components of
working capital for the Financial Statements or from GAAP, the Estimated
Working Capital and the Actual Working Capital shall be determined in
accordance with the principles and methods set forth on Exhibit C. Following
the delivery of the Working Capital Statement, Purchaser shall give Seller
and the independent accountants of Seller access at all reasonable times to
the properties, books, records and personnel of the Company and the working
papers of Purchaser and Purchaser\'s auditors relating to the Working Capital
Statement. Seller shall have sixty (60) days following delivery to Seller of
the Working Capital Statement during which to notify Purchaser in writing of
any dispute of any item contained in the Working Capital Statement, which
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and
the Working Capital proposed by Seller (the "Dispute Notice"). If Seller
fails to notify Purchaser in writing of any dispute within such sixty-day
period, the Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to be a "Final
Statement." In the event that Seller shall so notify Purchaser of any dispute
on or prior to such sixtieth day, any amounts contained in the
Working Capital Statement that are not disputed by Seller in the Dispute
Notice shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of
calculating the Actual Working Capital. For a period of fifteen (15) days
following the delivery of the Dispute Notice to Purchaser, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (or the person or persons
performing similar functions) of each of Purchaser and Seller shall attempt
to resolve in good faith the amounts disputed in the Dispute Notice. During
such fifteen-day period, Purchaser shall be permitted to review the working
papers of Seller and Seller\'s auditors relating to the Working Capital
Statement and the Dispute Notice, and Seller shall be permitted to review the
working papers of Purchaser and Purchaser\'s auditors relating to the Working
Capital Statement. Amounts resolved by such attempts within such fifteen (15)
day period shall be deemed to have been finally determined for purposes of
calculating the Actual Working Capital.   (b) If Purchaser and Seller are
unable to resolve any such dispute prior to the end of such fifteen (15) day
period, an accounting firm mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller
(the "Independent Accounting Firm") shall be appointed by Purchaser and
Seller to resolve such dispute and such determination shall be final and
binding on the parties to this Agreement. If Purchaser and Seller cannot
mutually agree on the selection of the Independent Accounting Firm, Purchaser
and Seller shall submit to such other Person\'s independent accountants the
name of a nationally recognized accounting firm which does not at the time
and has not in the prior two years provided audit or other services to either
the Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms by
the independent accountants of Purchaser and Seller. The Independent
Accounting Firm so appointed may not make any determination with respect to
any matter not set forth in the Dispute Notice and the Independent Accounting
Firm\'s determination shall not be more than the Working Capital set forth in
the Dispute Notice or less than the amount of the Working Capital set forth
in the Working Capital Statement. Each of Purchaser and Seller and
their respective independent accountants shall give the Independent
Accounting Firm access at all reasonable times to the properties, books,
records and personnel of the Company for purposes of reviewing the Dispute
Notice and the Working Capital Statement and calculating the Actual Working
Capital. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every
reasonable effort to perform its services within thirty (30) days of
submission of the Dispute Notice and the Working Capital Statement to it and,
in any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. The Working
Capital Statement, as modified by resolution of any disputes by Purchaser and
Seller or by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be deemed to be a "Final
Statement."    3   (c) Any expenses relating to the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by Purchaser and Seller in inverse
proportion to the percentage of the dollar value of the disputed items
prevailed upon by each Person. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall pay all
advisors\' fees, charges and expenses incurred by such Person in connection
with the dispute.   (d) The Initial Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
follows: (i) if the Actual Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital, then Purchaser shall within ten (10) days of Purchaser\'s
receipt of the Final Statement, deliver by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by Seller in writing, an amount equal
to such excess; and (ii) if the Actual Working Capital is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, then Seller shall, within ten (10) days of
Seller\'s receipt of the Final Statement, deliver by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Purchaser in
writing, an amount equal to such deficiency.   1.04 Closing.   (a) The
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Dykema Gossett PLLC, 400 Renaissance Center, Detroit,
Michigan 48243, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the later of (i) three Business
Days following the date on which all conditions to the obligations of both
parties set forth in Articles VI and VII hereof shall have been satisfied or
validly waived, or (ii) or at such other time and place or on such other date
as Purchaser and Seller may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date," and the
Closing shall be deemed to have occurred as of and with effect from 7:00 a.m.
central time on the Closing Date.   (b) At the Closing, Purchaser will
deliver the (x) Initial Purchase Price minus the Escrow Funds by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated in
writing by Seller and (y) the Escrow Funds to the Escrow Agent.   (c) At
the Closing, Seller will assign and transfer to Purchaser all of Seller\'s
rights, title and interests in and to the Shares (free and clear of all
Liens, other than Permitted Liens) by delivery of stock certificates or other
evidence of transfer representing all of the Shares, duly endorsed in blank
(or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, and such other instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, as shall be effective to vest in
Purchaser all of Seller\'s rights, title and interests in and to the Shares).
The stock powers and any other instruments necessary to effect the transfer
of the Shares in and to Purchaser are collectively referred to herein as the
"Assignment Instruments."    4   (d) At the Closing, there shall also be
delivered to Seller, the Company and Purchaser the certificates and other
contracts, documents and instruments required to be delivered under Articles
VI and VII.   1.05 Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation.   (a)
From time to time after the Closing, at Purchaser\'s request and without
further consideration, Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser such
other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information as are within Seller\'s possession or
control and take such other actions consistent with this Agreement as
Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order
more effectively to transfer, convey and assign to Purchaser, and to
confirm Purchaser\'s title to, the Shares and to the full extent permitted by
Law, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control of the
Assets and Properties of the Company other than the Excluded Rights, and
otherwise to cause Seller to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and
the Operative Agreements.   (b) From time to time after the Closing, at
Seller\'s request and without further consideration, Purchaser shall execute
and deliver to Seller such instruments of transfer, conveyance, assignment
and confirmation, and provide such materials and information as are within
Purchaser\'s or the Company\'s possession or control and take such other
actions consistent with this Agreement as Seller may reasonably deem
necessary or desirable in order to transfer, convey and assign to Seller, and
to confirm Seller\'s exclusive right and title to, the Excluded Rights, and
otherwise to fulfill Purchaser\'s obligations under this Agreement.   (c)
Following the Closing, each party will afford the other party, their counsel
and their accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable access to the
books, records and other data relating to the Business in its possession or
control with respect to periods prior to the Closing and the right to make
copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that such access may
be reasonably required by the requesting party in connection with (i)
the preparation of Tax Returns or in connection with any audit, amended
return, claim for refund or any suit or proceeding with respect thereto, (ii)
the determination or enforcement of rights or obligations under this
Agreement or any of the Operative Agreements, (iii) compliance with the
requirements of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or the obtaining of
an approval from a Governmental or Regulatory Authority, (iv) accounting and
audit requirements, (v) securities filings and other regulatory filings in
accordance with Law and (vi) any actual or threatened Action or Proceeding.
Each party further agrees for a period of six years commencing on the Closing
Date not to destroy or otherwise dispose of any such books, records and other
data unless such party first offers in writing to surrender such books,
records and other data to the other parties and such other party does not
agree in writing to take possession thereof within ten days after such offer
is made.   (d) If, in order to properly prepare its Tax Returns, other
documents or reports required to be filed with Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities or its financial statements or to fulfill its obligations
hereunder, a party needs to be furnished with additional information,
documents or records relating to the Business not referred to in paragraph
(c) of this Section, and such information, documents or records are in the
possession or control of another party hereto, such other party shall make
its best efforts to furnish or make available such information, documents or
records (or copies thereof) at the recipient\'s request, and the actual out-
of-pocket cost and expenses of the providing party shall be reimbursed by the
other party.    5   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section, if the parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or
arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records that relate
to the matter in controversy shall be governed by applicable rules relating
to discovery, rather than by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Section.   1.06
Exclusions. Notwithstanding anything herein that may be to the contrary,
Seller shall retain and not transfer, and Purchaser shall not purchase or
acquire, or have any ownership claim or right, in any of the
following (collectively, the "Excluded Rights"): (i) subject to the rights
granted to the Purchaser pursuant to the Trump License, the name "Trump" in

which are Seller\'s corporate records and which do not principally relate to
the Company, provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right prior to
or after the Closing to review and make copies of such portions of such Books
and Records that relate to or are used by the Company; (iii) rights and
claims of the Company in respect of liabilities retained by Seller or removed
by Seller from the Company prior to the Closing, including, without
limitation, tax refunds and credits attributable to the operations of the
Company prior to the Closing Date; and (iv) rights and claims of the Company,
if any, in respect of the Affiliate Agreements.   ARTICLE II

available against the Seller at law or in equity, Purchaser shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief against the
Seller without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond.

It is the intention of each party hereto that the provisions of this Section
4.07 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and
the public policies of the State of Indiana, and of any other jurisdiction in
which enforcement may be sought, but that the unenforceability (or the
modification to conform with such laws or public policies) of any provisions
hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair the remainder of
this Agreement. Accordingly, if any term or provision of this Section is
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, either in whole or in
part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete or modify, as
necessary, the offending provisions and to alter the balance of this
Agreement in order to render the same valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permissible as aforesaid.   (e) For purposes of this Section 4.07,

establishments conducting a casino, bingo, poker, race book, sports book,

CLOSING TAXES   8.01 Pre-Closing Taxes. Seller shall be and remain liable
for any Taxes due pursuant to any subsequent deficiency determinations which
relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Return or the period of time prior to Closing
with respect to any Straddle-Period Tax Return. In the event the Company
receives notice of, or correspondence with respect to, any deficiency,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, dispute or other claim
with respect to such tax returns for the period prior to the Closing Date (a
"Tax Claim"), the Purchaser shall promptly provide Seller with a copy of such
notice or correspondence. Seller shall have the right to control the defense
and/or settlement of any Tax Claim, subject to the provisions of Section
8.02(b).    40   8.02 Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying
Taxes.   (a) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all (i) Tax Returns for the Company for all periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Tax Returns"); and (ii) all Tax Returns of the Company for all
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date
("Straddle-Period Tax Returns"). Purchaser shall provide to Seller, at least
forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for filing, a draft of each such
Pre-Closing and Straddle-Period Tax Return for Seller\'s review and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. During such
forty-five (45) day period, Seller shall be permitted to review the books and
records of the Company and the working papers of the Company and Company\'s
accountants reasonably related to the preparation of such returns. To the
extent Seller\'s review and approval is unreasonably withheld or delayed,
Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for any fines, penalties or interest arising
out of a delay in filing such Pre-Closing and Straddle-Period Tax Return
resulting therefrom. Any dispute regarding the manner in which such returns
should be prepared, including any position taken or disclosure made therein,
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section
1.03(b) of this Agreement. Seller shall timely pay or cause to be paid (i)
all Taxes relating to Pre-Closing Tax Returns and (ii) all Taxes relating to
the period ending on or before the Closing Date for all Straddle-Period Tax
Returns (Taxes of the Company described in Sections 8.02(a)(i) and
8.02(a)(ii) are referred to as "Pre-Closing Taxes") in each case to the
extent such Pre-Closing Taxes (other than income, gaming and property Taxes)
exceed the reserve therefore on the Final Statement. For purposes of
this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax which relates
to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in
the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the
Closing Date. In addition, any credits relating to a taxable period that
begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken pro rata as
though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations and the
preparation of such returns shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the Company providing substantial authority exists for such
positions and such positions are in accordance with any settlement reached
with the Service for the 1995-2004 audit period.   (b) Without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
neither the Company nor Seller shall make or change any election, change an
annual accounting period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any
amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax Claim or
assessment relating to the Company, surrender any right to claim a refund of
Taxes, consent to any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company, or take any other
similar action relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any
Tax (collectively, a "Tax Action"), if such Tax Action would have the effect
of increasing the Tax liability of the Company for any period ending after
the Closing Date other than by reason of decreasing the federal net   
41  operating loss carryover of the Company existing on the Closing Date to
an amount not less than $2,000,000 (the "Minimum Net Operating Loss
Carryover"). In the event any Tax Action would reduce the net operating loss
carryover of the Company on the Closing Date below the Minimum Net Operating
Loss Carryover Seller may, at its option, (i) take such Tax Action after
obtaining the prior consent of Purchaser or (ii) take such Tax Action and
provide Seller with an Economic Equivalent Amount equal to $.40 multiplied by
the difference between the Minimum Net Operating Loss Carryover and the
actual net operating loss carryover of the Company on the Closing Date as a
result of such Tax Action (which product shall in no event exceed $800,000).
For purposes of the preceding sentence the phrase "Economic Equivalent
Amount" shall mean (x) a cash payment to Purchaser from Seller, (y) minimum
tax credits within the meaning of Section 53 of the Code which are available
to offset the regular corporate income Tax liability of the Company for
taxable periods ending after the Closing and which exceed the amount of such
credits that would exist had the Tax Action resulted in a net operating loss
carryover of $2,000,000 as of the Closing Date Date on a present value basis
calculated using the mid-term applicable federal rate in effect on the date
of the Tax Action for each affected year assuming the credit is utilized
evenly over the next succeeding five years, or (z) any combination of items
(x) and (y). By way of example, if a Tax Action reduces the actual federal
net operating loss carryover of the Company available on the Closing Date to
$1,000,000, Seller may take such Tax Action provided it pays
Purchaser $400,000. In the alternative, if after such Tax Action additional
minimum tax credits are available, over what would have been available had
the Tax Action resulted in a $2,000,000 net operating loss carryover, in an
amount sufficient to offset $200,000 of regular corporate income tax
liability of the Company, Seller may take such Tax Action and pay the
Purchaser $200,000 notwithstanding that the Purchaser would assume the
federal net operating loss of $1,000,000.   (c) Without the prior written
consent of Seller, with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Returns and Straddle-
Period Tax Returns, neither the Company nor Purchaser shall make or change
any election, change an annual accounting period, adopt or change any
accounting method, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing
agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment relating to the Company,
surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment
relating to the Company, or take any other similar action relating to the
filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxes or decreasing any Tax
attribute of the Company existing on or before the Closing Date unless such
adjustment is required by Law.   (d) Seller shall not seek any refund for
Taxes paid relating to that certain settlement agreement of the Company with
the Indiana Department of Revenue, dated March 23, 2005, unless Seller shall
have posted, for the benefit of Purchaser, security in the amount of
$4,000,000 for any State of Indiana Pre-Closing Taxes that may become payable
by the Company as a result of such refund application and any Losses related
thereto, such security at Seller\'s option to be in the form of a letter of
credit or cash collateral.    42   8.03 Tax Indemnification.   (a)
After the Closing Date, Seller will indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, liabilities,
losses, damages, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs resulting
from, arising out of or relating to (i) Pre-Closing Taxes of the Company;
(ii) any Taxes of the Company measured by income or receipts (including,
without limitation, any Tax liability that arises solely by reason of the
Company being severally liable for any Tax of any current or former Affiliate
of the Company pursuant to Treasury Regulation "1.1502-6 or any analogous
state or local Tax provision) and all other Taxes of the Company except those
described in Section 8.03(b); and (iii) all Taxes described in Section 8.01
in each case (except for income, gaming and property taxes), net of any
reserve therefor on the Final Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Seller shall not indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from any
liability for Taxes for periods following the Closing Date or for Pre-Closing
Taxes which are attributable to a breach by the Purchaser of its obligations
under Section 8.02(c) of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section
8.03(a) shall not be subject to the limitations or procedures of Article
X.   (b) Purchaser will be responsible for and Purchaser will indemnify and
hold Seller harmless against any all liabilities with respect to Taxes
for any Taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date and, with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser (and the
Company) shall not indemnify and hold harmless the Seller from any liability
for Pre-Closing Taxes or which is attributable to a breach by the Seller of
its obligations under this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 8.03(b)
shall not be subject to the limitations or procedures of Article X.   8.04
Tax Cooperation. After the Closing Date, Seller will cooperate with
Purchaser, and Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, in the preparation
of all Tax Returns and will provide (or cause to be provided) any records and
other information the other so requests, and will provide access to, and
the cooperation of its auditors. Seller will cooperate with Purchaser and
Purchaser will cooperate with Seller in connection with any Tax
investigation, audit or other proceeding.   8.05 Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Tax Claims.   (a) If one party is responsible for the
payment of Taxes pursuant to Sections 8.01-8.03 (the "Tax Indemnifying
Party"), and the other party (the "Tax Indemnified Party") receives a Tax
Claim with respect to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly
deliver a copy of such notice to the Tax Indemnifying Party. If a copy of a
Tax Claim is not given to the Tax Indemnifying Party within a sufficient
period of time to allow such party effectively to contest such Tax Claim, the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party (or
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents or representatives) to the extent that the
Tax Indemnifying Party\'s position is actually prejudiced as a result
thereof.    43   (b) With respect to any Tax Claim, the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall assume and control all proceedings taken in connection with such
Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and pursue or forego any and all
administrative proceedings with any taxing authority with respect thereto,
and may either pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the Tax
Claim in any permissible manner at its own expense; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party has the right to review and approve the settlement of
the Tax Claim, such approval shall not be reasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller may defend and/or
settle any Tax Claims (including by paying such Taxes and seeking a refund)
relating to Pre-Closing Taxes as permitted by Sections 8.01 and 8.02(b).  
(c) With respect to any Tax Claim which Seller has the right to control
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 8.05, Seller shall promptly
pay or cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Taxing authority directly the
amount of any Liability as finally determined (provided that if Seller elects
to sue for refund or contest such Liabilities, it shall make or cause
the Escrow Agent to make any payment for which refund is sought).   ARTICLE
IX  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS   The
parties rights and remedies as set forth in Article X of this Agreement with
respect to the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing
until, and terminate on, the fifteen month anniversary of the Closing Date
with respect to all matters except with respect to the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 2.02, 2.03, 2.09, 3.01 and 3.02 which
shall survive until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and
provided further that in the event of fraud, all representations and
warranties shall survive indefinitely; provided that any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate in accordance
with the above provisions of this Article IX will continue to survive if a
Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely given
under Article X on or prior to such termination date, until the related claim
for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in
Article X. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Article IX shall limit any covenant, obligation or agreement
of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the
Effective Time.   ARTICLE X  INDEMNIFICATION   10.01 Indemnification.  
(a) Subject to paragraph (c) of this Section and the other Sections of this
Article X, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all
Losses (without duplication) suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them,
resulting from or arising out of, (i) any breach of representation or
warranty by the Seller in this Agreement (other than Section 2.09), (ii) the
breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement
(other than Section 4.12, as to which the provisions of Section 11.03 shall
provide Purchaser\'s exclusive remedy), (iii) a DLJ Claim, (iv) any claim for
indemnification by a former director of the Company, (v) any fines or
penalties payable to the    44  Indiana Gaming Commission that relate to
matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, (vi) the Noa Litigation or any
claim by Joyce Woods, (vii) any item of tangible Assets and Property
(including each live game, gaming table, electronic gaming device or other
gaming related equipment) which is set forth on the inventory conducted
pursuant to Section 4.03(c) but which is not physically present on the
Improvements, the Riverboat or on real property owned by BHR and/or BHPA as
of the Closing Date, other than assets which have been replaced by assets of
equal or greater value or assets which have been the subject of a known
casualty loss and (viii) actual liability for workers compensation claims or
patron liability (including claims incurred but not reported) from
injuries occurring prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such liability is
in excess of the reserve therefor on the Actual Working Capital up to the
self insured retention limits in effect at the Closing Date. Seller\'s
obligations to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnifying Parties in respect of any
and all Losses arising out of any breach of the representations or warranties
by Seller in Section 2.09 (Taxes) of this Agreement, or amounts payable as a
result of the Pre-Closing Taxes shall be governed by Article VIII.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall
be deemed to have waived its right to indemnification for any breach of any
of Seller\'s representations solely to the extent (x) the facts establishing
the basis for the breach were provided in a written notice to Purchaser under
Section 4.13 and (y) the uninsured Loss related to such breach (or all such
breaches) does not exceed $100,000.   (b) Subject to the other Sections of
this Article X, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller Indemnified Parties in
respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all
Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them
becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any breach
of representation or warranty by Purchaser in this Agreement, (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or
(iii) the operation of the Company and the Business from and after the
Closing Date.   (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any
claim in respect of a Loss arising under Section 10.01(a)(i) unless and until
Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered, incurred or sustained Losses
that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 10.01(a)(i) in
excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Seller\'s Threshold") (except as
provided in the next sentence), in which event Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to claim indemnity (including all related fees and costs)
for the amount by which such Losses exceed the Seller\'s Threshold, provided
that the aggregate Losses indemnified by Seller shall not exceed $30,000,000
(the "Cap"). The Seller\'s Threshold specified in the preceding sentence for
entitlement to claim indemnity under Section 10.01(a)(i) shall not apply to a
breach of a representation or warranty contained in Sections 2.02, 2.03, 2.09
or 2.11(a) and any Loss with respect thereto shall not be counted against the
Seller\'s Threshold. Neither the Seller\'s Threshold nor the Cap shall apply
in the event of a claim for indemnity by Purchaser for any matter set forth
in Article VIII or in Sections 10.01(a)(iii)-(viii) or for any claim based on
a breach of Section   2.11(a). With respect to Losses which are not subject
to the Seller\'s Threshold or the Cap, the Seller shall remain liable for any
such Losses.   (d) In the event that an Indemnifying Party:    45   (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or  
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets (whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to
any Person,   (iii) then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made in connection with the consummation of any such transaction so that
such successors and assigns shall assume the obligations of such Indemnifying
Party set forth in this Article X.   10.02 Method of Asserting Claims. All
claims for indemnification by any Indemnified Party under Section 10.01 shall
be asserted and resolved only as follows:   (a) In the event any claim or
demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity under
Section 10.01 or as to which Seller\'s Threshold may be applied is asserted
against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person
other than Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or of Purchaser (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party and in any event within 30 days of the
time such Indemnified Party learns of such claim or demand. If the
Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with reasonable
promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party\'s ability to defend has been actually prejudiced
by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify
the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the Dispute Period
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified
Party under Section 10.01 and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its
sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute
shall be resolved by arbitration, in accordance with Section 10.02(c).  
(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified
Party with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 10.02(a), then the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be vigorously and diligently
prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to any
settlement that (i) does not contain an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from the subject matter of the settlement, or (ii) with
respect to any non-monetary provision of such settlement, could, in the
Indemnified Party\'s reasonable judgment, have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party\'s delivery of
the notice referred to in the first sentence of this Section 10.02(a)(i),
file any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests without such actions being construed as a waiver of the
Indemnified Party\'s rights to defense and    46  indemnification
pursuant to the Agreement. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to represent it in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section (a)(i), and the Indemnified
Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such separate
counsel except that the Indemnifying Party will pay the costs and expenses of
such separate counsel if (x) in the Indemnified Party\'s good faith judgment,
it is advisable, based on advice of counsel, for the Indemnified Party to
be represented by separate counsel because a conflict exists between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party which makes representation
of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct or (y) the named parties to such Third Party Claim include both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party
determines in good faith, based on advice of counsel, that defenses are
available to it that are unavailable to the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may retain or take over
the control of the defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim the defense
of which the Indemnifying Party has elected to control if the Indemnified
Party irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under Section 10.01 with
respect to such Third Party Claim.   (ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to
notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the Indemnifying
Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 10.02(a),
or if the Indemnifying Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute
vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnified Party in
good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party
without in any way waiving or otherwise affecting the Indemnified Party\'s
rights to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnified Party
will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnified
Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnified Party is contesting. The Indemnifying Party may participate
in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 10.02(a)(ii), and the Indemnifying Party will
bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.   (iii)
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim under Section 10.01 or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim, the Loss arising from such Third Party Claim will be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Section and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss (subject to the
Seller\'s Threshold and the Cap, if applicable) to the Indemnified Party on
demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by
arbitration in accordance with Section 10.02(c).    47   (b) In the event
any Indemnified Party has a claim under Section 10.01 or as to which
Seller\'s Threshold may be applied against any Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an
Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party and in
any event within 30 days of the time such Indemnified Party learns of such
claim. The failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity
Notice shall not impair such party\'s rights hereunder except to the extent
that an Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced
thereby. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it
does not dispute the claim described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to
notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the
Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under Section 10.01
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss (subject to the
Seller\'s Threshold and the Cap, if applicable) to the Indemnified Party on
demand following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party
has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within the Resolution Period, such dispute shall be resolved by
arbitration, in accordance with Section 10.02(c).   (c) All disputes between

that portion of the Holdback claimed by Seller in such notice. If Escrow
Agent receives a written objection from Purchaser (each, a "Dispute") within
such ten (10) Business Day period, Escrow Agent shall retain that portion of
the Holdback until the Dispute is resolved in accordance with Section 4
hereof. All notices to be given or permitted to be given under this Section

----------------------------------------    and   (ii) the "Satisfaction
Amount" with respect to each such taxable year shall equal the amount paid or
otherwise satisfied (including through the use of net operating losses of the
Company) by Seller on behalf of the Company or the Escrow Agent in full
satisfaction of the Contingent Federal Income Tax Claims for such taxable
year pursuant to (x) a closing agreement entered into by Seller (on behalf of
the Company) and the IRS, (y) the payment of a notice of deficiency issued by
the IRS by Seller or the Escrow Agent, or (z) the satisfaction by Seller or
the Escrow Agent of an order or judgment or the entry of an order or judgment
determining that the Company has no liability with respect to such Contingent
Federal Income Tax Claims by a court of competent jurisdiction and the
expiration of time for the IRS to appeal such order or judgment.  4.
Dispute. In the event of a Dispute, Escrow Agent shall not comply with
any notices, claims or demands from either Purchaser or Seller and shall make
no delivery or other disbursement of any property then held by it under this
Escrow Agreement until (i) it has received a final non-appealable court order
from a    4  court of competent jurisdiction directing disposition of the
Holdback, (ii) it has received an order of an arbitrator designated in
writing jointly by Purchaser and Seller directing disbursement of the
Holdback or (iii) it has received written instructions signed by Purchaser
and Seller directing disbursement of the Holdback, in which case, Escrow
Agent shall deliver the Holdback, or a portion thereof, as the case may be,
in accordance with such order or instructions. (Each of the items described
in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are hereinafter referred to as a "Release
Instruction" and collectively as the "Release Instructions".)  5.
Disbursement of the Holdback in Accordance with Release Instructions. If
at any time Escrow Agent receives a Release Instruction, Escrow Agent
shall disburse the Holdback in accordance with, and otherwise comply with,
such Release Instruction. All Release Instructions to be delivered under this
Section 5 shall be delivered as provided in Section 15(a) of this Escrow
Agreement.  6. Remaining Balance of Holdback. If Escrow Agent disburses to
the IRS or U.S. Treasury a portion of but less than all of the Holdback
pursuant to any Release Instructions, that portion of the Holdback not
disbursed (the "Remaining Holdback") shall continue to be held in escrow by
Escrow Agent until released in accordance with the terms of this Escrow
Agreement.  7. Manner of Distributions. All distributions by Escrow Agent
shall be made by bank check or, at the election of the party receiving (or,
in the case of a distribution pursuant to Section 3(b), directing) the
distribution, by federal funds wire transfer. Any wire transfers shall be
made subject to, and in accordance with, the Escrow Agent\'s normal
electronic funds transfer procedures. In the event funds transfer
instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of the execution of
the Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telecopier or otherwise, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by
telephone call-back to the person or persons designated to receive such
funds, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone
purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The parties to
the Escrow Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is
commercially reasonable. It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the
beneficiary\'s bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account
numbers or similar identifying number provided by any party hereto to
identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiary\'s bank or (iii) an
intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply funds for any payment order it
executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may result in
a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a
bank other than the beneficiary\'s bank, or an intermediary bank,
designated.  8. Interpleader. In the event any Dispute should arise among
the parties hereunder which Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve after
five (5) days of good faith negotiations, whether or not litigation has been
instituted, Escrow Agent may at the request of one or both parties or in the
Escrow Agent\'s sole discretion deposit the Holdback with the clerk of any
court of competent jurisdiction in the Federal Court of the United States in
Indiana, and to the extent not so permitted by law then in any Indiana State
Court, and interplead Purchaser and Seller. Any costs of such an interpleader
motion shall be borne by the parties as provided in Section 9 below.   
5  9. Expenses. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
shall be jointly and severally responsible for all of the costs, expenses or
advances incurred or made by Escrow Agent in furtherance of its duties under
this Escrow Agreement, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses of Escrow Agent. Any costs, expenses or advances incurred
or made by Escrow Agent shall be advanced promptly to Escrow Agent upon its
written request, (delivered to all parties and accompanied by appropriate
supporting documentation) by Purchaser and/or Seller, as the case may be. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation for its services hereunder as
per Exhibit B attached hereto, which is made a part hereof, and for
reimbursement of its out-of-pocket expenses including, but not by way of
limitation, the fees and costs of attorneys or agents which it may find
necessary to engage in performance of its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any
unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses or unsatisfied indemnification rights
from amounts on deposit in the Escrow Account. Purchaser and Seller agree to
share equally the fees of the Escrow Agent due in connection with opening the
escrow account. All subsequent fees of the Escrow Agent shall be paid out of
the Holdback.  10. Investment of Holdback.   a. Investment. The Escrow
Agent shall invest and reinvest the Holdback in "Cash Equivalents" (as that
term is defined in that certain Indenture dated as of May 20, 2005, by and
among Seller, Trump Entertainment Resorts Funding, Inc. and U.S. Bank
National Association, as Trustee, with respect to those certain 8 1/2 %
Senior Secured Notes due 2015) as directed from time to time by written
instruction from Seller.   b. Advice/Losses Relating to Investments. In no
instance shall the Escrow Agent have any obligation to provide investment
advice of any kind or to invest the Holdback other than as expressly provided
herein. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any loss incurred upon
any such investment in Cash Equivalents made in good faith and under
circumstances not constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence. The
Escrow Agent may sell or liquidate investments in order to comply with this
Escrow Agreement and instructions issued hereunder, and shall not be
responsible for any loss due to interest rate fluctuation, early withdrawal
penalty or market value changes, provided however, that Escrow Agent shall
consult with Seller and follow the directions of Seller with respect to any
such sale. Purchaser and Seller understand that investments of the Holdback
are not necessarily insured by the United States Government or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, or by any state or municipality, and that such
investments do not necessarily earn a fixed rate of return.   c. Income on
Investments. All income earned on the Holdback, after payment of expenses
incurred in connection therewith, shall be reported as income to Seller and
shall be held and released in the same manner as the Holdback in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Any income earned on the Holdback shall be
disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the Seller as and when directed by Seller.
Any tax returns required to be prepared and filed will be prepared and filed
by Seller with the Internal Revenue Service in all years income is earned,
whether or not income is received or distributed in any particular tax year,
as and to the extent required by law, and the Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for the preparation and/or filing or any tax return with
respect to any income earned by the Holdback. Any taxes payable on
income earned from the investment of any sums held in the escrow account
shall be paid by Seller, whether or not the income was distributed by the
Escrow Agent during any particular year. Seller agrees to provide the Escrow
Agent with a certified tax identification number by signing and returning a
Form W-9 to the Escrow Agent prior to the date on which interest or other
income is first earned by the Holdback. The Seller understands that, in the
event its tax identification number is not certified to the Escrow Agent
prior to any income being earned on the Holdback, the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, may require withholding of a portion of any interest or
other income earned on the investment of the Holdback.    6  11.
Provisions Relating to Escrow Agent. In order to induce Escrow Agent to
act as such hereunder, Purchaser and Seller hereby covenant and agree with
each other and with Escrow Agent as follows:   a. Escrow Agent shall have
no liability under or duty to inquire into the terms and provisions of the
Purchase Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument, and it is
agreed that its duties are purely ministerial in nature, and that Escrow
Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever except as a result of its willful
misconduct or gross negligence.   b. Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any
modification, amendment, termination, cancellation, rescission or
supersession of this Escrow Agreement unless the same shall be in writing and
signed by all of the parties hereto (other than the Escrow Agent) and, if its
duties as Escrow Agent hereunder are affected thereby, unless it shall have
given its prior written consent thereto.   c. Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively and shall be protected in acting upon any
order, judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument, opinion or
written advice of counsel (including counsel chosen by Escrow Agent) or other
writing delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the
authenticity or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety
or validity of the service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any
instrument or signature believed by it in good faith to be genuine and may
assume, if in good faith, that any person purporting to give notice or
receipt or advice to make any statement or execute any document in connection
with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.   d. The
Escrow Agent may consult with and obtain advice from legal counsel in the
event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions hereof or the Escrow Agent\'s duties hereunder, and the Escrow
Agent shall incur no liability and shall be fully protected in acting
or refraining from acting in good faith in accordance with the advice of its
legal counsel. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible in any manner
whatsoever for any failure or inability of any of the other parties hereto,
or anyone else, to perform or comply with any provisions of this Escrow
Agreement.   e. In no event will the Escrow Agent be liable, directly
or indirectly, for any lost profits or other indirect, special, incidental
or consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever which any party may
incur or experience by reason of the Escrow Agent having entered into this
Escrow Agreement or arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agent\'s
services hereunder, even if the Escrow Agent was advised or otherwise made
aware of the possibility of such losses or damages and regardless of the form
of action; nor shall the Escrow Agent be liable for acts of God, war,
terrorism, fire, floods, strikes, electrical outages, breakdowns or
malfunctions of equipment, machines or computers, interruptions or
malfunctions of communications or power supplies, actions of public
authorities, or any other similar cause or catastrophe, in each case beyond
the Escrow Agent\'s reasonable control.    7  12. Discharge or
Resignation. Escrow Agent at any time may: (i) be discharged by the giving to
it of a written notice of termination signed by Seller and Purchaser or (ii)
resign hereunder by giving written notice of its resignation to the other
parties hereto, in either case such discharge or resignation notice to be
given at least thirty (30) days prior to the date specified for
such discharge or resignation to take effect, and upon the effective date
thereof, the Holdback then held by Escrow Agent hereunder shall be delivered
by it to such person as may be mutually agreed upon and designated in writing
by the other parties executing this Escrow Agreement, whereupon all of the
Escrow Agent\'s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. If no such
person shall have been designated by such date, the withdrawing Escrow Agent
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Indiana for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. Such court may
thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, appoint a
successor Escrow Agent. If no new Escrow Agent is so appointed within thirty
(30) days following such petition, Escrow Agent may deposit the Holdback with
any court in the State of Indiana it reasonably deems appropriate, whereupon
Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all further obligations hereunder. Any
successor Escrow Agent appointed as provided in this Section 12 shall execute
and deliver to the parties hereto an instrument in writing accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the withdrawal of the predecessor Escrow
Agent shall become effective, and all obligations of the predecessor Escrow
Agent hereunder shall cease and terminate. The sole responsibility thereafter
of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall be to deliver the Holdback to such
successor Escrow Agent. For all purposes of this Escrow Agreement, the term
"Escrow Agent" shall, subject to the provisions of this Section 12, also
include any successor as Escrow Agent hereunder.  13. Indemnification.
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand (collectively, the
"Indemnitors"), jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend, protect
and hold harmless Escrow Agent from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, claims, proceedings, suits, demands, penalties, costs, damages, taxes
or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses and court costs and experts and their staffs and all expenses of
document location, duplication and shipment and of preparation to defend
any of the foregoing) ("Losses"), incurred by Escrow Agent arising out of or
in connection with its acceptance of appointment or performance as Escrow
Agent hereunder, except to the extent such Losses shall have been finally
adjudicated to have been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall not be under any obligation to
institute suit or defend any claim, action or proceeding by reason of its
serving as Escrow Agent hereunder or having custody of the Holdback unless
and until the expenses of any such claim, action or proceeding are advanced
to it by the Indemnitors.    8  14. Termination. This Escrow Agreement
shall be terminated (a) upon the disposition in accordance with this Escrow
Agreement of the entire amount of the Holdback and any proceeds from the
investment thereof or (b) by written mutual consent signed by the parties
hereto. This Escrow Agreement shall not otherwise be terminated. The
indemnification of Escrow Agent provided for in Section 13 shall survive the
termination of this Escrow Agreement and the resignation or removal of Escrow
Agent.   15. Miscellaneous.   (a) Notices. Any notice or other

or related to the Agreement whether in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Indiana, applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within the State of Indiana. Both parties consent to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of a federal or state court located in Marion County,
Indiana with respect to all disputes between the parties under or related to
the Agreement.   Section 6.4 Equitable Relief. The parties acknowledge that
there will be no adequate remedy at law for Licensee\'s failure to comply
with the terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, if Licensee fails to comply
with the terms of this Agreement, Licensor shall have the right to have any
breach of this Agreement (after taking into account any applicable cure
periods) remedied by equitable relief by way of a temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction, and such other
alternative relief as may be appropriate, without the requirement of posting
a bond or proving irreparable harm.   Section 6.5 Remedies Not Exclusive. No
remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall
be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder
or now or hereafter existing in law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.
The election of any one or more remedies shall not constitute a waiver of the
right to pursue other available remedies.   Section 6.6 Compliance With Law.
In respect of its obligations hereunder, each party covenants and warrants to
the other party that all such obligations shall be performed in compliance
with all material applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations. Each party shall obtain and maintain all material permits,
approvals and licenses necessary and appropriate to perform its obligations
hereunder and shall at all times comply with the terms and conditions of such
permits, approvals and licenses.   Section 6.7 Severability. If any term or
other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

hereto.   Section 6.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.    6   Section 6.11 Waiver. Failure of either party at any
time to require the performance of any provision under this Agreement shall
not affect the right of such party to require full performance thereafter and
a waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall
not be taken or held to be a waiver of any further or similar breach or as
nullifying the effectiveness of such provision.   Section 6.12 Assignment.

Licensee and may not by transferred or assigned in any manner (whether by
merger, sale of stock, sale of assets, reorganization, operation of law or

without the consent of Licensee to any person to whom the rights to the
Licensed Trademark are assigned, provided that assignee agrees to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement.   Section 6.13 Parties in Interest. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party

Agreement, express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other
