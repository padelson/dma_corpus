under the appropriate plans, receive credit under Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans
for their years of service with Seller. Seller will furnish to Buyer such
information in its personnel files as Buyer may reasonably request.

                  (b) Seller will pay, at or prior to the Closing, all unpaid
wages, salaries and bonuses, if any (together with all related payroll items),
of Seller's Employees accrued prior to the effective time of the Closing, and
all severance and other amounts, if any, which may become payable to or
receivable by Seller's Employees (by contract, as a matter of law or otherwise)
as a result of the termination of their employment with Seller (whether or not
such Seller's Employees are offered or accept employment with Buyer). Further,
Seller shall fully satisfy, as of the Closing Date, every Liability relating to
any Employee of Seller, including but not limited to vacation time or pay, sick
time or pay, or any other benefit accrued or owed to such Employees.

                  (c) Seller shall be responsible and liable to pay or make
provision for pension, profit sharing and welfare benefit amounts under any of
the Employee Plans payable or accrued prior to the effective time of the Closing
with respect to Seller's Employees. Buyer shall succeed to no rights of Seller
under any of the Employee Plans and shall neither assume nor incur any
Liability, including liability under ERISA, with respect to any of the Employee
Plans.

                  (d) Without limiting the generality of SECTION 2.6(c), Seller
shall pay or cause the applicable Employee Plan to pay, as the case may be, all
amounts payable in the form of health, dental, sick pay, disability, life
insurance or workers' compensation benefits, or otherwise, by reason of or in
connection with (i) any claims filed or expenses incurred at any time with
respect to injuries, disabilities, illnesses or conditions suffered by any of
Seller's Employees or their dependents prior to the effective time of the
Closing, (ii) any claims filed at any time with respect to the death of any of
Seller's Employees or their dependents prior to the Effective Time of the
Closing, or (iii) any claims subject to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), or any comparable state law
relating to continuation of such benefits filed at any time with respect to any
of Seller's Employees or other individuals entitled to such benefits as a result
of their relationship or former relationship with any of Seller's Employees who
had a



                                       11

<PAGE>


"qualifying event" as defined in COBRA prior to the Effective Time of the
Closing. Seller shall pay all such amounts when due (before or after the
effective time of the Closing) in accordance with the provisions of any such
Employee Plans and the prior practices of Seller. For purposes of this SECTION
2.6(d), an injury, disability, illness or condition shall be deemed to have been
"suffered" on the date of occurrence of the injury or on the date of onset of
the illness, disability or condition, as the case may be, and any disputes
concerning the date of such an occurrence or onset shall be resolved by
determination of a medical expert knowledgeable and qualified as to such matters
acceptable to both Seller and Buyer and confirmed by a medical certificate.

                  (e) Seller acknowledges that in making offers of employment to
any of Seller's Employees, Buyer is not assuming any of the Liability of Seller
to such Seller's Employees.

         SECTION 2.7 RELATED AGREEMENTS. At the Closing, the Parties will enter
into the following agreements (collectively, the "Related Agreements"):

                  (a) Employment Agreements between Buyer and the Employees of
Seller set forth on SCHEDULE 2.7(a), substantially in the form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT A;

                  (b) Assignment and Assumption of Lease in form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT B.

                  (c) Landlord Consent and Estoppel in the form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT C.

                  (d) Bills of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreements in
the forms attached hereto as EXHIBITS D and E, respectively.

                  (e) Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement in the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT F.

                  (f) A Closing Statement, including the Closing Date Statement
of Tangible Net Worth.

                  (g) Other transfer documents which shall be sufficient to vest
good and marketable title to the Acquired Assets and to transfer the Assumed
Liabilities in the name of Seller or its assignees.

                  (h) Such other agreements which further the performance of all
covenants and satisfy all conditions required of Selling Parties by this
Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, as Buyer or its counsel may reasonably
require.

         SECTION 2.8 NONASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated in this Agreement, if (i) the sale, assignment,
transfer or conveyance of any Contract Right without the approval, consent or
waiver of another party thereto would violate, conflict with, result in a breach
or termination of, or constitute a default or event of default under (or an
event which with due notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default or event of default under) the terms of such Contract giving rise to the
Contract Right or result in the creation of any Security Interest on any of the
Acquired Assets under such Contract or enable another party to such Contract to
terminate such Contract or impose a penalty or additional payment obligations or
accelerate any obligation of Seller or Buyer under such Contract, and (ii) all
necessary approvals, consents and waivers of all parties to such Contract have
not been obtained at or prior to the Closing, then (A) this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or assume such Contract Right and such
Contract Right shall not be assigned to or assumed by Buyer or included in the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, (B) Seller and Buyer shall,
following the Closing, use all reasonable efforts to assist the other in
attempting to obtain such necessary approvals, consents and waivers, (C) Seller
and Buyer shall, following the Closing, promptly execute all documents necessary
to complete the assignment and assumption of such Contract Right if such
approvals, consents and waivers are obtained, and (D) unless and until such
approvals, consents and waivers are obtained and such assignment and assumption
occurs, Seller and Buyer

                                       12

<PAGE>



shall cooperate in entering into any reasonable arrangement designed to obtain
for Buyer all benefits and privileges of such Contract Right including the
holding by Seller of such benefits and privileges in trust for Buyer) while
protecting Seller from the obligations of Seller first accruing after the
Closing Date under such Contract (in which event such benefits and privileges
will be deemed to be included in the Acquired Assets). Nothing stated in this
SECTION 2.8 shall affect the right of Buyer to elect not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the event the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE IX hereof are not satisfied in full at or before the Closing.

         SECTION 2.9. ASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS BY BUYER. Buyer
reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to satisfy warranty claims
arising from products or services of Seller sold or provided by Seller prior to
the Closing Date (the "WARRANTY CLAIMS"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Warranty Claims" shall mean claims to repair or replace products or services
sold or provided by Seller prior to the Closing Date and shall exclude any
claims for personal injuries or torts resulting from such products or services.
Buyer may deduct the amount for any costs of Warranty Claims from the Deferred
Amount and shall provide notice to Seller of same on a quarterly basis;
provided, however, that such amounts shall not be deducted from the Deferred
Amount unless and until such amounts exceed an aggregate of Twenty Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000) (the "WARRANTY THRESHOLD AMOUNT"); provided further, however,
that Buyer is entitled to deductions for Warranty Claims from the Warranty
Threshold Amount and then the Deferred Amount only if Buyer satisfies such
claims (i) by first attempting to repair or replace the subject product or
service to the extent reasonably practicable (in which case the amount of such
Warranty Claim shall be the actual cost to Buyer to repair or replace without
any markup) and (ii) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warranty
policies and procedures followed by Seller immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Subject to the Indemnification Limit, the Selling Parties shall be fully
liable for payment to Buyer of any amounts above the Warranty Threshold Amount
paid by Buyer for any Warranty Claims, which Buyer decides to satisfy. In the
event any Warranty Claims are asserted against Seller, then Seller shall give
prompt notice thereof to Buyer in order to permit Buyer the necessary time to
exercise its rights hereunder, evaluate the merits and defend, settle or
compromise such Warranty Claim. Buyer may only settle or compromise a single
Warranty Claim which exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000) with the prior
consent of the Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Within ten (10) days after the end of each month following the Closing, Buyer
shall provide an invoice to Seller for such excess over the Warranty Threshold
Amount. Such invoice will identify the product that is the basis of the Warranty
Claim, the date the product was sold, and the purchaser of the product and will
specify Warranty Claim payments, adjustments, returns, and replacements. Once
the Deferred Amount has been depleted, the Selling Parties shall pay such
invoices within 30 days. In the event a Warranty Claim is made to Buyer that
Buyer determines not to satisfy, Buyer shall provide notice to Seller of such
claim and will cooperate with Seller so that Seller can evaluate the claim and
determine how it should be satisfied.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                   THE CLOSING

         SECTION 3.1 THE CLOSING. The closing of the Contemplated Transactions
(the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Maslon Edelman Borman &
Brand, LLP in Minneapolis, Minnesota, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on
December ___, 2001, unless Buyer and Seller shall mutually determine a different
date (the "Closing Date"), provided all conditions to the closing contained
herein have been satisfied or waived in writing on or prior to the Closing Date.
Except as provided in ARTICLE XII, failure to consummate the purchase and sale
provided for in this Agreement on the date and time and at the place determined
pursuant to this SECTION 3.1 will not result in the termination of this
Agreement and will not relieve any Party of any obligation under this Agreement.
The Closing, if completed, will be effective for all purposes (including the
risk of loss to property and Buyer's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities) as
of the Effective Time.

         SECTION 3.2 DELIVERIES AT THE CLOSING. At the Closing, (i) the Selling
Parties will deliver to Buyer the various certificates, instruments, and
documents referred to in ARTICLE IX below and all other Related

                                       13

<PAGE>



Agreements; (ii) Buyer will deliver to Seller the various certificates,
instruments, and documents referred to in ARTICLE X below and all other Related
Agreements; (iii) the Selling Parties will execute, acknowledge (if
appropriate), and deliver to Buyer a general assignment and warranty bill of
sale (including all Intellectual Property transfer documents requested by Buyer)
and such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, and assignment in such
form as Buyer and its counsel reasonably may request; (iv) Buyer will execute,
acknowledge (if appropriate), and deliver to Seller an assumption agreement in
such form as Seller and its counsel reasonably may request; and (v) Buyer will
deliver to Seller the consideration in accordance with ARTICLE II above.

         SECTION 3.3 PRORATIONS.

                   (a) Property Taxes. All real estate Taxes and personal
property Taxes assessed against the Acquired Assets or, to the extent the Seller
is obligated to pay the same under the Real Property Leases, the Leased Real
Property, or any unpaid amounts assessed against the Acquired Assets or the Real
Property Leases in lieu thereof (collectively the "Property Taxes"), with
respect to the tax year (of the applicable taxing authority) in which the
Closing occurs shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer at the Closing, so
that Seller shall be responsible for that portion of such Property Taxes
determined by multiplying the full amount of such Property Taxes times a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such tax year
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in such tax year, and Buyer shall be responsible for the
remainder of such Property Taxes. In the event Property Tax statements are sent
directly to Seller, Seller shall cause such statements to be forwarded promptly
to Buyer. Seller shall also be responsible for all Property Taxes, including all
penalties and interest thereon, assessed by taxing authorities with respect to
any tax years prior to the tax year in which the Closing occurs and all
installments of special assessments assessed or pending prior to the Closing and
payable in any tax year (whether such tax year commences or ends before, on or
after the Closing Date) with respect to the Real Property Leases (in each case
to the extent the tenant is obligated to pay the same at any time under the Real
Property Leases).

                  (b) Agreements. Rent and other payments based on performance
over a period of time which are due and payable with respect to a period in
which the Closing occurs under the Real Property Leases or any other lease,
service agreement, maintenance agreement or similar contract included in the
Acquired Assets shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer at the Closing (based
on the number of days in such period occurring on or before and after the
Closing Date).

                  (c) Utilities. Seller and Buyer will use reasonable efforts so
that all providers of utility services to the Leased Real Property, to the
extent the tenant under the Real Property Leases is being billed directly
therefor, will bill Seller for all costs incurred on or prior to the Closing
Date and will bill Buyer for all costs incurred after the Closing Date. If the
providers do not submit separate bills, there will be such prorations at the
Closing respecting such utility costs as are equitable. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this SECTION 3.3(c), Seller shall be responsible
for all costs of utility services to the Leased Real Property, to the extent the
tenant under the Real Property Leases is billed directly therefor, incurred on
or prior to the Closing Date. Should the actual costs for such period be
different from the sum of the utility prorations made at the Closing, Seller
shall promptly reimburse Buyer, or Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any
overpayment made thereby, as appropriate.

                  (d) Transfer, Sales, Use Taxes. Except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, Seller shall pay all transfer (including real estate and
motor vehicle transfer), sales and use Taxes, if any, and all fees, costs, deed
Taxes and recording fees, if any, applicable to the sale and transfer of the
Real Property Leases and the other Acquired Assets to Buyer, regardless of
whether such fees and taxes are payable by Buyer under any state, local or
federal law, including, but not limited to bulk transfer laws. Each of the
parties shall cooperate with the other to the extent reasonably required and
permitted by any Legal Requirement in order to eliminate or minimize any such
Tax. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent any such Tax is imposed,
Seller shall


                                       14

<PAGE>


prepare and file any required Tax Returns in connection therewith and Seller
shall pay and promptly discharge when due the entire amount of any such Tax.

                  (e) Adjustments to Purchase Price. All Property Taxes,
charges, payments or costs the proration or apportionment of which is provided
for in this SECTION 3.3 that Seller is responsible for, as provided above,
shall, to the extent the same has not been paid by Seller at or prior to the
Closing, reduce the amount Buyer would otherwise be obligated to pay hereunder
in cash for the Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall thereafter be obligated to pay,
in a timely manner, such amounts to the appropriate authorities or other persons
to whom the same are due and owing when the same become due and owing. All
Property Taxes, charges, payments or costs the proration or apportionment of
which is provided for in this SECTION 3.3 that Buyer is responsible for, as
provided above, shall, to the extent the same has been paid by Seller at or
prior to the Closing, increase the amount Buyer would otherwise be obligated to
pay hereunder in cash for the Acquired Assets.

                                   ARTICLE IV
              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING PARTIES

         As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, each of the Selling Parties, jointly
and severally, represents and warrants to Buyer that the statements contained in
this Article IV are correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and as
of the Closing Date, except as set forth in that certain disclosure schedule
prepared by Seller and delivered to Buyer simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"). The Disclosure Schedule is arranged
in separate and distinct "schedules" corresponding to the lettered and numbered
sections contained in this ARTICLE IV; the disclosures set forth in one schedule
shall not be deemed to be a disclosure in any other schedule of the Disclosure
Schedule; and in no event shall the mere listing in any schedule of the
Disclosure Schedule hereto of a document or other item be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the
representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or other
item itself).

         SECTION 4.1 ORGANIZATION AND CAPITALIZATION OF SELLER. Seller is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Texas and has all requisite power and authority to carry on
its business as it is now, and has since its formation been, conducted and is
duly authorized to own the properties and assets it now owns. Seller is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary under the applicable law
as a result of the conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties
except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not have
a Material Adverse Effect. All of the Seller's shareholders are listed on
SCHEDULE 4.1 of the Disclosure Schedule. There are no outstanding or authorized
options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights, exchange rights or
other Contracts or commitments that require Seller to issue, sell or otherwise
cause to become outstanding any of its shares or other interests. All of the
issued and outstanding shares and other ownership or equity interests or rights
are owned of record and beneficially by Seller's shareholders.

         SECTION 4.2 AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTION. Seller has full power and
authority (including full partnership power and authority) to execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and the Related Agreements and to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions. Seller's shareholders have duly authorized the
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions by Seller. This Agreement constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of each of the Selling Parties, enforceable in
accordance with its terms and conditions.

         SECTION 4.3 NO CONFLICT. Neither the execution and the delivery of this
Agreement or the Related Agreements, nor the consummation or performance of any
of the Contemplated Transactions will, directly or indirectly (with or without
notice or lapse of time): (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of or default under (a) any provision of the articles of incorporation
or by-laws of the Seller or (b) any resolution adopted by any of Seller's
shareholders or directors; (ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of or default under, or give any Governmental Body or other Person the
right to challenge any of the Contemplated Transactions or to exercise any
remedy or obtain any relief under, any Legal Requirement or any Order to which
any of the Selling Parties or any of the Acquired Assets is subject; (iii)
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation of or default under any of
the terms or requirements of, or give any Governmental Body the right to revoke,
withdraw, suspend, cancel, terminate, or modify, any Governmental Authorization
that is held by Seller or that otherwise relates to the Business; or (iv)
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of or default
under any provision of, or give any Person the right to declare a default or
exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or
to cancel, terminate, or modify, any Contract or other arrangement to which
Seller is a party or by which Seller is bound or to which any of the Acquired
Assets is subject (or result in the imposition of any Security Interest upon any
of the Acquired Assets), except for, as to any of the matters covered by clauses
(ii), (iii) or (iv) above, such conflicts, violations or breaches which could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material


                                       16

<PAGE>


Adverse Effect. Seller is not and will not be required to give any notice to or
obtain any consent from any Person in order for the Parties to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions.

         SECTION 4.4 BROKERS' FEES. Neither Seller nor any of Seller's
Shareholders has any Liability or obligation to pay any fees or commissions to
any broker, finder, or agent with respect to the Contemplated Transactions.

         SECTION 4.5 CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS. No litigation or proceeding is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against or related to Seller, that
challenges or could reasonably be expected to have the effect of delaying,
making illegal, or otherwise preventing or hindering any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

         SECTION 4.6 TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
4.6:

                  (a) Seller has good title to each item of Tangible Personal
Property and each item of the Acquired Assets owned by it free and clear of any
and all Security Interests;

                  (b) Each item of Tangible Personal Property not owned by
Seller is in such condition that upon the return of such property to its owner
in its present condition at the end of the relevant lease term or as otherwise
contemplated by the applicable agreement between Seller and the owner or lessor
thereof, the obligations of Seller to such owner or lessor will be discharged;

                  (c) The Tangible Personal Property owned or used by Seller is
sufficient for the proper conduct of its business as heretofore conducted;

                  (d) Seller has maintained the Tangible Personal Property owned
or leased by it in a manner consistent with the ongoing requirements of the
Business and has not altered such maintenance practices in anticipation of the
Contemplated Transactions;

                  (e) Seller owns or otherwise has the right to use all of the
Tangible Personal Property currently in the operation of the business;

                  (f) All of the Tangible Personal Property is free from defects
and is in good operating condition and repair (subject to normal wear and tear);
and

                  (g) Seller has no Contract, letter of intent or proposal
relating to the acquisition or divestiture of any Tangible Personal Property.

         SECTION 4.7 AFFILIATES. Each of Starlink, Incorporated and Starlink
Special Assets, Inc. have no other Affiliates except the Shareholders and do not
own, directly or indirectly, any shares of the capital stock or other equity
interests of any other Person.

         SECTION 4.8 TAX STATEMENTS. SCHEDULE 4.8(a) contains the federal income
tax returns of Seller as of December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and any related
consolidated statements of earnings, equity and cash flows for the fiscal years
then ended which Seller has prepared related thereto (the "TAX STATEMENTS").

of each calendar month preceding Closing. The September 30, 2001 financial

including the Statement of Tangible Net Worth, shall collectively be referred to
as the "INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS". The Tax Statements and, subject to the
exceptions hereinafter set forth in this SECTION 4.8, the Interim Financial
Statements (i) were prepared in accordance with the books and records of Seller;
(ii) were prepared in a fair and accurate manner to reflect the


                                       17

Adverse Effect): Interim Financial Statements (i) are subject to normal
recurring year-end adjustments, and (ii) do not contain all footnote disclosures
required by GAAP.

         SECTION 4.9 EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET. Except as set forth

         SECTION 4.11 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Seller,
and the conduct of the Business and ownership and use of the Acquired Assets,
are in material compliance with all Legal Requirements. None of the Selling
Parties has received during the past five years any written notice to the effect
that, or to the knowledge of each of the Selling Parties, otherwise been advised
by a Governmental Body, that, Seller is not in compliance with any Legal
Requirement. Seller has all Governmental Authorizations and approvals, each of
which is currently valid and in full force and effect, material to the conduct
of the Business, all of which Governmental Authorizations and approvals are set
forth in SCHEDULE 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule. Without limiting the
generality of the preceding representation and warranty, Seller has not (i) made
or agreed to make any contribution, payment or gift to any government official,
Employee, or agent where either the contribution, payment or gift or the purpose

generally describes:

                           (1) each Employee Benefit Plan that is maintained or
contributed to by Seller or the Shareholders for the benefit of Seller's
Employees; and each trust fund maintained by Seller or the Shareholders in
connection with any of such Employee Benefit Plans; and

                           (2) all other plans providing compensation (other

Code. The Employee Benefit Plans, the Compensation Plans and any 125 Plan may be
collectively referred to as the "EMPLOYEE PLANS."

                  (b) The Selling Parties have furnished to Buyer a true,
correct and complete copy of each of the Employee Benefit Plans and any related
trust agreements or other funding vehicles; true, correct and complete copies of
the Compensation Plans and 125 Plan (or summaries of any unwritten Compensation
Plans or 125 Plan) and true, correct and complete copies of any employment
policy manuals distributed to any class of Employees of Seller. With respect to
each of the Employee Benefit Plans and any 125 Plan, the Selling Parties have
also furnished to Buyer the most recent summary plan description and the last
three most recently filed annual reports required to be made on Form 5500. As to
each of the Employee Benefit Plans that is funded, Seller has delivered or made

qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) (a "QUALIFIED PLAN"). With respect to
each Qualified Plan, the following are true: (a) the plan, in form and
operation, currently satisfies, and for all years subsequent to the
establishment of such plan, has satisfied, the qualification requirements of
Section 401(a) of the Code; and (b) the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") has
issued a


                                       26

limitation the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and related
regulations), and all amendments required by the Code as a condition of
retention of such qualified status as of the date hereof have been adopted
within time limits required to maintain such status or such time limits have not
expired. Each of the Qualified Plans is and has been operating in compliance
with all amendments required by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent
legislation and regulations. Seller has furnished to Buyer a true, correct and
complete copy of the most recent letter of determination issued with respect to
each such Qualified Plan.

contributed to or been required to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan, (ii) no
amount is due by Seller to any Multiemployer Plan on account of any withdrawal
therefrom, (iii) no withdrawal events triggering liability have occurred with
respect to any Multiemployer Plan (and no material risk of such event exists),

respect of an asset sale by Seller or any ERISA Affiliate made in the prior five
(5) years, and (v) SCHEDULE 4.26(d), lists and described the current liability
of Seller under each Multiemployer Plan if a withdrawal liability occurred on
the date of this Agreement.

                  (e) Seller has not engaged in, nor entered into any
arrangement pursuant to which Seller is contractually bound to enter into, any
transaction which could result in imposition upon Seller, Buyer or Buyer's
subsidiaries, of any excise tax under Sections 4971 through 4980B, inclusive,
and Section 5000 of the Code or civil liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l)
of ERISA or otherwise incurred a liability for any excise tax with respect to
any of the Employee Plans, other than excise taxes that have heretofore been
paid or have been accrued, and, in either case are fully reflected in the
Balance Sheet.

                  (f) Seller has (a) filed or caused to be filed on a timely
basis each and every return, report, statement, notice, declaration and other

local (including, without limitation, the IRS, the Department of Labor, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the SEC) with respect to each of the

group of corporations, an unincorporated trade or business under common control,
or a member of an affiliated service group (as such terms are defined in
Sections 414(b), 414(c) and 414(m) of the Code), that includes any entity other
than Seller.

                  (h) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.26(h) hereto, Seller has
not utilized to any material extent, the services of "leased employees" (as
defined in Section 414(n) of the Code) within the four (4) year period ending on
the Closing Date, nor are there any persons now working for Seller who are
anticipated to become such leased employees with the passage of time, except to
the extent such status would not have a Material Adverse Effect on any of the
Employee Plans.

                  (i) Except as described in SCHEDULE 4.26(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule, Seller does not maintain any group life insurance or health benefit
coverage for former Employees or directors of Seller, other


                                       27
<PAGE>

than group life insurance or health benefit coverage mandated by applicable law.
Seller has timely complied with all of its "COBRA" obligations under ERISA
Section 602, Code Section 4980B and applicable state insurance laws, with
respect to group life insurance or health benefit continuation coverage to be
provided by those of its Employee Plans that provide such benefits.

                  (j) With respect to the Employee Plans, there are no claims,
actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of each of the
Selling Parties, threatened against Seller or any other fiduciaries thereof,
respecting their duties or obligations to any such plan, its assets, any trust
thereunder or any participant or beneficiary thereof, except claims made in the
ordinary course for benefits or compensation provided by such plans.

                  (k) Neither Seller, nor any of its directors, partners,
officers, Employees or other "fiduciaries," as that term is defined in Section
3(21) of ERISA, has committed any breach of fiduciary responsibility imposed by
ERISA or any other applicable law with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans,
that would subject Seller, Buyer, Buyer's subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers or Employees to any liability under ERISA or any
other applicable law and that is reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 4.27 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS; HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

                  (a) Seller is, and at all times has been, in full compliance
with, and has not been and is not in violation of or liable under, any

                  (c) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened claims, investigations, proceedings, encumbrances or other

Laws, no environmental condition exists on any of the Leased Real Property that
either (A) requires the owner of such Leased Real Property to report such
condition to any Governmental Body or (B) requires the owner of such Leased Real
Property to make a notation of such condition in any public records or
conveyancing instrument upon the conveyance of any of such Leased Real Property.

all such Losses including the Threshold Amount. The Selling Parties' aggregate
liability under the provisions of this ARTICLE XI shall not exceed the amount of
Five Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($5,500,000) (the "INDEMNIFICATION
LIMIT"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the maximum individual liability of each Shareholder under
this SECTION 11.1 shall not exceed the product resulting from multiplying (i)
the Indemnification Limit by (ii) such Shareholder's percentage share of the
outstanding capital stock of Starlink, Incorporated as of the Effective Date.

                  (c) Limitation on Indemnification. The right to
indemnification under SECTION 11.1 shall terminate on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the right to indemnity and the
obligation for indemnification shall have no limit as to time or amount for the
following: (i) for any pending claim for indemnity hereunder which shall have
been made prior to such termination date, such claim shall not terminate until
the final determination and satisfaction of such claim; (ii) claims for
indemnification based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Seller or
the Shareholders or intentional breach of this Agreement or the Related
Agreements; (iii) claims for indemnification based upon breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or the Shareholders pertaining to
unencumbered title to the Acquired Assets, Taxes or the Employee Plans; or (iv)
claims for indemnification pursuant to paragraph (4) of SECTION 11.1(a).

                  (d) Third-Party Claims.

                           (1) Procedures. In the event any demands or claims
are asserted against a Buyer Indemnified Party or any actions, suits or
proceedings are commenced against a Buyer Indemnified Party for which the
Selling Parties are obligated to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party under this
SECTION 11.1, then the Buyer Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice thereof
to Seller in order to permit the Selling Parties the necessary time to evaluate
the merits of such demand, claim, action, suit or proceeding and defend, settle
or compromise the same so that the Selling Parties' interests are not materially
prejudiced. Within thirty (30) calendar days after such notice, either the
Selling Parties shall give written notice of their objection to such claim, in
which event such dispute will be settled pursuant to SECTION 13.10 of this
Agreement, or the Selling Parties shall assume the defense thereof by written
notice to the Buyer Indemnified Party with counsel chosen by the Selling Parties
and reasonably acceptable to the Buyer Indemnified Party. The Selling Parties
shall not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred by a Buyer Indemnified
Party in connection with any demand, claim, action, suit or proceeding for which
the Selling Parties are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Party under
this SECTION 11.1, provided that the Selling Parties shall have assumed the
defense thereof in accordance with this SECTION 11.1. The Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to participate in (but not


                                       41
<PAGE>

control) the defense of any such action, with its counsel and at its own
expense. If the Selling Parties do not assume the defense of any such claim or
litigation resulting therefrom in a timely fashion or shall not diligently
pursue such defense in the reasonable opinion of such Buyer Indemnified Party,
(a) a Buyer Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation, in
such manner as it may deem appropriate, at the Selling Parties' expense,
including, but not limited to, settling such claim or litigation, after giving
notice of the same to Seller, on such terms as such Buyer Indemnified Party may
deem appropriate, and (b) the Selling Parties shall be entitled to participate
in (but not control) the defense of such action, with their own counsel and at
their own expense. If the Selling Parties elect to assume the defense of any
such third-party claim, the Selling Parties shall conclusively be deemed to have
acknowledged their obligations under this SECTION 11.1 to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in accordance with the terms hereof in respect of such claim
and shall be obligated to take all steps necessary in the diligent defense or
settlement of such claim.

                           (2) Settlement and Compromise. The Selling Parties
shall not settle or compromise any demands, claims, actions, suits or
proceedings for which a Buyer Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from
the Selling Parties unless they shall have given the Buyer Indemnified Party not
less than 15 days prior written notice of the proposed settlement or compromise
and afforded the Buyer Indemnified Party an opportunity to consult with the
Selling Parties regarding the proposed settlement or compromise. Such notice
shall contain a copy of all documents related to the proposed settlement or
compromise.

                           (3) Special Claims. Notwithstanding SECTIONS
11.1(d)(1) and 11.1(d)(2), the following claims will be subject to the
provisions of this SECTION 11.1(d)(3): any claims which Buyer determines in its
reasonable discretion would likely have a significant effect on the ongoing
business, operations, or condition (financial or otherwise) of Buyer or its
Affiliates, including but not limited to (a) government regulation on an ongoing
basis, including employment matters, working conditions and environmental
matters, (b) relations with major suppliers and customers, (c) product liability
claims and (d) injunctive or other equitable relief (collectively the "SPECIAL
CLAIMS"). No Special Claim shall be settled without Buyer's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such consent shall
not be deemed to be unreasonably withheld if such settlement would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer's ongoing business. In the event Buyer is not
willing to provide its consent to a settlement pursuant to which the Selling
Parties and the claimant are willing to completely settle the claim for a fixed
amount of money, the Selling Parties' indemnification obligation pursuant to
SECTION 11.1 shall be satisfied by the payment of such fixed amount contained in
such settlement documents.

                  (e) Independent Claims. In the event that a Buyer Indemnified
Party believes it is entitled to indemnification under this SECTION 11.1 by the
Selling Parties and such Loss does not involve a third-party as contemplated by
SECTION 11.1(D) above, then such Buyer Indemnified Party shall give prompt
notice thereof to the Selling Parties in order to permit the Selling Parties
time to evaluate the merits of such demand. If the Buyer has not received
written notice of an objection to the payment of such amounts from the Selling
Parties (a copy of which shall be sent by the Selling Parties to each Buyer
Indemnified Party disclosed on the original notice) within thirty (30) calendar
days after receipt of the Buyer Indemnified Party's notice, Buyer Indemnified
Party or Parties may deduct such Loss from the Deferred Amount or, if the
Deferred Amount has been depleted, the Selling Parties shall pay such Buyer
Indemnified Party or Parties such amounts demanded. If the Selling Parties
object to such indemnification demand within the 30 day period set forth herein,
such dispute shall be settled pursuant to SECTION 13.10 of this Agreement.

                  (f) Manner of Indemnification. All indemnification by the
Selling Parties after the Deferred Amount has been depleted shall be effected by
the payment of cash or delivery of a certified or official bank check within ten
(10) days of the resolution of any such claim. Any and all indemnification
payments shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

                  (g) Non-Waiver. Failure of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to
give reasonably prompt


                                       42
<PAGE>

notice of any claim or claims shall not release, waive or otherwise affect any
of the Selling Parties' obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the Selling Parties can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result
of such failure.

                  (h) Nonexclusive Remedy. The indemnification provisions
contained in this Section 11.1 are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any
statutory, common law or equitable rights or remedies any party may have for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

         SECTION 11.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER.

                  (a) Generally. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless

                           (6) all liabilities and obligations of Buyer for
Taxes, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement;

                           (7) any and all Losses directly or indirectly
resulting or arising from any claims (including product liability, auto
liability and general liability claims) in respect of products sold or services
provided by Buyer prior to, on or after the Closing;

                           (8) (A) the Release, emission, discharge, storage,
generation, transportation, treatment, placement or disposal of Hazardous
Materials or threatened Release, emission or discharge of Hazardous Materials
after the Closing (xx) by Buyer or any Person which is a successor to Buyer,
directly or indirectly (such Person shall be referred to in this SECTION 11.2 as
"SUCCESSOR") or (yy) on, under or near the Leased Real Property or any property
previously owned, leased or used by Seller or any Successor (for purposes of
this SECTION 11.2 all such real property shall be collectively referred to as
the "INDEMNIFIED REAL PROPERTY"); (B) the violation by Buyer or any Predecessor
of any Environmental Law; or (C) the failure of



                                       43
<PAGE>

any Indemnified Real Property to comply with any Environmental Law following the
Closing; in each case regardless of whether such matter constitutes a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or is
disclosed in any schedule to this Agreement; and for the purpose of this
Section, Losses shall include, without limitation, investigatory costs, Clean-up
costs, monitoring costs, governmental response costs, natural resource damages,
property damages, Liability for nuisance or damage to property values, personal
injuries and penalties; and

                           (9) (A) operation or condition of the Business
following the Closing, (B) ownership, condition or control of the Acquired
Assets following the Closing Date, (C) incidents, conditions, occurrences or
omissions related to Buyer or a Successor, the Leased Real Property, the
Acquired Assets or the Business commencing or in existence following the
Closing, (D) any and all Losses directly or indirectly resulting or arising from
the occupancy or condition of the Leased Real Property following the Closing, or
incidents, occurrences or conditions relating thereto, and (E) any and all
Losses relating to the Assumed Liabilities.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no SP Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent any Loss is
caused by a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation of any Selling Party under this Agreement or the Related Agreements.

                  (b) Deductible and Limitation Amount. No claim for
indemnification under Sections 11.2(a)(1) through 11.2(a)(3) shall be made by an
SP Indemnified Party unless and until the aggregate amount of such claims by all
SP Indemnified Parties shall exceed Eighty Thousand Dollars ($80,000) (the
"THRESHOLD Amount"), and when the Threshold Amount is reached the Buyer shall be
liable for all such Losses including the Threshold Amount. Buyer's aggregate
liability under such provisions of this SECTION 11.2 shall not exceed the
Indemnification Limit.

                  (c) Limitation on Indemnification. The right to
indemnification under Section 11.2 shall terminate on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the right to indemnity and the
obligation for indemnification shall have no limit as to time or amount for the
following: (i) for any pending claim for indemnity hereunder which shall have
been made prior to such termination date, such claim shall not terminate until
the final determination and satisfaction of such claim; (ii) claims for
indemnification based upon fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Buyer or
intentional breach of this Agreement or the Related Agreements or (iii) claims
for indemnification pursuant to paragraph (4) of SECTION 11.2(a).

                  (d) Third-Party Claims.

                           (1) Procedures. In the event any demands or claims
are asserted against the SP Indemnified Parties or any actions, suits or
proceedings are commenced against any SP Indemnified Party for which Buyer is
obligated to indemnify a SP Indemnified Party under this Section 11.2, then the
SP Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice thereof to Buyer in order to
permit Buyer the necessary time to evaluate the merits of such demand, claim,
action, suit or proceeding and defend, settle or compromise the same so that
Buyer's interest is not materially prejudiced. Within 30 calendar days after
such notice, Buyer shall assume the defense thereof by written notice to the
Selling Parties with counsel chosen by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the SP
Indemnified Party. Buyer shall not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred
by the SP Indemnified Party in connection with any demand, claim, action, suit
or proceeding for which Buyer is obligated to indemnify the SP Indemnified Party
under this Section 11.2, provided that Buyer shall have assumed the defense
thereof in accordance with this Section 11.2. The SP Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action,
with its counsel and at its own expense. If the Buyer does not assumes the
defense of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom in a timely fashion,
(a) the SP Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation, in
such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling
such claim or litigation, after giving notice of the same to Buyer on such terms
as the SP Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, and (b) Buyer shall be
entitled to



                                       44

participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with their own
counsel and at its own expense.

                           (2) Settlement and Compromise. Buyer shall not settle
or compromise any demands, claims, actions, suits or proceedings for which the
SP Indemnified Parties have sought indemnification from Buyer unless it shall
have given the SP Indemnified Parties not less than 15 days prior written notice
of the proposed settlement or compromise and afforded the SP Indemnified Parties
an opportunity to consult with Buyer regarding the proposed settlement or
compromise. Such notice shall contain a copy of all documents related to the
proposed settlement or compromise.

                  (e) Independent Claims. In the event that an SP Indemnified
Party believes it is entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.2 by the
Buyer and such Loss does not involve a third-party as contemplated by Section
11.2(d) above, then such SP Indemnified Party shall give prompt notice thereof
to the Buyer in order to permit the Buyer time to evaluate the merits of such
demand. Within thirty (30) calendar days after such notice, the Buyer shall pay
such SP Indemnified Party or Parties such amounts demanded or object to such
demand by delivering written notice thereof to Seller or to each SP Indemnified
Party disclosed on the original notice. If the Buyer objects to such demand
within the 30 day period set forth herein, such dispute shall be settled
pursuant to Section 13.10 of this Agreement.

                  (f) Manner of Indemnification. All indemnification by the

Any and all indemnification payments shall be deemed an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

                  (g) Non-Waiver. Failure of the SP Indemnified Parties to give
reasonably prompt notice of any claim or claims shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect any of the Buyer's obligations with respect thereto except to
the extent that the Buyer can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result
of such failure.

                  (h) Nonexclusive Remedy. The indemnification provisions
contained in this Section 11.2 are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any
statutory, common law or equitable rights or remedies any party may have for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

         SECTION 11.3 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date.

condition set forth in Article X to be satisfied on or prior to the Closing

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

will use its Best Efforts to seek the consent and approval of the other Parties
as to the form and substance of the disclosure prior to making such disclosure;

Any Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim, or other communication
hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth above using any
other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier, messenger service,
telefax, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic mail), but no such notice, request,
demand, claim,


                                       48
<PAGE>

or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given
unless given in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 13.7, or
unless and until it actually is received by the intended recipient. Any Party
may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving each other Party notice
in the manner herein set forth.

         SECTION 13.8 RECORDING WITHOUT CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. This Agreement
shall not be recorded in the public records of any governmental entity without
the written consent of Buyer and Seller, except as may be required by law.

         SECTION 13.9 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of South Dakota
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction).

         SECTION 13.10 DISPUTE RESOLUTION. All disputes arising under this
Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the commercial rules of
the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect before a single
arbitrator. The arbitrator must be a retired judge of a state or federal court
of the United States or a licensed lawyer with at least ten (10) years of
corporate or commercial law experience from a law firm with at least 10
attorneys and at least an AV rating by Martindale Hubbell. A list of ten (10)
potential arbitrators shall be obtained from the AAA. Each party to the dispute
shall rank the potential arbitrators from one to ten with ten being the most
desirable. The arbitrator who receives the most points shall be the arbitrator
for such dispute. If there is a tie, a random drawing shall be held and the
first arbitrator chosen shall be the arbitrator for such dispute. All disputes
shall be arbitrated in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The award rendered by the
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof.

                  (a) Each party shall have discovery rights as provided by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure within the limits imposed by the arbitrator;
provided, however, that all such discovery shall be commenced and concluded
within ninety (90) days of the selection of the arbitrator.

                  (b) It is the intent of the parties that any arbitration shall
be concluded as quickly as reasonably practicable. Unless the parties otherwise
agree, once commenced, the hearing on the disputed matters shall be held four
days a week until concluded, with each hearing date to begin at 9:00 a.m. and to
conclude at 5:00 p.m. The arbitrator shall use all reasonable efforts to issue
the final award or awards within a period of five (5) business days after
closure of the proceedings. Failure of the arbitrator to meet the time limits of
this Section shall not be a basis for challenging the award.

                  (c) The arbitrator shall instruct the non-prevailing parties
to pay and the non-prevailing party shall pay all costs of the proceedings,
including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses of the prevailing parties. If the arbitrator determine that
there is not a prevailing party, each party shall be instructed to bear its own
costs and to pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators.

                  (d) Nothing contained herein shall bar any party hereto from
seeking equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

         SECTION 13.11 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment of any provision of
this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation,
or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall
be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising
by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

         SECTION 13.12 SEVERABILITY. If any provision or portion thereof of this
Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future law in any jurisdiction, (a) such provision or portion thereof will be
fully severable in such jurisdiction, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or portion
thereof had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or portion thereof or by its
severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or portion thereof, there will be added automatically as a part of
this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible to the
maximum extent allowable by law.

         SECTION 13.13 EXPENSES. Buyer, Seller and Shareholders shall bear their
own costs and expenses (including legal and accounting fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions,
except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

         SECTION 13.14 CONSTRUCTION. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or
foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. As
used herein, the word "including" has the same meaning as "including without
limitation," and the auxiliary verbs "will" and "shall" are used interchangeably
to express determination, compulsion, obligation, and necessity. Nothing in the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein unless the Disclosure Schedule identifies
the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in
reasonable detail. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels
of specificity) which the Party has not breached shall not detract from or
mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, or covenant.

         SECTION 13.15 INCORPORATION OF EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES. The Exhibits and
Schedules identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and
made a part hereof.

         SECTION 13.16 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed substantially in
accordance with their specific terms. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees
that the other Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent material breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the substantial performance of this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United States or
any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

         SECTION 13.17 FORUM. Subject to Section 13.10, any action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based upon any right arising out of,
this Agreement may be brought against any of the Parties in the district courts
of the State of South Dakota (sitting at Sioux Falls, South Dakota) or, if it
has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court, and each
of the Parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and the appropriate
appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to
venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the
preceding sentence may be served on any Party anywhere in the world in any
manner authorized by law. The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

         SECTION 13.18 FURTHER ASSURANCES. If, at any time after the Closing
Date, any party shall consider or be advised that any further assignments,
conveyances, certificates, filings, instruments or documents or any other things
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm in Buyer title to the
Acquired Assets, or to consummate any of the Contemplated Transactions, the
appropriate other party(ies) shall, upon request, promptly execute and deliver
all such proper deeds, assignments, certificates, filings, instruments and
documents and do all things reasonably necessary and proper to vest, perfect or
confirm title to the Acquired Assets in Buyer and to otherwise carry out the
purpose of this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.19 SETOFF. If any of the Selling Parties fails to pay any
amounts it or they owe Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement or any other agreement (oral or written) between any of such parties,
Buyer shall have the right to offset such amounts which have not been paid
against all amounts which are owed by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to any of
the Selling Parties pursuant to any and all obligations.

         SECTION 13.20 FACSIMILE EXECUTION. This Agreement may be executed by
one or more of the parties by facsimile transmitted signature and all parties
agree that the reproduction of signatures by way of telecopying device will be
treated as though such reproductions were executed originals.
