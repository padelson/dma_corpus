Net Working Capital, Aggregate Permitted Acquisition Price Amount and Transaction Expenses contained herein and the provisions
of this Agreement, (y)&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;written presentation submitted by each of the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer

that no Party (or any of its Affiliates, advisors or representatives) shall engage in any <I>ex parte</I> communications with the
Valuation Firm. The Valuation Firm shall determine, based solely on the presentations and responses submitted by the Equityholder
Representative and the Buyer, and not by independent review, only those issues set forth in the Dispute Notice (and those raised
by the Buyer in response thereto) that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such disputed item which is equal
to or between the final values proposed by the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative in their respective submissions. The Parties
shall request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with respect to all remaining disputed items in the Dispute Notice within
thirty (30) days after the submissions of the Parties, as provided above, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The final
determination with respect to all disputed items in the Dispute Notice submitted to the Valuation Firm shall be set forth in a
written statement by the Valuation Firm delivered to the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer and shall be final, conclusive
and binding on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Valuation Firm
in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the
Valuation Firm incurred pursuant to this <FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><B><U>&lrm;</U></B></FONT><U>Section&nbsp;3.5(b)</U>&nbsp;shall
be borne by Equityholder Representative, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the final
allocation made by such Valuation Firm of any disputed items in the Dispute Notice submitted to the Valuation Firm such that the
prevailing Party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if the Equityholder Representative claims
that the appropriate adjustments are one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount determined by the Buyer and if the Valuation
Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the Equityholder Representative seven hundred dollars ($700) of the one thousand
dollars ($1,000) disputed, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated seventy percent (70%) (i.e.,
700 <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&divide;</FONT> 1,000) to the Buyer and thirty percent (30%) (i.e.,
300 <FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&divide;</FONT> 1,000) to the Equityholder Representative.</P>

the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement or Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) (as applicable)
are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, and no withdrawal, termination,
amendment or modification is contemplated by any party thereto. Each of the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement and

Contracts or agreements (including this Agreement) among the Buyer and the Company or the Company&rsquo;s Equityholders and will

nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;13.9</U> shall limit any right to specifically enforce this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;13.11</U>.

the Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder Representative further intend and understand such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable against the Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder Representative and each of their respective Affiliates and
Persons that they have the authority to bind under applicable Law. To the extent that the Company, any Blocker or the Equityholder
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates or Persons that they have the authority to bind commences any Proceeding
against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to
the Buyer or its representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Buyer or its representatives,
the Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder Representative hereby acknowledge and agree that their respective and their respective
Affiliates&rsquo; sole remedy shall be against assets of the Buyer not in the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit
the Company, any Blocker or the Equityholder Representative or such Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any of their behalves)
to have any claim against the Trust Account (including the Trust Distributions) or any amounts contained in the Trust Account
while in the Trust Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;13.9 </U>shall serve to limit or prohibit
(i)&nbsp;the Company&rsquo;s, each Blocker&rsquo;s, any Company Unitholder&rsquo;s, any Company Optionholder&rsquo;s or the Equityholder
Representative&rsquo;s right to pursue a claim against the Buyer for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust Account
or pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;13.11</U> for specific performance or other non-monetary relief, or (ii)&nbsp;any claims that the
Company, any Blocker, any Company Unitholder, any Company Optionholder or the Equityholder Representative may have in the future

from the Trust Account (other than the Trust Distributions) and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such
funds) other than as contemplated by this Agreement,.</P>

are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions hereof are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching Party would have
no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees that each
other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to enforce specifically this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement to the extent expressly contemplated herein or therein and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding,
in addition to any other remedy to which such Person may be entitled. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree

hereof in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;13.11</U> shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection

the Equityholder Representative from and against any loss incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined

is intended to measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer for such Taxable

of any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered to be subject to the rules&nbsp;of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations or the appropriate provisions of United States state and local income and franchise Tax law, as applicable,
governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any
Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax Attribute (&ldquo;<B><U>TRA Portion</U></B>&rdquo;) and another portion
that is not (&ldquo;<B><U>Non-TRA Portion</U></B>&rdquo;), such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with the

in respect of (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;the Purchase and (ii)&nbsp;Blocker NOLs (in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law and

Assets for the Corporate Taxpayer in the Taxable Year of payment, (B)&nbsp;as a result, such additional Purchase Basis Adjustments
and Exchange Basis Adjustments shall be incorporated into the calculation for the Taxable Year of the applicable payment and into
the calculations for subsequent Taxable Years, as appropriate, (C)&nbsp;the Actual Tax Liability shall take into account the deduction
of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under applicable law, and (D)&nbsp;the
liability for U.S. federal income Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer and the amount of taxable income of the Corporate Taxpayer for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes as determined for purposes of calculating the Actual Tax Liability and the Hypothetical Tax Liability
shall include, without duplication, such liability for U.S. federal income Taxes and such U.S. federal taxable income that is economically

Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(b)</U>, and any Early Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall also (x)&nbsp;deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and work papers, as determined by the
Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that
were relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule, and (y)&nbsp;&nbsp;allow the TRA Party Representative and its advisors reasonable
access to the appropriate representatives of the Corporate Taxpayer, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested
by the TRA Party Representative. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure
that any Tax Benefit Schedule or Early Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along with any supporting schedules
and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability and the Hypothetical
Tax Liability and identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes of such
calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days
from the date on which all relevant TRA Parties have been given the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under <U>Section&nbsp;7.1,</U>
unless the TRA Party Representative (i)&nbsp;within thirty (30) calendar days from such date gives the Corporate Taxpayer written
notice of a material objection to such Schedule or amendment thereto made in good faith (&ldquo;<B><U>Objection Notice</U></B>&rdquo;),
or (ii)&nbsp;provides a written waiver of its right to give an Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i)&nbsp;above,
in which case such Schedule or amendment thereto shall become binding on the date such waiver is received by the Corporate Taxpayer.
If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised
in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of such Objection Notice, the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures described in <U>Section&nbsp;7.9</U>
(the &ldquo;<B><U>Reconciliation Procedures</U></B>&rdquo;), in which case such Schedule or Amended Schedule shall become binding
in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;7.9</U>. The TRA Party Representative will represent the interests of each of the TRA Parties
and shall raise and pursue, in accordance with this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(a)</U>, any objection to a Schedule or amendment thereto
timely given in writing to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.</FONT></P>

Schedule</U>. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i)&nbsp;in
connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii)&nbsp;to correct material inaccuracies in the Schedule, including
those identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the date the Schedule
was provided to a TRA Party, (iii)&nbsp;to comply with an Expert&rsquo;s determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv)&nbsp;to
reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or
carryforward of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v)&nbsp;to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the
Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi)&nbsp;to
adjust an applicable TRA Party&rsquo;s Basis Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement (any such
Schedule, an &ldquo;<B><U>Amended Schedule</U></B>&rdquo;). If applicable, the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule
to each TRA Party when the Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis Schedule for the following Taxable Year. In the event a Schedule
is amended after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3(a)</U>&nbsp;or, if applicable, <U>Section&nbsp;7.9</U>,
(A)&nbsp;the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into account in calculating any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which
the amendment relates but instead shall be taken into account in calculating the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for the Taxable
Year in which the amendment actually occurs, and (B)&nbsp;as a result of the foregoing, any increase of the Net Tax Benefit attributable
to an Amended Schedule shall not accrue the Interest Amount (or any other interest hereunder) until after the due date (without
extensions) for filing IRS Form&nbsp;1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to Taxes for the Taxable
Year in which the amendment actually occurs.</FONT></P>

disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Expert) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so submitted,

collect amounts due under the preceding sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning
of this <U>Section&nbsp;7.9</U> shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and
the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;7.9</U> shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of

The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this TRA Agreement such amounts
as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision
of state, local, foreign or other Tax law; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Corporate Taxpayer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify and shall reasonably cooperate with the TRA Party Representative prior to the making of such deductions

required by reason of such TRA Party&rsquo;s failure to comply with the last sentence of this <U>Section&nbsp;7.10</U>) are required
under applicable law and in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing to the extent permitted
by applicable law, such deduction and withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this TRA Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. To the extent that any payment pursuant to this TRA Agreement
is not reduced by such deductions or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify the applicable withholding agent for any amounts
imposed by any Taxing Authority together with any costs and expenses related thereto. Each TRA Party shall promptly provide the
Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo or other applicable withholding agent with any applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS
Form&nbsp;W-9 or the applicable version of IRS Form&nbsp;W-8) reasonably requested and shall promptly provide an update of any
such Tax form or certificate previously delivered if the same has become incorrect or has expired.</FONT></P>

be readily calculated and for which no remedy at Law would be adequate. Accordingly, each Equityholder and the Sponsor, severally
and not jointly, covenants and agrees with PubCo that it will not (and will cause its respective Affiliates, Permitted Transferees
and Representatives not to) at any time, except with the prior written consent of PubCo, directly or indirectly, disclose any

or the Sponsor (or the Founder Holders) from disclosing Confidential Information to any Affiliate, Representative, limited partner,
member or shareholder of such Party; provided that such Party shall be responsible for any breach of this <U>Section&nbsp;3.3

Equityholder or Sponsor, unless such Confidential Information is actually provided to such Person. PubCo and each Equityholder
and the Sponsor, severally and not jointly, acknowledges and agrees with PubCo that each of the Equityholders, the Sponsor and
their respective Affiliates (including CC Capital and NBOKS) may currently be invested in, may invest in, or may consider investments
in companies that compete either directly or indirectly with PubCo and its subsidiaries, or operate in the same or similar business
as PubCo and its subsidiaries, and that nothing herein shall be in any way construed to prohibit or restrict the Equityholders,
the Sponsor or their respective Affiliates&rsquo; (including CC Capital and NBOKS) ability to maintain, make or consider such
other investments (including purchasing publicly traded securities). PubCo and each Equityholder and the Sponsor, severally and

party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the
indemnifying party&rsquo;s and indemnified party&rsquo;s relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such action; provided, however, that the liability of any Holder under this <U>Section&nbsp;4.10(e)</U>&nbsp;shall be
limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid
or payable by a Party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth in <U>Sections 4.10(a)</U>, <U>4.10(b)</U>&nbsp;and <U>4.10(c)</U>, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such Party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The Parties agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;4.10(e)</U>&nbsp;were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this <U>Section&nbsp;4.10(e)</U>.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f)&nbsp;of the Securities Act) shall be
entitled to contribution pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;4.10(e)</U>&nbsp;from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.</FONT></P>

with the Certificate of Corporate Domestication of CCNB1 Cayman (the &ldquo;<U>Certificate of Domestication</U>&rdquo;).</P>

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation is authorized to issue is [&#9679;] shares,
consisting of (i)&nbsp;1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (&ldquo;<U>Preferred

outstanding shares of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock or upon exchange of Common Units (as defined in the Third Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of E2open Holdings, LLC (the &ldquo;<U>LLC Agreement</U>&rdquo;)) and
corresponding shares of Class&nbsp;V Common Stock) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of
the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section&nbsp;242(b)(2)&nbsp;of the
DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of any of the Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, the
Class&nbsp;B Common Stock, the Class&nbsp;V Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required
therefor, unless a vote of any such holder is required pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation or any certificate of

of capital stock of CCNB1 Cayman issued and outstanding immediately prior to the filing of the Certificate of Domestication
and this Certificate of Incorporation will for all purposes be deemed to be one issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, without any action required on the part of the Corporation or the holders
thereof; provided, however, in accordance with the terms of that certain letter agreement, dated as of October&nbsp;14, 2020,
by and among CC Neuberger Principal Holdings I Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
 &ldquo;<U>Sponsor</U>&rdquo;), CCNB1 Cayman and the other parties thereto, an aggregate 2,500,000 Class&nbsp;B Ordinary

the Corporation comprising a portion of the Dividend Catch-Up Payment, then such equivalent portion of the Dividend Catch-Up Payment
shall be paid in cash in lieu of such in-kind dividend and such holder of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock shall be treated for all purposes
as if it received the in-kind distribution of property, which is then immediately exchanged by such holder for cash of equivalent
value. If a dividend is declared by the Corporation on a Conversion Date, such dividend shall be paid to the holder of each share
of Class&nbsp;B Common Stock converting on such Conversion Date as a holder of Class&nbsp;A Common Stock, and not as part of the

LLC and (vi)&nbsp;the other parties thereto, the total number of directors constituting the whole Board shall be determined from

elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or together with one or more other such
series, as the case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class&nbsp;I, Class&nbsp;II and Class&nbsp;III. Each
class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of such directors. Class&nbsp;I directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing Date, Class&nbsp;II directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing Date and Class&nbsp;III
directors shall initially serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing Date. At
each annual meeting following the Closing Date, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting
shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. If the number of such directors is
changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class
as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting
from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in
no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove, or shorten the term of, any incumbent director. Any such director
shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board is authorized
to assign members of the Board already in office to their respective class in accordance with the Investor Rights Agreement.</FONT></P>

<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the foregoing shall not apply to any claim (a)&nbsp;as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery
determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and the indispensable
party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (b)&nbsp;which
is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c)&nbsp;arising under
federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the federal district courts of the United
States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Article&nbsp;XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by
the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and
exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other
than a court located within the State of Delaware (a &ldquo;<U>foreign action</U>&rdquo;) in the name of any stockholder, such
stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x)&nbsp;the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within
the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an &ldquo;<U>enforcement
action</U>&rdquo;); and (y)&nbsp;having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service
upon such stockholder&rsquo;s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions
would cause the Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
and specific performance, to enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person or
entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed
to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;XII.</P>
