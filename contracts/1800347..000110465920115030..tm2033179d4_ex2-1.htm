Consideration, (2) a portion of the distributions equal to such Company

(B) With respect to each Company Optionholder who holds an
Unvested Company Option, in lieu of the Total Individual Company

vesting date, and (y) the expiration of any restrictions on transferability
applicable to such shares; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
shares subject to such Restricted Share Units shall be settled no later than
two and one-half (2½) months following the last day of the fiscal year in
which such vesting date occurs. The " _Cancelled Option Value_ " shall mean,
with respect to each Unvested Company Option, an amount equal to (x) the value

Optionholder Cash Consideration (such portion, the " _Cancelled Cash Portion_
") that would have been payable to the applicable Company Optionholder
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(iii)(A)_ if the Unvested Company Option had been
vested as of the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will
any Company Optionholder be entitled to receive Class A Common Stock
Consideration or Company Optionholder Cash Consideration in respect of any
Unvested Company Options.

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Cancelled Cash Portion as of the Effective Time shall be retained by Buyer,
and such amount of cash shall be utilized by Buyer to redeem a pro-rata
number of shares of Class A Common Stock held by each holder of
Vested Company Options as of immediately following the Effective Time at a
price per share price equal to the Reference Price. Any amount of cash shall
be applied to redeem a number of shares of Class A Common Stock on a pro rata
basis in respect of all holders of Vested Company Options, such proceeds
delivered (i) first to the Company to fund any portion of the Applicable
Withholding Amount that is not satisfied by the Company Optionholder Cash
Consideration payable to such former holder of Vested Company Options at the
Effective Time, and (ii) second directly to the former holders of Vested
Company Options promptly following, but in all events within ten (10)
Business Days following the date the Applicable Withholding Amount is remitted
to the applicable taxing authorities. To the extent there is not sufficient
cash to redeem a share of Class A Common Stock in full such amount of cash
will be retained by the Buyer. Prior to Closing, Seller shall take, or cause
the Company to take, all necessary or appropriate actions to effectuate the
provisions of _Sections 3.1(c)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(v)_ and all actions
necessary so that the redemptions by Buyer set forth in this _Section
3.1(c)(iv)_ may be effectuated without the consent of the former holders of
Vested Company Options. The aggregate amount of cash and shares of Buyer Class
A Common Stock, Buyer Class B-1 Common Stock and Buyer Class B-2 Common Stock
delivered or deliverable pursuant to _Sections 3.1(c)(iii)_ ,  _(iv)_ and
_(v)_ shall not exceed the applicable amounts that would have been delivered
to all Company Optionholders if all of the Unvested Company Options were
deemed to be Vested Company Options immediately before the Effective Time.

  



  

   

41

 



    



  

(v) Subject to _____Section 3.4_, all payments made pursuant to
_Section 3.1(c)(iii)_ shall be made (without interest and net of the
Applicable Withholding Amount) by or on behalf of the Surviving Company to
each Company Optionholder, with the Applicable Withholding Amount applied in
accordance with the Company's standard payroll practices.

  



  

(vi) Any Equity Interests issued hereunder as Merger Consideration
hereunder shall bear a restrictive legend that prohibits transfers of such
Equity Interests in a manner that would be inconsistent with the Lock-Up
Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Equity Interests Held in Treasury or Owned_. (i) At the
Blocker Effective Time, any limited liability company interests or
other Equity Interests of a Blocker held in the treasury of such Blocker or
owned by such Blocker immediately prior to the Blocker Effective Time shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto and (ii) at the Effective Time, any
Company Units held in the treasury of the Company or owned by any Subsidiary
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto (any such limited liability company interests or other
Equity Interests or such Company Units contemplated by _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , " _Cancelled Equity Interests_ ").

  



  

(e) _Company LLCA Amendment and Restatement_. In connection with
the Company Merger, the Company LLCA shall be amended and restated in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Company A andR
LLCA_") to, among other things, reflect the Company Merger, including the
conversion of Company Units set forth in _Section 3.1(c)_, as set forth in
the Company AandR LLCA (the " _LLCA Amendment and Restatement_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company AandR LLCA shall reflect that the Buyer holds a
number of Pro Forma Buyer Common Units equal to the number of shares of Pro
Forma Buyer Class A Common Stock, a number of Pro Forma Buyer Series 1 RCUs
equal to the number of shares of Pro Forma Buyer Class B-1 Common Stock and a
number of Pro Forma Buyer Series 2 RCUs equal to the number of shares of Pro
Forma Buyer Class B-2 Common Stock and the Company Unitholders hold Pro Forma
Unitholder Common Units, Pro Forma Unitholder Series 1 RCUs and Pro
Forma Unitholder Series 2 RCUs and that no other Equity Interests are
outstanding.

Section 3.2 _Estimated Merger Consideration._

  



  

(a) The aggregate consideration payable with respect to the
Mergers taken together, shall consist of (i) the Aggregate Blocker
Merger Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the Aggregate Company Unitholder Merger
Consideration, _plus_ (iii) the Aggregate Company Optionholder Merger
Consideration, _plus_ (iv) the Equityholder Representative Expense Amount. It
is the intent of the Parties that the sum of (w) the number of shares of
Buyer Class A Common Stock issuable to the Blocker Owners pursuant to the
Blocker Mergers, _plus_ the number of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock
issuable to Company Optionholders pursuant to Restricted Share Units, _plus_
the number of shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock issuable to holders
of Vested Company Options hereunder, _plus_ the number of Common Units
issuable to the Company Unitholders pursuant to the Company Merger shall be
equal (without giving effect to the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional
share or units) to the number of shares equal to (i) the (A) Merger
Consideration _less_ (B) the difference between the Base Aggregate
Cash Amount and the aggregate Cancelled Cash Portion, _divided by_ (ii) the
Reference Price, (x) the number of shares of Buyer Class B-2 Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the Blocker Mergers, _plus_ the number of shares of Buyer
Class B-2 Common Stock issuable to the Company Optionholders pursuant to the
Company Merger, _plus_ the number of Series 2 RCUs issuable to the Company
Unitholders pursuant to the Company Merger shall be equal to (without giving

6,000,000, (y) the number of shares of Buyer Class B-1 Common Stock
issuable pursuant to the Blocker Mergers, _plus_ the number of shares of
Buyer Class B-1 Common Stock issuable to the Company Optionholders pursuant
to the Company Merger, _plus_ the number of Series 1 RCUs issuable to the
Company Unitholders pursuant to the Company Merger shall be equal to (without
giving effect to the payment of cash in lieu of any fractional share or unit)
10,000,000, and (z) the number of shares of Buyer Class V Voting Stock
issuable to Company Unitholders pursuant to the Company Merger shall equal
the number of Common Units held by the Company Unitholders following the
Company Merger, and the cash paid hereunder as Merger Consideration shall be
no greater than the Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount less the Cancelled Cash
Portion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of this Agreement, including _Sections 3.1(c)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and
_(v)_ shall be adjusted as necessary to give effect to this _Section
3.2(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Estimated Merger Consideration is
less than seven hundred million ($700,000,000), no Equity Securities of Buyer
will be issued as Estimated Merger Consideration (other than shares of Buyer
Class B-1 Common Stock, Buyer Class B-2 Common Stock, Series 1 RCUs and
Series 2 RCUs.

  



  

(b) _Estimated Merger Consideration; Estimated Closing Blocker
Indebtedness_.

  



  

(i) No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing,
each Blocker shall deliver to the Company and the Buyer a good faith estimate

representatives with a reasonable opportunity to review the Estimated Closing
Statement and the Company shall consider in good faith the Buyer's, its
accountant's and its other representative's reasonable comments thereto (or
to any component thereof) (it being understood that the Buyer's approval of
the Estimated Closing Statement will not be a condition to the Buyer's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder and the
Company shall have no obligation to revise the Estimated Closing Statement to
reflect any comments provided by the Buyer, its accountants or its other
representatives). The Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the
Blocker Owners and the Company Equityholders) hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the Buyer may rely upon the Allocation Schedule, and in no event will
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) have any
liability to any Blocker Owner, Company Equityholder or other Person with
respect to the allocation of the Merger Consideration payable under this
Agreement or pursuant to the Mergers or on account of payments made in
accordance with the terms hereof as set forth in the Allocation
Schedule; provided, however, that in no event shall the amounts set forth on

Company Unitholder or (C) a Company Optionholder does not deliver to the
Transfer Agent a duly executed and completed Blocker Letter of Transmittal,

fractional share of Buyer Class A Common Stock, Buyer Class B Common Stock,

Units underlying Company Options. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, the Buyer shall pay to each former holder of Blocker Equity
Interests, Company Units or Company Options who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest
cent) determined by _multiplying_ (i) the Reference Price _by_ (ii) the

Section 3.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Equityholder Representative a statement
(the  " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Buyer's
good faith calculation of (i) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents (the "
_Closing Cash_ "), (ii) the amount of Closing Company Indebtedness (the "
_Final Closing Company Indebtedness_ "), (iii) the Net Working Capital
Adjustment (the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "), (iv) the Transaction
Expenses (the " _Closing Transaction Expenses_ "), (v) the Aggregate
Permitted Acquisition Price Amount, (vi) the Merger Consideration, and (vii)
the amount of Closing Blocker Indebtedness of each Blocker (the " _Final
Closing Blocker Indebtedness_ "), in each case prepared in accordance with
the definitions thereof and the Accounting Principles and including reasonably
detailed calculations of the components thereof to enable a review thereof by
the Equityholder Representative.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

(b) The Equityholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days
after its receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") within
which to review the Closing Statement and to deliver to the Buyer written
notice of the Equityholder Representative's disagreement with any item
contained in the Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement and dollar amount of such dispute (to
the extent possible) and attaching reasonable supporting details to enable a
review thereof by the Buyer (a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Closing Statement
shall become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties following the
Review Period unless the Equityholder Representative delivers to the Buyer a
Dispute Notice within the Review Period. If the Equityholder Representative
timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the Closing Statement not
objected to by Equityholder Representative in the Dispute Notice (or by the
Buyer as a result of the items disputed by the Equityholder Representative in
such Dispute Notice) shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties,
and the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall, within thirty (30)
days following the Buyer's receipt of such Dispute Notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), use reasonable best efforts to attempt to resolve in
writing their differences with respect to the items set forth in the Dispute
Notice, and any such resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain
in dispute, then each of the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall
promptly, and in any event, within ten (10) days, execute any reasonable
engagement letter requested by the Valuation Firm and submit all items
remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized, independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative (the "
_Valuation Firm_ ") for resolution, acting as an accounting expert (and not
as an arbitrator) and in accordance with the standards set forth in this
___Section 3.5(b)_, by delivering, within ten (10) days after engagement of
the Valuation Firm, their written position with respect to such
items remaining in dispute. The Valuation Firm's determination shall be based
on (x) the definitions of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness, Net
Working Capital, Aggregate Permitted Acquisition Price Amount and Transaction
Expenses contained herein and the provisions of this Agreement, (y) one (1)
written presentation submitted by each of the Equityholder Representative and
the Buyer (which the Valuation Firm hall be instructed to distribute to the
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer upon receipt of both presentations)
and (z) on one (1) written response by each of the Equityholder Representative
and the Buyer (which the Valuation Firm shall be instructed to distribute to
the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer upon receipt of both such
responses) (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The Buyer and
the Equityholder Representative shall each cooperate fully with the Valuation
Firm so as to enable the Valuation Firm to make such determination as quickly
and as accurately as practicable; _provided_  that no Party (or any of its
Affiliates, advisors or representatives) shall engage in any _ex parte_
communications with the Valuation Firm. The Valuation Firm shall determine,
based solely on the presentations and responses submitted by the
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer, and not by independent review,
only those issues set forth in the Dispute Notice (and those raised by the
Buyer in response thereto) that remain in dispute and shall determine a value
for any such disputed item which is equal to or between the final values
proposed by the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative in their respective
submissions. The Parties shall request that the Valuation Firm make a
decision with respect to all remaining disputed items in the Dispute Notice
within thirty (30) days after the submissions of the Parties, as provided
above, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The final determination
with respect to all disputed items in the Dispute Notice submitted to the
Valuation Firm shall be set forth in a written statement by the Valuation
Firm delivered to the Equityholder Representative and the Buyer and shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Valuation Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is
to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm incurred pursuant
to this ___Section 3.5(b)_ shall be borne by Equityholder Representative, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the
final allocation made by such Valuation Firm of any disputed items in the
Dispute Notice submitted to the Valuation Firm such that the prevailing Party
pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if
the Equityholder Representative claims that the appropriate adjustments are
one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount determined by the Buyer
and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to the
Equityholder Representative seven hundred dollars ($700) of the one
thousand dollars ($1,000) disputed, then the fees, costs and expenses of the
Valuation Firm will be allocated seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to
the Buyer and thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to the Equityholder
Representative.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(c) From and after the Equityholder Representative's receipt of
the Closing Statement until the Closing Cash, Final Closing
Company Indebtedness, Final Closing Blocker Indebtedness, Closing Net Working
Capital and Closing Transaction Expenses are finally determined pursuant to
this ___Section 3.5_, the Equityholder Representative, its Affiliates and
their auditors, accountants and other representatives shall be, upon
reasonable advance notice to the Buyer, permitted reasonable access during
normal business hours to the Company, its Subsidiaries (including E2open) and
the Buyer and their respective auditors, accountants, personnel, books and
records and any other documents or information reasonably requested by such
Person relating to any item properly raised in a Dispute Notice (including the
information, data and work papers used by the Buyer and/or the Company's or
its subsidiaries' auditors or accountants to prepare and calculate the Closing
Cash, Final Closing Company Indebtedness, Final Closing Blocker Indebtedness,
Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Transaction Expenses, but excluding
information the disclosure of which, Buyer has been advised by legal counsel
in good faith, could reasonably be expected to jeopardize any applicable
privilege (including the attorney-client privilege) and, subject to such
Person and their auditors, accountants and other representatives entering
into any such access letters reasonably required).

part of any audit or examination by a regulatory authority or self-regulatory
authority, no such material trade secret or material confidential information
has been disclosed by any Group Company to any Person other than to Persons
subject to a duty of confidentiality or pursuant to a written agreement
restricting the disclosure and use of such trade secrets or confidential
information by such Person. No current or former founder, employee, contractor
or consultant of any Group Company has any right, title or interest, directly
or indirectly, in whole or in part, in any material Owned

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.10(g)_, the Group

(j) No source code that constitutes a Trade Secret within the

agreement. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists,
that (whether with or without the passage of time, the giving of notice or
both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in a requirement that
an escrow agent disclose or deliver any such source code to any third party
by any Group Company. None of the Software included in the Owned
Intellectual Property links to or integrates with any code licensed under an
"open source", "copyleft" or analogous license (including any license

potential obligation to provide, retiree or post-employment health or
life insurance or any other retiree or post-employment welfare-type benefits
to any Person other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or any
similar state Law and for which the covered Person pays the full cost of
coverage, (ii) no Company Employee Benefit Plan is, and no Group Company
sponsors, maintains or contributes to (or is required to contribute to), or
has any Liability(including on account of an ERISA Affiliate) under or with
respect to a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) or
a plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 or 430 of
the Code, and (iii) no Group Company contributes to or has any obligation to
contribute to, or has any Liability (including on account of an ERISA
Affiliate) under or with respect to, any "multiemployer plan," as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA. No Company Employee Benefit Plan is (x) a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code or Section
210 of ERISA, or (y) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA). No Group Company has any, or is reasonably expected
to have any, Liability under Title IV of ERISA or on account of being
considered a single employer under Section 414 of the Code with any other
Person.

  



  

(c) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has
timely received, or may rely upon, a current favorable determination,
advisory or opinion letter from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
the tax-qualified status or to adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Employee Benefit Plan. Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been
established, operated, maintained, funded and administered in accordance in
all material respects with its respective terms and in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability
to any of the Group Companies, there have been no "prohibited transactions"
within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 or 407 of ERISA
that are not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and no breaches
of fiduciary duty (as determined under ERISA) with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan. There is no Proceeding (other than routine and
uncontested claims for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan or against the
assets of any Company Employee Benefit Plan. The Group Companies have complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, including the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (the " _ACA_ "), and none of the Group
Companies has incurred (whether or not assessed), nor is reasonably expected
to incur or be subject to, any material penalty or Tax under the ACA
(including with respect to the reporting requirements under Sections 6055 and
6056 of the Code, as applicable) or under Section 4980H, 4980B or 4980D of
the Code. With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan and except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to any of
the Group Companies, all contributions, distributions, reimbursements and
premium payments that are due have been timely made in accordance with the
terms of the Company Employee Benefit Plan and in compliance with the
requirements of applicable Law, and all contributions, distributions,
reimbursements and premium payments for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not yet due have been made or properly accrued. Each
"defined contribution plan" (as defined in Section 3(34) of ERISA) that was
previously maintained, merged into another plan or terminated by any Group
Company was at any relevant time merged into another plan or terminated, as
applicable, in accordance with such plan's terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
1.401(k)-1(d)(4)(i) in all material respects, and none of the Group Companies
has any current or outstanding material Liability with respect to any such
prior plan.

(d) _Schedule 4.15(a)_ contains a complete and conclusive list
of, and separately designates, all Pension Agreements on the basis of which
any Group Company is obliged to provide occupational pension benefits either
directly or through an external pension provider to current or former
employees, to current or former managing directors or to their surviving
dependents who are located outside of the United States. Insofar as the
Pension Agreements concern direct pension commitments, the amount of the
defined benefit obligation and the number of beneficiaries (active employees,
former employees with vested entitlements and company pensioners) is
definitively set out in the actuarial reports of 29 February 2020 submitted
to the Buyer, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(e) Except as set forth on ___Section 4.15(e)_, neither the
execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, alone or together with any other event
would, directly or indirectly, (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming
due or payable, or required to be provided, to any current or former officer,
employee, director or individual independent contractor of the Group Companies
under a Company Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase the amount
or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be
provided to any current or former officer, employee, director or individual
independent contractor of the Group Companies under a Company Employee
Benefit Plan or otherwise, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding, or forfeiture, of any such benefit or
compensation under a Company Employee Benefit Plan or otherwise, (iv) result
in the forgiveness in whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the
Group Companies to any current or former officer, employee, director or
individual independent contractor of the Group Companies, or (v) limit or
restrict the Group Companies' or the Buyer's ability to merge, amend or
terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with respect
to each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is primarily for the benefit of
employees, directors, individual service providers or individual independent
contractors of the Group Company who reside or work primarily outside of the
United States (each, a " _Foreign Plan_ "): (i) each Foreign Plan required
to be registered or intended to meet certain regulatory requirements for
favorable tax treatment has been timely and properly registered and has been
maintained in all material respects in good standing with the applicable
regulatory authorities and requirements; (ii) no Foreign Plan is a defined
benefit plan (as defined in ERISA, whether or not subject to ERISA), seniority
premium, termination indemnity, provident fund, or gratuity fund, scheme,
plan or arrangement; and (iii) all Foreign Plans that are required to be
funded are fully funded, and adequate reserves have been established with
respect to any Foreign Plan that is not required to be funded.

  



  

   

72

 



    



  

(g) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan or other arrangement that
is, in any part, a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and maintained in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder
in all material respects. No Person has any right against the Group Companies
to be grossed up for, reimbursed or otherwise indemnified for any Tax or
related interest or penalties incurred by such Person, including
under Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code or otherwise.

  



  

(h) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby could, either alone
or in conjunction with any other event, result in the payment or provision of
any amount or benefit that could, individually or in combination with any
other payment, constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code).

  



  

(i) At all relevant times, the Company Employee Benefit Plans have
been adjusted regularly in particular as required by Section 16 of the German
Company Pension Act ( _Betriebsrentengesetz - BetrAVG_ ) and, where
applicable, by contractual or other provisions, and no backlog adjustments (
_nachholende Anpassung_ ) must be made for periods up to the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Insurance_.  _Schedule 4.16_ contains a true, correct
and complete list of all material insurance policies carried by or for the
benefit of the Group Companies (the " _Insurance Policies_ ") and the scope
of coverage of each such Insurance Policy. Each Insurance Policy is legal,
valid, binding and enforceable on the applicable Group Company, is in full
force and effect, and no written notice of cancellation or termination has
been received by any Group Company with respect to any such Insurance
Policy, except as such may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general equitable principles. All premiums due under such policies have been
paid in accordance with the terms of such Insurance Policy. No Group Company
is in material breach or material default under, nor has it taken any action
or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a material breach or material default under, or permit
a material increase in premium, cancellation, material reduction in coverage,
material denial or non-renewal with respect to any Insurance Policy. During
the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective Date, there have been no
material claims by or with respect to the Group Companies under any Insurance
Policy as to which coverage has been denied or disputed in any material
respect by the underwriters of such Insurance Policy.

  



  

Section 4.17 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

     



  

(a) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.17(a)_, (i) each Group
Company is and, since the Lookback Date has been, in compliance in all
material respects with all Laws and Orders applicable to the conduct of the
Group Companies and (ii) since the Lookback Date, no Group Company has
received any written, or oral notice from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person alleging a material violation of or noncompliance with any such
Laws or Orders that remains uncured and outstanding.

  



  

(b) Each Group Company holds all material permits, licenses,
registrations, approvals, consents, accreditations, waivers, exemptions
and authorizations of any Governmental Entity required for the ownership and
use of its assets and properties or the conduct of its business (including
for the occupation and use of the Leased Real Property) as currently conducted
(collectively, " _Permits_ ") and is in compliance with all terms and
conditions of such Permits, except where the failure to have such Permits
would not be reasonably expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business of the Group Companies. All of such Permits are
valid and in full force and effect and none of such Permits will be terminated
as a result of, or in connection with, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. No Group Company is in material default under any such
Permit and no condition exists that, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time or both, would constitute a material default under such Permit, and no
Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, to
suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or limit any such Permit in a manner that
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the
ability of the applicable Group Company to use such Permit or conduct its
business.

  



  

   

73

maintained, and is, and for the Lookback Date, has been, in compliance in all

received any written notice regarding any actual or alleged material violation
of, or material Liabilities under, any Environmental Laws, the subject of
which remains unresolved; (d) no Group Company has (i) used, generated,
manufactured, distributed, sold, treated, stored, disposed of, arranged for
or permitted the disposal of, transported, handled, released, or (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, exposed any Person to, or owned, leased or operated
any property or facility contaminated by, any Hazardous Materials, that has
resulted or could result in material Liability to any of the Group Companies
under Environmental Laws; (e) no consent, approval or authorization of or
registration or filing with any Governmental Entity is required by
Environmental Laws (including the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act,
N.J.S.A. 13:1K-6, et seq.) or Environmental Permits in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; and (f) no Group Company has assumed,
undertaken or become subject to any material Liability of any other Person, or
provided an indemnity with respect to any material Liability, in each case
under Environmental Laws. The Group Companies have provided to the Buyer true
and correct copies of all material environmental, health and safety
assessments, reports and audits relating to any of the Group Companies or
their current properties, facilities or operations, that in each case, were
prepared or conducted on or after the Lookback Date and are in the Group
Companies' possession or reasonable control.

Company has good and marketable title to, or, in the case of leased or
subleased assets, a valid and binding leasehold interest in, or, in the case

any Group Company, or (iii) owns any direct or indirect interest of any kind

to participate in the profits of, any Person which is a supplier, customer
or landlord, of any Group Company (other than in connection with ownership of

and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and, subject to the
receipt of the requisite approval of the Buyer Shareholder Voting Matters by
the Buyer Shareholders, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and

material breach of any provision of the Governing Documents of any Buyer
Party; (b) require any material filing with, or the obtaining of any material
consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity; (c) result in a material
violation of or a material default (or give rise to any right of termination,

modification is contemplated by the Buyer. The Buyer is not a party to or
bound by any side letters with respect to the Trust Agreement or (except for
the Trust Agreement) any Contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether

documents required to be filed or furnished under the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act (excluding Section 16 under the Securities

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

  



  

   

83

or (ii) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002) with respect to any Buyer SEC Document. Each such certification is
correct and complete. The Buyer maintains disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act; such controls
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
concerning the Buyer is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Buyer's SEC filings. As used in this
___Section 6.8(c)_, the term " _file_ " shall be broadly construed to
include any manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied
or otherwise made available to the SEC.

Document, the Buyer has not conducted any material business activities other
than activities directed toward the accomplishment of a Business Combination.
Except as set forth in the Buyer Governing Documents, there is no Contract,
commitment, or Order binding upon the Buyer or to which the Buyer is a party
which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting
or impairing any business practice of the Buyer or any acquisition
of property by the Buyer or the conduct of business by the Buyer after the
Closing, other than such effects, individually or in the aggregate, which are
not, and would not reasonably be expected to be, material to the Buyer.

Section 6.14 _Financing_. The Buyer has delivered to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of each of the Subscription Agreements entered
into by the Buyer with the PIPE Investors, the NBOKS Side Letter and the
Backstop Agreement. To the Knowledge of the Buyer and assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the applicable Equity Financing
Source set forth in the Subscription Agreements, the Forward Purchase
Agreement and the Backstop Agreement, with respect to each Equity Financing
Source, as of the Effective Date, the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop
Agreement or Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter)
(as applicable) are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or
terminated, or otherwise amended or modified, and no withdrawal,
termination, amendment or modification is contemplated by any party thereto.
Each of the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement and the Forward
Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Buyer and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer and
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the applicable
Equity Financing Source set forth in the Subscription Agreements, Forward
Purchase Agreement and Backstop Agreement, each Equity Financing Source, and
neither the execution or delivery by any party thereto, nor the performance of
any party's obligations under any such Subscription Agreement, the Backstop
Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side
Letter) violates any Laws. The Subscription Agreements, the Forward Purchase
Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) and the Backstop
Agreement provide that the Company is a third-party beneficiary thereof and
is entitled to enforce such agreement against the applicable Equity Financing
Source, to the extent set forth therein. Other than the NBOKS Side Letter,
there are no other agreements, side letters, or arrangements between the
Buyer and any Equity Financing Source relating to any Subscription Agreement,
the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) or the
Backstop Agreement, and, as of the Effective Date, to Buyer's Knowledge,
there are no facts or circumstances that may reasonably be expected to result
in any of the conditions set forth in any Subscription Agreement, the
Backstop Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS
Side Letter) (other than, in the case of the Backstop Agreement, the Buyer
Share Redemptions or other than as a result in a change of the
Utilization Limit (as such term is defined therein, in accordance with the
terms thereof)) not being satisfied, or the aggregate amount of all
Subscription Amounts (as defined in the Subscription Agreements), the Forward
Purchase Amount or the Backstop Amount not being available to the Buyer, on
the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of the Buyer
or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, any Equity Financing Source party
thereto, under any term or condition of any Subscription Agreement, the
Backstop Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS
Side Letter) and, as of the Effective Date, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, no
event has occurred or circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would or would reasonably be likely to (i) make any of the
statements by the Buyer or any Equity Financing Source party thereto set
forth in the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement or the Forward
Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) inaccurate in any
material respect or (ii) subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the Buyer
Parties) of the conditions set forth in _Section 11.1_ and _Section
11.2 _of this Agreement, otherwise result in any portion of the financing
pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement (other than
as a result in a change of the Utilization Limit (as such term is defined
therein, in accordance with the terms thereof)) or Forward Purchase Agreement
(as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) not being available. The Subscription
Agreements, the Backstop Agreement and the Forward Purchase Agreement (as
amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) contain all of the conditions precedent to
the obligations of the Equity Financing Sources to contribute to the Buyer
such Equity Financing Source's Subscription Amount (as defined in the
Subscription Agreements), Backstop Amount or the Forward Purchase Amount, as
applicable, set forth in such Equity Financing Source's Subscription
Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side
Letter) or the Backstop Agreement, as applicable, on the terms therein. No
fees, consideration or other discounts are payable or have been agreed to by
the Buyer to any Equity Financing Source in respect of its PIPE Investment or
the contribution of the Forward Purchase Amount or the Backstop Amount,
except as set forth in the Subscription Agreements, the Forward Purchase
Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side Letter) and the Backstop Agreement,
as applicable.

limits of liability that are no less advantageous than the coverage provided
under any Group Company's or the Buyer's existing policies (the policies
contemplated by the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , collectively, the "
_Tail Policy_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall the Buyer be required to
expend on the premium thereof in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of

available at the Premium Cap. No claims made under or in respect of such Tail
Policy related to any fiduciary or employee of any Group Company shall be

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  



  

Section 9.1 _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the
Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall make or cause to be made
available to the Equityholder Representative (at the Equityholder
Representative's sole expense) all books, records, and documents relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date of any Blocker or any Group Company (and the
assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and documents)
during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior written request as
may be reasonably necessary for (a) investigating, settling, preparing for the
defense or prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any Proceeding (other
than an actual or potential Proceeding (i) brought or threatened to be
brought by the Equityholder Representative or the Company arising under this
Agreement or (ii) brought or threatened to be brought by the Buyer or its
Affiliates against the Equityholder Representative, any Blocker Owner or any
Group Company arising under this Agreement), (b) preparing reports to
Governmental Entities or (c) such other purposes (that do not involve an

their Affiliates against the Buyer or by the Buyer or its Affiliates against
the Equityholder Representative relating to or arising out of this
Agreement) for which access to such documents is reasonably necessary. The
Buyer shall (at the Company's sole expense) cause each Group Company to
maintain and preserve all such books, records and other documents in the
possession of the Group Companies as of the Closing Date for the greater of
(i) six (6) years after the Closing Date and (ii) any applicable statutory or
regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer shall not be required to provide
any access or information to the Equityholder Representative or any of its
respective representatives, which the Buyer reasonably believes, upon the
advice of counsel, constitutes information protected by attorney-client
privilege or which would violate any obligation owed to a third party under
Contract or Law. This _Section 9.1_  shall not apply to Taxes or Tax
matters, which are the subject of ___Section 10.1_.

  



  

   

106

 



    



  

Article X  _ 
 TAX MATTERS_

  



  

Section 10.1 _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Preparation of Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, at the cost
and expense of the Company all income Tax Returns with respect to Pass-
Through Income Taxes of each Group Company for any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period, in each case, that are
due after the Closing Date (taking into account applicable extensions). Each
such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Group
Companies' past practice except to the extent not "more likely than not"
to be upheld under applicable Law. Each such Tax Return shall be submitted to
the Equityholder Representative for review no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions). The Buyer shall incorporate, or cause to be
incorporated, all reasonable comments received from the Equityholder
Representative no later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing
any such Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions) and the Buyer
will cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed and will provide a copy of
such filed Tax Returns to the Equityholder Representative.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Tax Return described in
this _____Section 10.1(a)_ for a taxable period that includes the Closing
Date (i) for which the "interim closing method" under Section 706 of the Code
(or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) is available shall
be prepared in accordance with such method and (ii) for which an election
under Section 754 of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law) may be made shall make such election. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company Equityholders or Blocker Owners, as
applicable, at their sole cost and expense, shall be solely responsible for
filing all of the Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company
Equityholders or Blocker Owners, as applicable, and paying all of the Taxes
due and owing by the Company Equityholders or Blocker Owners, as applicable
(including to the extent attributable to income of any Group Company that
flows up to the Company Equityholders).

  



  

(b) For purposes of determining whether the following Taxes are
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period:

  



  

(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar periodic Taxes
imposed for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of days in the portion of the taxable period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period;

  



  

(ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on any Group Company (or the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates as a result of its direct or indirect
ownership of an Group Company) or Blocker as a result of income of any Flow-
Thru Entity realized on or prior to the Closing Date (such income being
computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends as of the end of
the day on the Closing Date and closed its books), such Taxes shall be
treated as Taxes of an Group Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period;

  



   

107

 



    

  



  

(iii) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period
(including Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts, payments, or
payroll (to the extent not covered by _clauses (i)_ - _(ii)_ above)), the
amount allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on
an interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date
using a "closing of the books" methodology; _provided_ that for purposes of
this _clause (iii)_ , any item determined on an annual or periodic basis
(including amortization and depreciation deductions and the effects of
graduated rates) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date based on the mechanics set forth in _clause (i)_
for periodic Taxes;

  



  

(iv) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest, penalties or
additions, all such Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (determined in accordance with _clauses (i)_ - _(iii)_ above) whether
such items are incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or
after the Closing Date; and

  



  

(v) all Transaction Tax Deductions will, in each case, be
allocated and attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law at a "more likely than not" or higher level of
comfort.

  



  

(c) Each Party shall reasonably cooperate (and cause its
Affiliates to reasonably cooperate), as and to the extent reasonably
requested by each other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to ___Section 10.1(a)_ and any examination or other
Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Group Company or
Blocker. Such cooperation shall include the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit or other Proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Following the Closing, the Company, the Blockers, the Company
Equityholders and the Blocker Owners shall (and the Company Equityholders and
Blocker Owners shall cause their respective Affiliates to) retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Group Companies or
Blockers relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by the Equityholders' Representative, any extensions thereof) of
the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Each Party shall furnish
the other Parties with copies of all relevant correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to any Taxes for which the other may have an indemnification
obligation under this Agreement. The Company Equityholders and Blocker Owners
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) provide
any information reasonably requested to allow the Buyer or any Group Company
or Blocker to comply with any information reporting or withholding
requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to compute the
amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment
made in connection with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this
___Section 10.1(c)_ shall not apply to any dispute or threatened dispute
among the Parties.

  



  

(d) The Buyer shall cause the Company and Blockers, as applicable,
to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer Taxes, and, if
required by applicable Law, the Company Equityholders, the Blocker Owners,
the Company, the Blockers and the Buyer will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to
establish any available exemption from (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

  



  

   

108

 



    



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that for U.S. federal and,
as applicable, state and local Tax purposes, they intend that (i)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (A) be treated as a sale as
of the Closing Date of Company Units by the Company Equityholders to the
Buyer and a purchase of such Company Units by the Buyer from the Company
Equityholders (the " _Sale_ "), in exchange for the sum in cash, and
allocated as between the Company Equityholders, as set forth in the Allocation
Schedule in a transaction described in Section 741 of the Code (and any
similar applicable state or local provisions of Tax Law) and (B) give rise to
an adjustment to the Buyer's basis in the direct and indirect assets of the
Company pursuant to Section 743 of the Code (and, in each case, any
equivalent adjustments for applicable state and local income Tax purposes),
(ii) the Sale be governed by the first sentence of each of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.197-2(h)(12)(i) and Section 1.197-2(h)(12)(v)(A), (iii)
the contribution by the Buyer of the Buyer Contribution Amount contemplated by
___Section 3.2(e)_ be treated as a contribution of an amount of cash equal
to the Buyer Contribution Amount by the Buyer to the Company governed by
Section 721 of the Code (and any similar applicable state or local provisions
of Tax Law), (iv) the Domestication qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, (v) each Blocker Merger and the
corresponding Buyer Merger, taken together, constitute an integrated plan
described in Rev. Rul. 2001-46, 2001-2 C.B. 321, that qualifies as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (vi) this
Agreement be, and hereby adopt this Agreement as, a  " _plan of
reorganization_ " within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code with respect
to each of the Domestication and each of the reorganizations described in
_clause (v)_ (collectively, the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and (vii)
none of the Buyer Parties, the Group Companies, the Buyer, the Blockers, the
Company Equityholders or the Blocker Owners shall take any action, or fail to
take any action, that would reasonably be expected to cause each Blocker
Merger and the corresponding Buyer Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify
for the Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(f) Within one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing
Date, (i) the Buyer will prepare, and deliver to the Equityholder
Representative, an allocation statement allocating the Adjusted Aggregate
Cash Amount and any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes (the " _Aggregate Consideration_ ") (A) among the
equity interests of each Blocker and the Company Units acquired by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement and (B) with respect to the amount allocated to the
Company Units pursuant to _clause (A)_ , among the assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are classified as entities that are disregarded
as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, in each
case, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (and any other applicable
section of the Code), the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of state or local Law) and the methodologies set forth on _Schedule
10.1(f)_ (the " _Allocation_ ") and (ii) the Equityholder Representative
will prepare, and deliver to the Buyer, a balance sheet, as of the Closing
Date, that sets out the Tax basis of the assets then owned by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries that are classified as entities that are
disregarded as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
on the Closing Date and the amount of the liabilities of the Company and such
Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the " _Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ ").
The Allocation shall contain sufficient detail to permit the Parties to make
the computations and adjustments required under Sections 743(b), 751 and
755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within twenty (20)
days after the receipt of the Tax Basis Balance Sheet and Allocation, the
receiving Party will propose any changes or will indicate its concurrence
therewith. If the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative do not agree with
the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or Allocation, then the Buyer and the Equityholder
Representative shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Tax
Basis Balance Sheet or the Allocation, as applicable, in a manner
consistent with applicable income Tax Law. If the Buyer and the Equityholder
Representative cannot reach agreement on the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or the
Allocation within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the other Party's
proposed changes, then the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative shall
submit the dispute to the Valuation Firm or, if unavailable, another
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer and
the Equityholder Representative (the " _Tax Accounting Firm_ ") for
resolution, acting as an accounting expert (and not as an arbitrator). For
this purpose, (i) the Tax Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
disputed item greater than the greatest value for such disputed item claimed
by any party or less than the lowest value for such disputed item claimed by
any party and (ii) all fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Tax Accounting Firm will be allocated between the Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Company Equityholders, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the
Tax Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as
finally determined by the Tax Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted. The Tax Basis Balance Sheet and the
Allocation, as agreed to by the Buyer and the Equityholder Representative or
as finally determined by the Tax Accounting Firm, as the case may be, shall be
binding on all Parties (the " _Final Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ " and the "
_Final Allocation,_ " respectively).

  



   

109

 



    

  



  

(g) The Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective
applicable Affiliates to: (1) prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistent with the Final Tax Basis Balance Sheet, Final Allocation and
Intended Tax Treatment (collectively, the " _Tax Positions_ "); (2) take no
position in any communication (whether written or unwritten) with any
Governmental Entity or any other action inconsistent with the Tax Positions;
(3) promptly inform each other of any challenge by any Governmental Entity to
any portion of the Tax Positions; and (4) consult with and keep one another
informed with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or
submission with respect to, any such challenge to any portion of the Tax
Positions.

  



  

(h) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, the Company
Equityholders and the Company shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to, make or cause to be made any election under Treasury
Regulations Section 301.9100-22 (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Laws) with respect to any Group Company. With respect to any audit,
examination or other Proceeding of any Group Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and for which the election provided for in Section 6226 of the Code (or
any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) is available, the
Company Equityholders and the Company shall, or shall cause their respective
applicable Affiliates to, timely make, and to the extent required, fully
cooperate with the Buyer and the Company to make, all such available
elections in accordance with applicable Laws. The Company Equityholders and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective applicable Affiliates to,
comply with all applicable Laws with respect to the making and
implementation of any such election.

  



  

(i) In the event of any proposed audit, adjustment, assessment,
examination, claim or other controversy or proceeding relating to Pass-
Through Income Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Tax Contest_"),
the Buyer will, or will cause the applicable Group Company to, within 15 days
of becoming aware of such Tax Contest, notify the Equityholder Representative
of such Tax Contest; provided, that no failure or delay of Buyer in providing
such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of the
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Company Equityholders are materially and adversely prejudiced as a result
of such failure or delay. Buyer or the applicable Group Company shall endeavor
in good faith to include, to the extent reasonably practicable, in such
notice any written notice or other documents received from any Governmental
Entity with respect to such Tax Contest. The Buyer will control the contest
or resolution of any such Tax Contest; _provided_ , the Buyer will obtain the
prior consent of the Equityholder Representative (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim to the extent doing so
would reasonably be expected to have a disproportionate adverse impact on the
Company Equityholders as compared with the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date);
_provided_ , further, the Equityholder Representative will be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose, in each case the fees and expenses of which will be borne
solely by the Company Equityholders.

  



  

(j) After the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Group Companies) will not, without the consent of the Equityholder
Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), (a) amend or otherwise modify any income Tax Return with respect
to Pass-Through Income Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (b) extend or waive,
or cause to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period
for the assessment of any Pass-Through Income Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, or (c) make or change any income election or accounting method or
practice with respect to Pass-Through Income Taxes for Pre-Closing Tax
Periods; _provided_ that, in each case the Equityholder Representative's
withholding, conditioning or delaying of consent over any such action shall
be deemed to be unreasonable to the extent that such action is required under
applicable Law.

that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not set forth
herein. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of
sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations and no Person has
any special relationship with another Person that would justify any
expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an
arm's-length transaction.

Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related
to or arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual
claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation,
validity and enforceability hereof, and the performance of the obligations
imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-
of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
(WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF,
CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT

such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this ___Section
13.7_, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a
final judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at
equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (a) any
right or obligation with respect to any Debt Financing Source in connection

hereby and thereby, and any claim, controversy, dispute, suit, action or
proceeding relating thereto or arising thereunder, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, (b) each party
hereto hereby submits itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in
the City of New York and the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and any appellate courts thereof with respect to any
suit, action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, whether at law or in equity and whether in tort, contract
or otherwise, and hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any such
suit, action or proceeding in any other forum, and (c) each party hereto
hereby waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any suit,
action or proceeding against any Debt Financing Source in connection with

otherwise.

covenants or agreements set forth herein or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement including any rights arising out of any breach of

thereof), in each case, except for (i) those covenants and agreements that by
their terms contemplate performance, in each case, in whole or in part after

(including any breaches occurring after the Closing), which shall survive
until thirty (30) days following the date of the expiration, by its terms of
the obligation of the applicable Party under such covenant or agreement.

provisions set forth herein shall be deemed a waiver by any Party of any
right or remedy which such Party may have at Law or in equity in the case of
Fraud.

Section 13.9 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company, each Blocker
and the Equityholder Representative acknowledge that the Buyer has
established the Trust Account for the benefit of its public Buyer
Shareholders, which holds proceeds of its initial public offering. For and in
consideration of the Buyer entering into this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, each of the Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder
Representative, for itself and the Affiliates and Persons it has the
authority to bind, hereby agrees it does not now and shall not at any
time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to
any assets in the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to (i) the public
Buyer Shareholders upon the redemption of their shares and (ii) the
underwriters of Buyer's initial public offering in respect of their deferred
underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account, in each case as set
forth in the Trust Agreement (collectively, the " _Trust Distributions_ ")),
and hereby waives any claims it has or may have at any time solely against
the Trust Account (including the Trust Distributions) as a result of, or
arising out of, any discussions, Contracts or agreements (including this
Agreement) among the Buyer and the Company or the Company's Equityholders and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including the Trust
Distributions) for any reason whatsoever; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 13.9_ shall limit any right to specifically enforce this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 13.11_. The Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder
Representative agree and acknowledge that such irrevocable waiver is material
to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Buyer and the Sponsor
to induce the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, and the Company, each
Blocker and the Equityholder Representative further intend and understand such
waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company, each Blocker
and the Equityholder Representative and each of their respective Affiliates
and Persons that they have the authority to bind under applicable Law. To the
extent that the Company, any Blocker or the Equityholder Representative or
any of their respective Affiliates or Persons that they have the authority to
bind commences any Proceeding against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter
relating to the Buyer or its representatives, which proceeding seeks, in
whole or in part, monetary relief against the Buyer or its
representatives, the Company, each Blocker and the Equityholder
Representative hereby acknowledge and agree that their respective and their
respective Affiliates' sole remedy shall be against assets of the Buyer not
in the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit the Company, any
Blocker or the Equityholder Representative or such Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of their behalves) to have any claim against the Trust
Account (including the Trust Distributions) or any amounts contained in the
Trust Account while in the Trust Account. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 13.9 _shall serve to limit or prohibit (i) the
Company's, each Blocker's, any Company Unitholder's, any Company
Optionholder's or the Equityholder Representative's right to pursue a claim
against the Buyer for legal relief against assets held outside the Trust
Account or pursuant to _Section 13.11_ for specific performance or other
non-monetary relief, or (ii) any claims that the Company, any Blocker, any
Company Unitholder, any Company Optionholder or the Equityholder
Representative may have in the future against the Buyer's assets or funds
that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been
released from the Trust Account (other than the Trust Distributions) and any
assets that have been purchased or acquired with any such funds) other than
as contemplated by this Agreement,.

  



  

Section 13.10 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the other agreements, certificates, instruments and
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement may be executed and delivered
in one or more counterparts and by e-mail, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. No
Party shall raise the use of e-mail to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a fax machine or e-mail as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a Contract and each Party forever waives any
such defense.

Section 13.11 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions hereof
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching
Party would have no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-breaching Party would
be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees that each other Party
shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable
relief (without posting of bond or other security or needing to prove
irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof and to enforce
specifically this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to the extent
expressly contemplated herein or therein and the terms and provisions hereof
in any Proceeding, in addition to any other remedy to which such Person may
be entitled. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the
other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in accordance with this _Section 13.11_ shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction.

  



  

Section 13.12 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than
the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder (other than (x) Non-Party Affiliates, each of whom is an express
third-party beneficiary hereunder to the provisions of _Section 13.14_ and
(y) the Indemnified Persons, each of whom is an express third-
party beneficiary hereunder to the provisions of _Section 8.15_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything to the contrary contained herein,
each Debt Financing Source is intended to be, and shall be, an express third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 13.12 _and _Sections 8.13(c)_ , _13.1_ ,
_13.3_ , and _13.7_.

Section 13.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied herein (except in the case of the immediately succeeding
sentence) or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that any Party may
be a partnership or limited liability company, each Party hereto, by its
acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties shall have any obligation
hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no
recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith shall be had against, any former, current or future director,
officer, agent, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator,
controlling Person, fiduciary, representative or employee of any Party (or
any of their successors or permitted assignees), against any former, current,
or future general or limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any
Party (or any of their successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate
thereof or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent,
employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or
member of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the Parties
(each, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a " _Non-Party
Affiliate_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) by or on
behalf of such Party against the Non-Party Affiliates, by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being agreed and
acknowledged that no personal Liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed
on, or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Party Affiliate, as such, for any
obligations of the applicable Party under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, under any documents or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim
(whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a
Non-Party Affiliate may have obligations under any documents, agreements, or
instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or otherwise contemplated
hereby if such Non-Party Affiliate is party to such document, agreement or
instrument. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in, and subject in all
cases to the terms and conditions of and limitations herein, this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action of any kind
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof, may only be brought against the entities
that are named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Party
Affiliate is intended as a third-party beneficiary of this ___Section
13.14_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, in no event
shall the Group Companies, the Blockers or the Equityholder Representative or
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives seek to recover monetary
damages from any Equity Financing Source in connection with the obligations
of the Equity Financing Sources for the Equity Financing under the applicable
Subscription Agreement, Permitted Equity Subscription Agreement, the Backstop
Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (other than pursuant to the
Subscription Agreements in accordance with their terms to the extent expressly
set forth therein). Nothing in this ___Section 13.14 _shall in any way limit
or qualify the rights and obligations of the Equity Financing Sources for the
applicable Equity Financing and the other parties to the Subscription
Agreements, any Permitted Equity Subscription Agreement, the Backstop
Agreement or the Forward Purchase Agreement (as amended by the NBOKS Side
Letter), as applicable, to each other thereunder or in connection
therewith (including the Company's rights as a third party beneficiary to the
Subscription Agreements, the Backstop Agreement and the Forward Purchase
Agreement in accordance with their terms to the extent expressly set forth
therein).

  



  

Section 13.15 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the outstanding shares of Buyer Capital Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall
have occurred (including any of the foregoing in connection with the
Domestication), then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon
the number of shares of Buyer Capital Stock will be appropriately adjusted to
provide to the Blocker Owners and the Company Equityholders and the
Buyer Shareholders the same economic effect as contemplated hereby prior to
such event.

(including, following the Closing, the Group Companies), irrevocably

prior to the Closing (and all records of such communications) between any or
all of the Company Equityholders, the Blocker Owners, the Blockers, the Group
Companies, any officer, director, employee, or agent of any Group Company,
and their respective Affiliates, any of the financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors to the foregoing, and Willkie and its partners
and employees, and all of Willkie's work product with respect to, relating
to, or in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery
and closing under, or any dispute or Proceeding arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement or any
acquisition proposal, and all matters related to any of the foregoing, in
each case, to the extent constituting attorney-client privileged
communication, work product, materials or matters (individually and
collectively " _Attorney-Client Communications_ ") shall at all times be
subject to the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine, as
applicable, solely in favor of and held by Company Equityholders and Blocker
Owners, and shall be deemed to be confidential and proprietary information
solely of the Company Equityholders and Blocker Owners; (ii) such privilege
or doctrine shall be held solely by, and may be waived only by, the Company
Equityholders and Blocker Owners and their respective personal
representatives, successors and assigns, and not by the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies), or their Affiliates, successor
or assigns; (iii) all Attorney-Client Communications, and all records, and
copies or extracts of records, of or maintained by the Acquired Companies of
Attorney-Client Communications in any form, including hard copy or in digital
or electronic media, and all rights, privileges and interests therein shall
be (and hereby are) irrevocably and completely assigned, transferred and
delivered by the Group Companies to the Company Equityholders and Blocker
Owners immediately prior to Closing, and the Buyer, the Group Companies and
the Subsidiaries of the Buyer and their Affiliates, successors and assigns
shall have no right or interest therein of any nature whatsoever
including any access to or possession of such records or copies and any right
to waive the attorney-client privilege or attorney work-product doctrine with
respect to any Attorney-Client Communications and (iv) Willkie shall have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such Attorney-Client Communications
or files to the Group Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between Willkie and the Group Companies.

Article XIV  _ 
 AUTHORIZATION OF THE EQUITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_

  



  

Section 14.1 _Authorization of Equityholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Appointment_. By adoption of this Agreement, execution of a
Blocker Letter of Transmittal, a Company Unitholder Letter of Transmittal or a
Company Optionholder Letter of Transmittal, and the acceptance of any portion
of the Merger Consideration, each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and
Company Optionholder hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the
Equityholder Representative as his, her or its, agent and representative to,
in addition to the other rights and authority granted to the Equityholder
Representative elsewhere in this Agreement, to execute any and all
instruments or other documents on behalf of such Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder, and to do any and all other acts or
things on behalf of such Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and
Company Optionholder, which the Equityholder Representative may deem
necessary, advisable, convenient or appropriate, or which may be required
pursuant to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise, in
connection with the facilitation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and the performance of all obligations
hereunder or thereunder at or following the Closing, including the exercise
of the power to: (i) execute the Ancillary Agreements, instruments or
certificates on behalf of each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company
Optionholder; (ii) act for each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company
Optionholder with respect to any adjustment to the Estimated Merger
Consideration and the Ancillary Agreements; (iii) give and receive notices
and communications to or from the Buyer Parties relating to this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions and other matters
contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by such Blocker Owner,
Company Unitholder or Company Optionholder individually); (iv) administration
of the provisions of this Agreement; (v) give or agree to, on behalf of all
or any of the Blocker Owner, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders,
any and all consents, waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the
Equityholder Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, to be
necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the execution or delivery
of any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith; (vi) amending this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or any of the instruments to be delivered to the Buyer hereunder or
thereunder; (vii) (A) dispute or refrain from disputing, on behalf of each
Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder, any amounts to be
received by such Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder
under this Agreement or any claim made by the Buyer Parties under this
Agreement, (B) negotiate and compromise, on behalf of each such Blocker
Owner, Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder, any dispute that may arise
under, and exercise or refrain from exercising any remedies available under,
this Agreement, and (C) execute, on behalf of each such Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder, any settlement agreement, release or
other document with respect to such dispute or remedy; (viii)
engage attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of the Blocker
Owners, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders in connection with this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement and pay any fees related thereto, and
(ix) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Equityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Equityholder Representative shall have authority and
power to act on behalf of each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company
Optionholder with respect to the disposition, settlement or other handling of
all claims under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and all rights or
obligations arising under this Agreement or thereunder. The Blocker Owners,
the Company Unitholders and the Company Optionholders shall be bound by all
actions taken and documents executed by the Equityholder Representative in
connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the Buyer
Parties shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the
Equityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Equityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each Blocker
Owner, any Company Unitholder or any Company Optionholder.

  



  

   

123

 



    



  

  

(b) _Authorization_. Notwithstanding _Section 14.1(a)_, in the
event that the Equityholder Representative is of the opinion that it
requires further authorization or advice from the Blocker Owners, Company
Unitholders and Company Optionholders on any matters concerning this
Agreement, the Equityholder Representative shall be entitled to seek such
further authorization from the Equityholders prior to acting on their behalf.
In such event, each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder
shall vote in accordance with the pro rata portion of the Merger
Consideration paid to such Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company
Optionholder in accordance with this Agreement and the authorization of a
majority of such Persons shall be binding on all of the Blocker
Owners, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders and shall constitute
the authorization of the Blocker Owners, Company Unitholders and Company
Optionholders. The appointment of the Equityholder Representative is coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder in any manner or for any reason. This
authority granted to the Equityholder Representative shall not be affected by
the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to
act of any principal pursuant to any applicable Law. Insight Venture Partners,
LLC hereby accepts its appointment as the initial Equityholder
Representative. Any decision, act, consent or instruction taken by the
Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Equityholders, pursuant to this
_Section 14.1(b)_ (each, an " _Authorized Action_ ") shall be final, binding
and conclusive on each Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company
Optionholder as fully as if such Person had taken such Authorized Action. The
Buyer Parties agree that the Equityholder Representative, as the Equityholder
Representative, shall have no liability to any Buyer Party for any Authorized
Action.

  



  

(c) _Resignation; Vacancies_. The Equityholder Representative may
resign from its position as Equityholder Representative at any time by
written notice delivered to the Buyer and the Equityholders. If there is a
vacancy at any time in the position of the Equityholder Representative for
any reason, such vacancy shall be filled by a majority vote in accordance with
the method set forth in _Section 14.1(b)_.

  



  

(d) _No Liability_. All acts on behalf of the Equityholder
Representative hereunder in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be
acts of the Blocker Owners, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders and
not of the Equityholder Representative individually. Without limiting
_Section 13.11_, the Equityholder Representative shall not be liable to the
Buyer, any Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder or Company Optionholder or any
other Person in its capacity as the Equityholder Representative for any
reason, including for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in
connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; _provided_
, subject to _Section 14.1(e)_, the foregoing will not prevent liability to
the Buyer for the Equityholder Representative's willful breach of this
Agreement. The Equityholder Representative shall not be liable to the Blocker
Owners, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders, in its capacity as the
Equityholder Representative, for any liability of any Blocker Owner,
Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder or otherwise, or for any error of
judgment or for any mistake in fact or Law, except in the case of the
Equityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Equityholder Representative may seek the advice of legal
counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any
of the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or its duties
or rights hereunder or thereunder, and it shall be fully protected with
respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel. The Equityholder Representative shall not by reason of
this Agreement have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Equityholder,
except in respect of amounts received on behalf of any Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder (if any). The Buyer Parties shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on any decision, action (or inaction), consent
or instruction of the Equityholder Representative as being the decision,
action, consent or instruction of the Blocker Owners, Company Unitholders and
Company Optionholders, and the Buyer and the Merger Subs shall be entitled to
deal solely with the Equityholder Representative (and shall not be required
to deal with any individual Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder or Company
Optionholder, in its capacity as such) with respect to all matters in
connection with this Agreement. The Buyer Parties are hereby relieved from
any Liability to any Person for acts done by them in accordance with any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Equityholder Representative.

  



  

   

124

 



    



  

(e) _Indemnification; Expenses_. Each Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder shall severally (based on each such
Blocker Owner's, Company Unitholder's or Company Optionholder's Pro Rata
Percentage), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Equityholder
Representative from and against any loss incurred without gross negligence or
willful misconduct (as determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction) on the part of the Equityholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of its duties hereunder. The Equityholder Representative may
use the Equityholder Representative Expense Amount to pay any fees, costs,
expenses or other obligations incurred by the Equityholder Representative
acting in its capacity as such. Any expenses or taxable income incurred by the
Equityholder Representative in connection with the performance of its duties
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall not be the personal
obligation of the Equityholder Representative but shall be payable by and
attributable to the Blocker Owners, Company Unitholders and Company
Optionholders based on each such Blocker Owner's Company Unitholder's and
Company Optionholder's Pro Rata Percentage. From and after the Closing, if
the Equityholder Representative determines that the amounts in the
Equityholder Representative Expense Account are insufficient to satisfy
current or future (whether realized or potential) costs and expenses of the
Equityholder Representative, it shall be entitled to withhold on a pro rata
basis from amounts otherwise due to the Blocker Owners, the Company
Unitholders and the Company Optionholders under this Agreement or under any
Ancillary Agreement amounts as it deems necessary to provide for such
administrative costs; provided that such amounts shall be deemed to be
included in the Equityholder Representative Expense Account. The Equityholder
Representative may also from time to time submit invoices to the Equityholders
covering such expenses and liabilities, which shall be paid by the Blocker
Owners, Company Unitholders and Company Optionholders promptly following
the receipt thereof based on their respective Pro Rata Percentages. Upon the
request of any Blocker Owner, Company Unitholder and Company Optionholder,
the Equityholder Representative shall provide such Blocker Owner, Company
Unitholder and Company Optionholder with an accounting of all material
expenses and liabilities paid by the Equityholder Representative in its
capacity as such.

Common Units and Equity Securities as the Managing Member shall determine in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions in this _Section 4.1_ and
_Section 4.3_. Subject to this _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.3_, each

Member shall approve, including pursuant to warrants, options, or other rights
or property to acquire Units or that may be converted into Units. The Company

_provided_ that any such issuance, and the admission of any Person as a Member
in connection therewith, is otherwise made in accordance with and subject to
the restrictions in this LLC Agreement. The Units shall be uncertificated.
The Company shall not, and the Managing Member shall not cause the Company
to, issue any Units if such issuance would result in the Company having more
than 100 partners, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the rules of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)); _provided_ that, for such purposes, the Company and

treated as a single partner within the meaning of Treasury Regulations

Law.

Effective Time. Immediately after the Effective Time, the Units will comprise

Units, comprising Series 1 RCUs and Series 2 RCUs. Except as otherwise
provided in this LLC Agreement, each outstanding Common Unit shall be
identical to each other Common Unit, each outstanding Series 1 RCU shall be

Unit shall be converted immediately and automatically, without any further
action on the part of the holder thereof or any other person (including the
Company and the Managing Member) into an equal number of Common Units, with
all rights and privileges of a Common Unit under this LLC Agreement from and
after the Conversion Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this LLC Agreement, if, upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event,
a filing is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 (" _HSR Act_ ") for the immediate conversion of any Restricted Common
Unit into an equal number of Common Units, then the Conversion Date with
respect to each such Restricted Common Unit shall be delayed until the earlier
of (i) such time as the required filing under the HSR Act has been made and
the waiting period applicable to such conversion under the HSR Act shall have
expired or been terminated or (ii) such filing is no longer required, at which
time such conversion shall automatically occur without any further action by
the holders of any such Restricted Common Unit. Each of the
Continuing Members and PubCo agree to promptly take all actions required to
make such filing under the HSR Act and the filing fee for such filing shall
be paid by the Company. On the Conversion Date with respect to any Restricted
Common Unit held by a Continuing Member, PubCo shall issue, for each
applicable Restricted Common Unit which has converted to a Common Unit under
this LLC Agreement, one share of Class V Common Stock to such Continuing
Member. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a subdivision or
combination referred to in _Section 4.1(i)(i)_ or _Section 4(i)(ii)_, the
number of shares of Class V Common Stock to which a Continuing Member shall
be entitled upon vesting of its Restricted Common Units shall equal the number
of Restricted Common Units held by the Continuing Members as a result of such
subdivision or combination that have converted into Common Units. PubCo
hereby agrees to reserve for issuance at all times an adequate number of
shares of Class V Common Stock to permit the issuance of all Class V Common
Stock assuming all of the Continuing Members' Restricted Common Units vest
under this LLC Agreement. To the extent that, on or before the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, a Vesting Event has not occurred with
respect to a Restricted Common Unit, and a Restricted Common Unit has not
vested and converted into a Common Unit under this LLC Agreement, then
immediately and without any further action under this LLC Agreement, on the
date that is the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any such
Restricted Common Units outstanding under this LLC Agreement shall be canceled
and extinguished for no consideration; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to
the Restricted Common Units held by PubCo, if a share of Class B Common Stock
to which a Restricted Common Unit relates is forfeited and canceled for no
consideration prior to such tenth (10th) anniversary in accordance with the
terms of issuance of such share of Class B Common Stock, such Restricted
Common Unit shall also be canceled and extinguished for no consideration,
such that, PubCo shall never hold more Restricted Common Units than
the number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at any time.

employee benefit plans of any warrants, options, stock appreciation right,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance based award or other

Security outstanding at the Company, if any, shall be similarly exercised or
otherwise converted, if applicable, (y) an equivalent number of Common Units
or equivalent Equity Securities of the Company shall be issued to PubCo as

liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
the Company, and (ii) such issuance is in accordance with _Section 4.1(e)_.

  



  

(h) _Repurchases and Redemptions_.

  



  

(i) Subject to _Section 4.1(h)(ii)_, PubCo or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) may redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire (A) shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant
to a Board approved repurchase plan or program (or otherwise in connection
with a transaction approved by the Board) and, substantially simultaneously
therewith, the Company shall redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire from
PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of Common Units for the same price
per security, if any, or (B) any other Equity Securities of PubCo or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) pursuant to a
Board approved repurchase plan or program (or otherwise in connection with a
transaction approved by the Board) and, substantially simultaneously
therewith, the Company shall redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire from
PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of the corresponding class or series
of Equity Securities of the Company with the same rights to dividends
and distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and other
economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of PubCo or such
Subsidiary for the same price per security, if any.

  



  

(ii) In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, or
take-over bid or similar transaction with respect to Class A Common Stock (a
" _PubCo Offer_ ") is proposed by PubCo or is proposed to PubCo or its
stockholders, the holders of Common Units shall be permitted to participate
in such PubCo Offer by delivery of an Exchange Notice (which Exchange
Notice shall be effective immediately prior to the consummation of such PubCo
Offer (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be contingent upon such PubCo
Offer and not be effective if such PubCo Offer is not consummated)). In the
case of a PubCo Offer proposed by PubCo, PubCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or
desirable to enable and permit the holders of Common Units to participate in
such PubCo Offer to the same extent or on an economically equivalent basis as
the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock without discrimination;
_provided_ that, without limiting the generality of this sentence (and
without limiting the ability of any Member holding Common Units to consummate
an Exchange at any time pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), the
Managing Member shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such
holders of Common Units may participate in such PubCo Offer without being
required to Exchange their Common Units and cancel their shares of Class
V Common Stock, as the case may be, (or, if so required, to ensure that any
such Exchange and cancelation shall be effective only upon, and shall be
conditional upon, the closing of the transactions contemplated by the PubCo
Offer). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the holders of Common
Units be entitled to receive in such PubCo Offer aggregate consideration for
each Common Unit and share of Class V Common Stock, taken together, that is
greater than or less than the consideration payable in respect of each share
of Class A Common Stock in connection with such PubCo Offer (it being
understood that payments under or in respect of the Tax Receivable Agreement
shall not be considered part of any such consideration).

(iii) The Company may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire
(x) any Common Units from PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries) unless substantially simultaneously PubCo or
such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires pursuant to a
Board approved repurchase plan or program (or otherwise in connection with a
transaction approved by the Board) an equal number of shares of Class A
Common Stock for the same price per security from holders thereof or (y)
any other Equity Securities of the Company from PubCo or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
unless substantially simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary redeems,
repurchases or otherwise acquires pursuant to a Board approved
repurchase plan or program (or otherwise in connection with a transaction
approved by the Board) for the same price per security an equal number of
Equity Securities of PubCo (or such Subsidiary) of a corresponding class or
series with substantially the same rights to dividends and distributions
(including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic rights as those
of such Equity Securities of PubCo or such Subsidiary.

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), to the
extent that any consideration payable by PubCo in connection with the
redemption, repurchase or acquisition of any shares of Class A Common Stock
or other Equity Securities of PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) consists (in whole or in part) of shares of
Class A Common Stock or such other Equity Securities (including in connection
with the cashless exercise of an option or warrant (or other convertible right
or security)) other than under PubCo's employee benefit plans for which there
is no corresponding Common Units or other Equity Securities of the Company,
then the redemption, repurchase or acquisition of the corresponding Common
Units or other Equity Securities of the Company shall be effectuated in an
equivalent manner.

  



  

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing set forth in this _Section
4.1(h)_ shall apply to any redemption effected pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_
hereof.

  



  

(i) _Equity Subdivisions and Combinations_.

  



  

(i) The Company shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by
any equity split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) or combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Units unless accompanied by
an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding
PubCo Common Stock or other related class or series of Equity Security of
PubCo, with corresponding changes made with respect to any other exchangeable
or convertible Equity Securities of the Company and PubCo.

  



  

   

\- 26 -

 



    



  

(ii) Except in accordance with _Section 4.6(c)_, PubCo shall not
in any manner effect any subdivision (by any equity split,
equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the outstanding PubCo Common Stock or any other class or series
of Equity Security of PubCo, unless accompanied by an identical subdivision
or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding Units or other related class
or series of Equity Security of the Company, with corresponding changes made
with respect to any applicable exchangeable or convertible Equity
Securities of the Company and PubCo.

  



  

(j) _General Authority_. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject
to _Sections 4.1(a)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ and  _(i)_ and
_Section 4.3_, the Company and PubCo (including in its capacity as the
Managing Member of the Company) shall be permitted to undertake all actions,
including an issuance, redemption, reclassification, distribution, division or
recapitalization, with respect to the Common Units or Restricted Common
Units, as applicable, to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio between (i)
the number of Common Units owned by PubCo, directly or indirectly, and the
number of outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) the number of
Series 1 RCUs owned by PubCo, directly or indirectly, and the number of
outstanding shares of Series B-1 Common Stock issued by PubCo, (iii) the
number of Series 2 RCUs owned by PubCo, directly or indirectly, and the
number of outstanding shares of Series B-2 Common Stock issued by PubCo, and
(iv) the number of outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock held by any
Person (other than PubCo) and the number of Common Units held by such Person
disregarding, for purposes of maintaining the one-to-one ratios in clauses
(i) and (ii), (A) options, rights or securities of PubCo issued under any
plan involving the issuance of any Equity Securities that are convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock, (B) treasury stock,
or (C) preferred stock or other debt or equity securities
(including warrants, options or rights) issued by PubCo that are convertible
or into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class A Common Stock (but in each
case prior to such conversion or exchange).

  



  

Section 4.2 _Capital Contributions_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
LLC Agreement, no Member shall be required to make additional
Capital Contributions to the Company.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Issuance of Additional Units_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this LLC Agreement (including _Section 4.1_ and this  _Section
4.3_), the Managing Member shall have the right to authorize and cause the
Company to issue on such terms (including price) as may be determined by the
Managing Member (a) additional Common Units or Equity Securities in the
Company having such rights, preferences and privileges as determined by the
Managing Member, which rights, preferences and privileges may be senior to
the Units, and (b) obligations, evidences of Indebtedness or other securities
or interests convertible or exchangeable for Units or other Equity Securities
in the Company; _provided_ that at any time following the date hereof, in each
case the Company shall not issue Equity Securities in the Company to any
Person other than PubCo or then-existing Members unless such Person shall
have executed a counterpart to this LLC Agreement and all other documents,
agreements or instruments deemed necessary or desirable as determined in good
faith by the Managing Member. Upon any such issuance and execution, (a) such
Person shall be admitted as a Member of the Company, and (b) the Managing
Member shall update the Company's books and records and amend _Exhibit A_ to
reflect such issuance. Subject to _Section 4.1_, this _Section 4.3_ and
_Section 12.1_, the Managing Member is hereby authorized to amend this LLC
Agreement to set forth the designations, preferences, rights, powers and
duties of such additional Common Units or other Equity Securities in the
Company authorized or issued pursuant to this _Section 4.3_.

Section 4.4 _Capital Accounts_. A Capital Account shall be maintained by the
Managing Member for each Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and, to the extent consistent with such
regulations, the other provisions of this LLC Agreement. Each Member's
Capital Account balance as of the Effective Time shall be equal to the amount
of its respective Closing Date Capital Account Balance set forth opposite
such Member's name on _Exhibit A_. Thereafter, each Member's Capital Account
shall be (a) increased by (i) allocations to such Member of Profits pursuant
to _Section 5.1_ and any other items of income or gain allocated to such
Member pursuant to _Section 5.2_, (ii) the amount of cash or the initial
Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of any Liabilities assumed by the Company
and any Liabilities to which the asset is subject) contributed to the Company
by such Member, and (iii) any other increases allowed or required by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and (b) decreased by (i) allocations
to such Member of Losses pursuant to _Section 5.1_ and any other items of
deduction or loss allocated to such Member pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 5.2_, (ii) the amount of any cash or the Gross Asset Value of any
asset (net of any Liabilities assumed by the Member and any Liabilities to
which the asset is subject) distributed to such Member, and (iii) any other
decreases allowed or required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). Upon the conversion of any Restricted Common Units into
Common Units upon a Vesting Event, the parties intend that the allocations
and capital maintenance rules shall be governed under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-3 with adjustments being made in accordance with principles
similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s) and consistent with the principles of Section 704(c) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in order to effectuate the
Members' agreed upon economic sharing of items within the Company. In the
event of a Transfer of Units made in accordance with this LLC Agreement
(including a deemed Transfer for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described
in _Section 4.6(i)_), the Capital Account of the Transferor that is
attributable to the Transferred Units shall carry over to the Transferee
Member in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l). This _Section 4.4_ and other provisions of this LLC
Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to
comply with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code Section 704(b),
including Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and shall be
interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury
Regulations. In determining the amount of any Liability for purposes of
calculating Capital Accounts, there shall be taken into account Section
752(c) of the Code and any other applicable provisions of the Code and
Treasury Regulations. The Members' Capital Accounts will normally be adjusted
on an annual or other periodic basis as determined by the Managing Member,
but the Capital Accounts may be adjusted more often if a new Member is
admitted to the Company or if circumstances otherwise make it advisable in
the judgment of the Managing Member.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Other Matters Regarding Capital Contributions_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall not be obligated to repay any Capital
Contributions of any Member. Under circumstances requiring a return of
any Capital Contributions, no Member has the right to receive property other
than cash.

  



  

   

\- 28 -

 



    



  

(b) No Member shall receive any interest, salary, compensation or
reimbursement with respect to its Capital Contributions or its
Capital Account, or for services rendered or expenses incurred on behalf of
the Company or otherwise in its capacity as a Member, except as otherwise
provided in _Section 7.8_ or other provisions of this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(c) A Member shall not be required to restore a deficit balance in
such Member's Capital Account, to lend any funds to the Company or to make
any additional contributions or payments to the Company.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Exchange of Common Units_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
_Section 4.6_, after the expiration of the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date
(the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), an Exchanging Member (together with its
Affiliates, including other Continuing Members, and Permitted Transferees) (x)
that is not Insight or any Affiliate or Permitted Transferee thereof shall be
entitled to cause the Company to effect an Exchange up to one (1) time per
calendar quarter collectively (and no more frequently), (y) that is Insight or
any Affiliate or Permitted Transferee thereof shall be entitled to cause the
Company to effect an Exchange up to two (2) times per calendar quarter
collectively (and no more frequently), in each case with respect to a number
of Common Units at least equal to or exceeding the Minimum Exchange Amount,
by delivering an Exchange Notice to the Company, with a copy to PubCo. Each
Exchange Notice shall be in the form set forth on _Exhibit B_ and shall
include all information required to be included therein. In the event that an
Exchange is being exercised in order to participate in a Piggyback
Registration, the Exchange Notice Date shall be prior to the expiration of
the time period in which a holder of securities is required to notify PubCo
that it wishes to participate in such Piggyback Registration in accordance
with _Section 3.2_ of the Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Within three (3) Business Days of the giving of an Exchange
Notice, the Managing Member may elect to settle all or a portion of
the Exchange in cash in an amount equal to the Cash Exchange Payment (in lieu
of shares of Class A Common Stock), exercisable by giving written notice of
such election to the Exchanging Member within such three (3) Business Day
period (such notice, the " _Cash Exchange Notice_ "). The Cash Exchange
Notice shall set forth the portion of the Common Units subject to the
Exchange which shall be exchanged for cash in lieu of Class A Common Stock. To
the extent such Exchange relates to the exercise of the Exchanging Member's
registration rights under _Section 4.1_ of the Investor Rights
Agreement, PubCo and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with such
Exchanging Member to exercise such Exchange in a manner which preserves such
Exchanging Member's rights thereunder. At any time following the giving of a
Cash Exchange Notice and prior to the Exchange Date, the Managing Member may
elect (exercisable by giving written notice of such election to the Exchanging
Member) to revoke the Cash Exchange Notice with respect to all or any portion
of the Exchanged Units and make the Stock Exchange Payment with respect to
any such Exchanged Units on the Exchange Date.

  



  

   

\- 29 -

 



    



  

(iii) In the event the Managing Member does not timely give a Cash
Exchange Notice (or revokes a Cash Exchange Notice in accordance with the
foregoing clause (ii)), the Exchanging Member may, if and only if any Exchange
Condition exists, elect to (x) retract its Exchange Notice or (y) delay the
consummation of an Exchange, in each case, exercisable by giving written
notice of such election to the Managing Member within two (2) Business Days
of the occurrence of an Exchange Condition and in any event no later than one
(1) Business Day prior to the Exchange Date (such notice under clause (y), an
" _Exchange Delay Notice_ ");  _provided_ that any such notice must specify
the particular Exchange Condition giving rise to such election. The giving
of any notice pursuant to clause (x) shall terminate all of the Exchanging
Member's, the Managing Member's and Company's rights and obligations under
this _Section 4.6_ arising from such retracted Exchange Notice, but shall not
count against the maximum number of Exchanges that an Exchanging Member may
effect in a calendar quarter.

  



  

(iv) In the event of a Continuing Member COC, the Managing Member
may elect, pursuant to a written notice given to the Members (other
than PubCo) at least thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of a
Continuing Member COC (a " _COC Notice_ "), to require each such Member to
effect an Exchange with respect to any portion of such Member's Common Units
(together with the surrender and cancellation of the corresponding number of
outstanding shares of Class V Common Stock held by such Member), taking into
account the conversion of such Member's Restricted Common Units into Common
Units as a result of any such Continuing Member COC (any such exchange, a "
_COC Exchange_ ") which shall be effective immediately prior to the
consummation of the Continuing Member COC (but such Exchange shall be
conditioned on the consummation of such Continuing Member COC, and shall not
be effective if such Continuing Member COC is not consummated) (the " _COC
Exchange Date_ "). In connection with a COC Exchange, such Exchange shall be
settled (including, if PubCo elects by delivery of a COC Notice, directly by
PubCo) (x) with the Stock Exchange Payment with respect to the Common Units
subject to the COC Exchange or (y) in cash or property, so long as in each
case each such Member receives the identical consideration, on a per Unit
basis, that the holder of a share of Class A Common Stock would receive in
connection with such Continuing Member COC.

  



  

(v) Restricted Common Units are not permitted to be treated as
Exchanged Units under this LLC Agreement, and in no event shall the Company
or PubCo effect an Exchange of a Restricted Common Unit unless and until a
Vesting Event and Conversion Date has occurred with respect to such
Restricted Common Unit and it has been converted to a Common Unit in
accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

(vi) For purposes of this _Section 4.6_ (and defined terms and
provisions related thereto), all decisions, determinations, elections and
other actions to be taken by the Managing Member or PubCo shall require the
approval of the Disinterested Majority.

  



  

   

\- 30 -

 



    



  

(b) _Exchange Payment_. The Exchange shall be consummated on the
Exchange Date. Unless PubCo has exercised its PubCo Call Right pursuant to 
_Section 4.6(f)_, on the Exchange Date (to be effective immediately prior to
the close of business on the Exchange Date) (i) PubCo shall contribute to the
Company for delivery to the Exchanging Member (x) the Stock Exchange Payment
with respect to any Exchanged Units not subject to a Cash Exchange Notice and
(y) the Cash Exchange Payment with respect to any Exchanged Units subject to
a Cash Exchange Notice, (ii) the Exchanging Member shall transfer and
surrender the Exchanged Units to the Company, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, (iii) the Company shall issue to PubCo a number of Common Units
equal to the number of Common Units surrendered pursuant to clause (ii), (iv)
solely to the extent necessary in connection with an Exchange, PubCo shall
undertake all actions, including an issuance, reclassification, distribution,
division or recapitalization, with respect to the Class A Common Stock to
maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of Common Units owned by
PubCo, directly or indirectly, and the number of outstanding shares of Class
A Common Stock, taking into account the issuance in clause (iii), any Stock
Exchange Payment, and any other action taken in connection with this _Section
4.6_, (v) the Company shall (x) cancel the redeemed Common Units which were
Exchanged Units held by the Exchanging Member and (y) transfer to the
Exchanging Member the Cash Exchange Payment and/or the Stock Exchange Payment,
as applicable, and (vi) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class V
Common Stock. On or prior to the Exchange Date, and as a condition to the
Exchange, the Exchanging Member shall make any applicable Certificate
Delivery. Upon the Exchange of all of a Member's Units, such Member shall
cease to be a Member of the Company.

  



  

(c) _Splits, Distributions and Reclassifications_. If there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the shares of Class A Common Stock are converted or
changed into another security, securities or other property, this _Section
4.6_ shall continue to be applicable, _mutatis mutandis_ , with respect to
such security or other property. This _Section 4.6(c)_ is intended to
preserve the intended economic effect of _Section 4.1_ and this _Section
4.6_ and to put each Member in the same economic position, to the greatest
extent possible, with respect to Exchanges as if such
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction had not occurred and shall be interpreted in a manner
consistent with such intent.

  



  

(d) _PubCo Covenants_. PubCo shall at all times keep available,
solely for the purpose of issuance upon an Exchange, out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, such number of shares
of Class A Common Stock that shall be issuable upon the Exchange of all
outstanding Common Units and Restricted Common Units (other than those Common
Units and Restricted Common Units held by PubCo or any Subsidiary of PubCo);
_provided_ that nothing contained in this LLC Agreement shall be construed to
preclude PubCo from satisfying its obligations with respect to an Exchange by
delivery of a Cash Exchange Payment or shares of Class A Common Stock that
are held in treasury of PubCo. PubCo covenants that all shares of Class A
Common Stock that shall be issued upon an Exchange shall, upon issuance
thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances. In addition, for so long as the shares of Class A
Common Stock are listed on a stock exchange or automated or electronic
quotation system, PubCo shall cause all shares of Class A Common Stock issued
upon an Exchange to be listed on such stock exchange or automated or
electronic quotation system at the time of such issuance. For purposes of this
_Section 4.6(d)_, references to the " _Class A Common Stock_" shall be
deemed to include any Equity Securities issued or issuable as a result of any
reclassification, combination, subdivision or similar transaction of the Class
A Common Stock that any Member would be entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 4.6(c)_.

  



  

   

\- 31 -

 



    



  

(e) _Exchange Taxes_. The issuance of shares of Class A Common
Stock upon an Exchange shall be made without charge to the Exchanging Member
for any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that of the Exchanging Member (subject to the
restrictions in  _Article IX_), then the Person or Persons in whose name the
shares are to be issued shall pay to PubCo the amount of any additional tax
that may be payable in respect of any Transfer involved in such issuance in
excess of the amount otherwise due if such shares were issued in the name of
the Exchanging Member or shall establish to the satisfaction of PubCo that
such additional tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(f) _PubCo Call Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 4.6_, with respect to any Exchange Notice or COC
Notice, an Exchanging Member shall be deemed to have offered to sell its
Exchanged Units as described in any Exchange Notice directly to PubCo (rather
than to the Company), and PubCo may, by delivery of a written notice to the
Exchanging Member no later than three (3) Business Days following the giving
of an Exchange Notice, in accordance with, and subject to the terms of, this
_Section 4.6(f)_ (such notice, a " _PubCo Call Notice_ "), elect to purchase
directly and acquire such Exchanged Units on the Exchange Date by paying to
the Exchanging Member (or such other Person specified in the Exchange Notice)
the Stock Exchange Payment and/or the Cash Exchange Payment, whereupon PubCo
shall acquire the Exchanged Units on the Exchange Date and be treated for all
purposes of this LLC Agreement as the owner of such Common Units. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 4.6(f)_, an exercise of the PubCo Call
Right shall be consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same
manner as the relevant Exchange would have been consummated if PubCo had not
given a PubCo Call Notice, in each case as relevant, including that _Section
4.6(a)(ii)_ shall apply mutatis mutandis and that clauses (iv) and (vi) of
_Section 4.6(b)_ shall apply (notwithstanding that the other clauses thereof
do not apply).

  



  

(g) _Distribution Rights_. No Exchange shall impair the right of
the Exchanging Member to receive any distributions payable on the Common
Units redeemed pursuant to such Exchange in respect of a record date that
occurs prior to the Exchange Date for such Exchange. No Exchanging Member, or
a Person designated by an Exchanging Member to receive shares of Class A
Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such record date,
distributions or dividends both on Common Units redeemed by the Company from
such Exchanging Member and on shares of Class A Common Stock received by such
Exchanging Member, or other Person so designated, if applicable, in such
Exchange.

  



  

(h) _Exchange Restrictions_. The Managing Member may impose
additional limitations and restrictions on Exchanges (including limiting
Exchanges or creating priority procedures for Exchanges) to the extent it
reasonably determines in good faith that such limitations and
restrictions are necessary to avoid the Company being classified as a "
_publicly traded partnership_ " within the meaning of Section 7704 of the
Code; _provided_ that, for such purposes, the Company and the Managing Member
shall assume that each Continuing Member is treated as a single partner
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)
(determined taking into account the rules of Treasury Regulations Section
1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

   

\- 32 -

 



    



  

(i) _Tax Matters_. In connection with any Exchange or COC Notice,
the Exchanging Member shall deliver to PubCo or the Company, as applicable, a
certificate, dated as of the Exchange Date and sworn under penalties of
perjury, in a form reasonably acceptable to PubCo or the Company, as
applicable, certifying as to such Exchanging Member's taxpayer identification
number and that such Exchanging Member is a not a foreign person for purposes
of Section 1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code (which certificate may be an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 if then sufficient for such purposes under
applicable Law). For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes, each of the Exchanging Member, the Company and PubCo agree to treat
each Exchange as a sale by the Exchanging Member of the Exchanging Member's
Common Units (together with an equal number of shares of Class V Common
Stock, which shares shall not be allocated any economic value) to PubCo in
exchange for the payment by PubCo of the Stock Exchange Payment, the Cash
Exchange Payment, or other applicable consideration to the Exchanging Member.

  



  

(j) _Representations and Warranties_. In connection with any
Exchange or exercise of a PubCo Call Right, (i) upon the acceptance of the
Class A Common Stock or an amount of cash equal to the Cash Exchange Payment,
the Exchanging Member shall represent and warrant that the Exchanging Member
is the owner of the number of Common Units that the Exchanging Member is
electing to Exchange and that such Common Units are not subject to any liens
or restrictions on transfer (other than restrictions imposed by this LLC
Agreement, the charter and governing documents of PubCo and applicable Law),
and (ii) if the Managing Member elects a Stock Exchange Payment, the Managing
Member shall represent that (A) the shares of Class A Common Stock issued to
the Exchanging Member in settlement of the Stock Exchange Payment are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were issued in
compliance in all material respects with applicable securities laws, and (B)
the issuance of such shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Exchanging
Member in settlement of the Stock Exchange Payment does not conflict with or
result in any breach of the organizational documents of PubCo.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Representations and Warranties of the Members_. Each Member who
acquires Units after the Effective Time severally (and not jointly)
represents and warrants to the Company and each other Member as of the date
of such Member's admittance to the Company and as of each subsequent date
that such Member acquires any additional Units (other than, in the case of
acquisition of additional Units, _Section 4.7(b)_ to the extent any conflict
under _Section 4.7(b)_ is related to the occurrence of a Change of Control
resulting from such acquisition) that:

  



  

(a) _Organization; Authority_.

  



  

(i) To the extent it is not a natural person, (x) it is duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing (if applicable) under the Laws
of the jurisdiction of its formation, and if required by Law is duly qualified
to conduct business and is in good standing in the jurisdiction of its
principal place of business (if not formed in such jurisdiction), and (y) has
full corporate, limited liability company, partnership, trust or other
applicable power and authority to execute and deliver this LLC Agreement and
to perform its obligations under this LLC Agreement and all necessary actions
by the board of directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners,
trustees, beneficiaries or other Persons necessary for the due authorization,
execution, delivery and performance of this LLC Agreement by that Member have
been duly taken.

  



  

   

\- 33 -

 



    



  

(ii) It has duly executed and delivered this LLC Agreement, and
this LLC Agreement is enforceable against such Member in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency and other Laws generally
affecting creditors' rights and general principles of equity (whether applied
in a proceeding in a court of law or equity).

  



  

(b) _Non-Contravention_.

ARTICLE V 
 ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

  



  

Section 5.1 _Profits and Losses_. After giving effect to the allocations
under _Section 5.2_ and subject to _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.4_,
Profits and Losses (and, to the extent reasonably determined by the Managing
Member to be necessary and appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital
Account balances described below, any allocable items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit includable in the computation of Profits and Losses) for
each Taxable Year or other taxable period shall be allocated among the
Members during such Taxable Year or other taxable period in a manner such
that, after giving effect to all distributions through the end of such
Taxable Year or other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of each
Member, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible,
equal to (a) the amount such Member would receive pursuant to _Section
11.3(b)(iii)_ if all assets of the Company on hand at the end of such Taxable
Year or other taxable period were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset
Values, all liabilities of the Company were satisfied in cash in accordance
with their terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse liability to the
Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability), and all remaining or
resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)(iii)_,
to the Members immediately after making such allocation, minus (b) such
Member's share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain, computed
immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, and (without
duplication) the amount any such Member is treated as obligated to contribute
to the Company, computed immediately after the hypothetical sale of assets.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Special Allocations_.

  



  

(a) Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other taxable
period shall be specially allocated to the Members on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the number of Common Units owned by each Member. The amount
of Nonrecourse Deductions for a Taxable Year or other taxable period shall
equal the excess, if any, of the net increase, if any, in the amount of
Company Minimum Gain during that Taxable Year or other taxable period over
the aggregate amount of any distributions during that Taxable Year or other
taxable period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are allocable to
an increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations _Section 1.704-2(d)_.

  



  

   

\- 35 -

 



    



  

(b) Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Taxable Year or other
taxable period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears economic
risk of loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member
Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Treasury
Regulations _Section 1.704-2(i)_. If more than one (1) Member bears the
economic risk of loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the Member
Nonrecourse Deductions attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be
allocated among the Members according to the ratio in which they bear the
economic risk of loss. This _Section 5.2(b)_ is intended to comply with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this LLC Agreement to
the contrary, if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any
Taxable Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in
Company Minimum Gain for a prior Taxable Year or other taxable period and the
Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior
periods to allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2(c)_), each
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such
Taxable Year or other taxable period in an amount equal to such Member's
share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (as
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This
_Section 5.2(c)_ is intended to constitute a minimum gain chargeback under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this LLC Agreement
except _Section 5.2(c)_, if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum
Gain during any Taxable Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net
decrease in Member Minimum Gain for a prior Taxable Year or other taxable
period and the Company did not have sufficient amounts of income and gain
during prior periods to allocate among the Members under this _Section 5.2
(d)_), each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and
gain for such year in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net
decrease in Member Minimum Gain (as determined pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)). This _Section 5.2(d)_ is intended to
constitute a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, no Losses or other items of loss or
expense shall be allocated to any Member to the extent that such allocation
would cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or
increase any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such
Taxable Year or other taxable period. All Losses and other items of loss and
expense in excess of the limitation set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_
shall be allocated to the Members who do not have an Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit in proportion to their relative positive Capital Accounts but only to
the extent that such Losses and other items of loss and expense do not cause
any such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

  



  

   

\- 36 -

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except
_Section 5.2(c)_ and _Section 5.2(d)_, in the event any Member unexpectedly
receives any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in paragraph
(4), (5) or (6) of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), items
of income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of income,
including gross income, and gain for the Taxable Year or other taxable
period) shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of that Member as
quickly as possible; _provided_ that an allocation pursuant to this _Section
5.2(f)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would
have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided
for in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been tentatively made as if
this _Section 5.2(f)_ were not in this LLC Agreement. This _Section 5.2(f)_
is intended to constitute a qualified income offset under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

  



  

(g) If any Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at
the end of any Taxable Year or other taxable period that is in excess of the
amount that the Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the
penultimate sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and
(i)(5), that Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and
gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ that an
allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall be made only if and to
the extent that such Member would have a deficit balance in its Capital
Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been made as if _Section 5.2(f)_
and this _Section 5.2(g)_ were not in this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(h) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Company asset pursuant to Code Sections 734(b) or 743(b) is required,
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1 (b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts as a result of a distribution to any Member in complete or partial
liquidation of such Member's Units in the Company, the amount of such
adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if
the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
decreases such basis) and such item of gain or loss shall be allocated to the
Members in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) if such Section applies or to the Member to whom such
distribution was made if Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4)
applies.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this LLC
Agreement, (1) no allocation (of Profits or Losses or otherwise) shall be
made in respect of any Restricted Common Units in determining Capital
Accounts unless and until such Restricted Common Units are converted into
Common Units upon the occurrence of a Vesting Event and (2) in the event the
Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to _clause
(b)(vi)_ of the definition of Gross Asset Value, any Profits or Losses
resulting from such adjustment shall, in the manner reasonably determined by
the Managing Member, be allocated among the Members (including the
Members who held the Restricted Common Units giving rise to such adjustment)
such that the Capital Account balance relating to each Common Unit (including
such Restricted Common Units that have been converted into Common Units) is
equal in amount immediately after making such allocation, after taking into
account the Distribution Catch-Up Payment, in accordance with principles
similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); _provided_ , that if the foregoing allocations pursuant
to clause (2) are insufficient to cause the Capital Account balance relating
to each Common Unit to be so equal in amount, then the Managing Member, in
its reasonable discretion, shall cause a Capital Account reallocation in
accordance with principles similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3) to cause the Capital Account balance
relating to each Common Unit to be so equal in amount.

  



  

   

\- 37 -

 



    



  

(j) The allocations set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ through
_5.2(h)_ (the " _Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with
certain requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article V_ (other than the
Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future
Regulatory Allocations) shall be taken into account in allocating other items
of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent
possible, the net amount of such allocation of other items and the Regulatory
Allocations to each Member should be equal to the net amount that would have
been allocated to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not
occurred. In general, the Members anticipate that this shall be accomplished
by specially allocating other Profits and Loss among the Members so that the
net amount of Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each such
Member is zero. This _Section 5.2(j)_ is intended to minimize to the extent
possible and to the extent necessary any economic distortions that may result
from application of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent therewith.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Allocations for Tax Purposes in General_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.3_, each item
of income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company for U.S. federal income
tax purposes shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as such
item is allocated under _Sections 5.1_  and _5.2_.

  



  

(b) In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (including the Treasury Regulations applying the
principles of Code Section 704(c) to changes in Gross Asset Values), items of
income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any Company property having
a Gross Asset Value that differs from such property's adjusted U.S. federal
income tax basis shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be
allocated among the Members to account for any such difference using (i) with
respect to any such differences that exist at the Effective Time, the "
_traditional method_ " without curative allocations under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) and (ii) with respect to any other
such differences, any other permissible method or methods determined by the
Managing Member to be appropriate and in accordance with the applicable
Treasury Regulations.

  



  

(c) Any (i) recapture of depreciation or any other item of
deduction shall be allocated, in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.1245-1(e) and 1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of
such deductions and (ii) tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items
related thereto shall be allocated to the Members according to their interests
in such items as reasonably determined by the Managing Member taking into
account the principles of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii),
1.704-1(b)(3)(iv), and 1.704-1(b)(4)(viii).

  



  

(d) Allocations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ are solely for
purposes of U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and shall not
affect or in any way be taken into account in computing any Member's Capital
Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to
any provision of this LLC Agreement.

  



  

   

\- 38 -

 



    



  

(e) If, as a result of an exercise of a non-compensatory option to
acquire an interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation
is required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the
Company shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x). If, pursuant to _Section 5.2(i)_, the Managing
Member causes a Capital Account reallocation in accordance with principles
similar to those set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the Managing Member shall make corrective
allocations in accordance with principles similar to those set forth in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

  



  

(f) Any adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of Company property
pursuant to Code Section 743(b) resulting from a transfer of Units shall be
handled in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.743-1(j).

  



  

Section 5.4 _Other Allocation Rules_.

  



  

(a) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the
allocations made by this _Article V_ and the economic impact of the
allocations on the amounts receivable by them under this LLC Agreement. The
Members hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this _Article V_ in
reporting their share of Company income and loss for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes.

  



  

(b) The provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance for
each Member of a Capital Account as provided by _Section 4.4_ and the
allocations set forth in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.3_ are intended to
comply with the Treasury Regulations and to reflect the intended economic
entitlement of the Members. If the Managing Member reasonably determines that
the application of the provisions in _Sections 4.4_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.3_
would result in non-compliance with the Treasury Regulations or would be
inconsistent with the intended economic entitlement of the Members, the
Managing Member is authorized to make any appropriate adjustments to such
provisions to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including to allocate
properly items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit to those Members
who bear the economic burden or benefit associated therewith, or to otherwise
cause the Members to achieve the economic objectives underlying this LLC
Agreement and the Business Combination Agreement. The Managing Member also
shall (i) make any adjustments that it reasonably determines are necessary or
appropriate to maintain equality between the Capital Accounts of the Members
and the amount of Company capital reflected on the Company's balance sheet,
as computed for book purposes, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(iv)(g) and (ii) make any reasonable and appropriate modifications
in the event unanticipated events would reasonably be expected to otherwise
cause this LLC Agreement not to comply with Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b).

  



  

(c) With regard to PubCo's acquisition of the Pro Forma Buyer
Common Units and Pro Forma Buyer Restricted Common Units, Profits or Losses
shall be allocated to the Members of the Company so as to take into account
the varying interests of the Members in the Company using an "interim closing
of the books" method in a manner that complies with the provisions of Section
706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. If during any
Taxable Year there is any other change in any Member's Units in the Company,
the Managing Member shall allocate the Profits or Losses to the Members of the
Company so as to take into account the varying interests of the Members in
the Company using an "interim closing of the books" method in a manner that
complies with the provisions of Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such allocations may
instead be made in another manner that complies with the provisions of Section
706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that is selected
by the Managing Member in its reasonable good faith discretion.

  



  

   

\- 39 -

 



    



  

(d) Solely for purposes of determining a Member's proportionate
share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Company, within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Managing Member
shall allocate such liabilities in such manner that complies with the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and that the Managing Member
reasonably determines, in a manner intended to minimize any gain of the
Members to the greatest extent possible under Section 731 of the Code.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Restricted Common Units_. The Parties intend that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (a) the Restricted Common Units received by the
Continuing Members and by PubCo in connection with the Business Combination
Agreement not be treated as being received in connection with the performance
of services and (b) no such Member be treated as having taxable income or gain
as a result of such receipt of such Restricted Common Units or as a result of
holding any such Restricted Common Units at the time of any Vesting Event
(other than as a result of corrective allocations made pursuant to _Section
5.2(i)_) and the Company shall prepare and file all tax returns consistent
therewith unless otherwise required by a " _determination_ " within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
 DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

Section 6.1 _Distributions_.

  



  

(a) _Distributions_.

  



  

(i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, distributions to
Members may be declared by the Managing Member out of Distributable Cash in
such amounts, at such time and on such terms (including the payment dates of
such distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine using such record
date as the Managing Member may designate. All distributions made under this
_Section 6.1(a)_ shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on
such record date on a _pro rata_ basis (except that, for the avoidance of
doubt, repurchases or redemptions made in accordance with _Section 4.1(g)_,
_Section 6.2(b)_ or payments made in accordance with _Section 7.4_ or
_Section 7.8_ need not be on a _pro rata_ basis, as long as such payments
are otherwise made in accordance with the terms of this LLC Agreement) in
accordance with each Member's percentage interest in the Company as of the
close of business on such record date; _provided_ , that the Managing Member
shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth in _Section
6.2_ and _Section 11.3(b)(iii)_; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no distributions
shall be made to any Member to the extent such distribution would render the
Company insolvent or violate the Act. For purposes of this _Section 6.1(a)_
and  _Section 6.2(a)_, insolvent means the inability of the Company to meet
its payment obligations when due.

  



  

   

\- 40 -

 



    



   



  

(ii) Promptly following the designation of a record date and the
declaration of a distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.1(a)_,
the Managing Member shall give notice to each Member of the record date, the
amount and the terms of the distribution and the payment date thereof.

  

  



  

(iii) No Restricted Common Unit shall be entitled to receive any
distributions pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_; _provided_ , that, no later than
five (5) Business Days following the Conversion Date with respect to a
Restricted Common Unit, for each Restricted Common Unit for which the Vesting
Event has occurred, the Company shall pay to the holder of such Restricted
Common Unit an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate per Common Unit amount
of distributions actually paid pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_ (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding any Tax Distributions) during the Distribution
Catch-Up Period relevant to such Restricted Common Unit (and if any in-kind
distribution was made during the Distribution Catch-Up Period, (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this LLC Agreement, shall not include any
transaction subject to _Section 4.1(i)_ or _4.1(h)_ hereof) to the extent
feasible (and not requiring any approval (including at PubCo) other than that
of the Managing Member in its capacity as such) identical property, or if not
feasible (or if requiring any such approval) an amount in cash equal to the
greater of the per Common Unit Fair Market Value of such in-kind distribution
(x) at the time such distribution was made and (y) at the time such
Distribution Catch-Up Payment is made) (each such distribution, a "
_Distribution Catch-Up Payment_ "). To the extent that the Conversion Date in
respect of a Restricted Common Unit occurs following the date that a
distribution is declared under this _Section 6.1(a)_, but on or before the
date such distribution is paid, the amount distributable on each Unit in such
distribution shall not be included in the Distribution Catch-Up Payment, and
such holder of such Restricted Common Unit shall be entitled to receive such
distribution when paid to the holders of Common Units, assuming such holder
continues to hold a Common Unit on the record date with respect to such
distribution.

  



  

(b) _Successors_. For purposes of determining the amount of
distributions (including Tax Distributions), each Member shall be treated as
having made the Capital Contributions made by, been allocated the net taxable
income of the Company (in accordance with the definition of Tier 1 Tax
Amount) allocated to, and received the distributions made to or received by
its predecessors in respect of any of such Member's Units.

  



  

(c) _Distributions In-Kind_. Except as otherwise provided in this
LLC Agreement, any distributions may be made in cash or in kind, or partly
in cash and partly in kind, as reasonably determined by the Managing Member.
In the event of any distribution of (i) property in kind or (ii) both cash
and property in kind, each Member shall be distributed its proportionate share
of any such cash so distributed and its proportionate share of any such
property so distributed in kind (based on the Fair Market Value of
such property). To the extent that the Company distributes property in-kind
to the Members, the Company shall be treated as making a distribution equal
to the Fair Market Value of such property for purposes of _Section 6.1(a)_
and such property shall be treated as if it were sold for an amount equal to
its Fair Market Value; _provided_ that none of the following shall be a
distribution for purposes of this LLC Agreement: (a) any recapitalization that
does not result in the distribution of cash or property to Members or any
exchange of securities of the Company, and any subdivision (by Unit split or
otherwise) or any combination (by reverse Unit split or otherwise) of any
outstanding Units or (b) any other payment made by the Company to a Member
that is not properly treated as a "distribution" for purposes of Sections 731,
732, or 733 or other applicable provisions of the Code. Any resulting gain or
loss shall be allocated to the Member's Capital Accounts in accordance with 
_Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_.

Section 6.2 _Tax-Related Distributions_.

  



  

(a) Effective upon the Effective Time, prior to making any other
distributions under this LLC Agreement, on each Tax Distribution Date,
unless prohibited by applicable Law, the Managing Member shall cause the
Company, from available cash, available borrowings and other funds legally
available therefor, including legally made distributions from available cash
of the Company's Subsidiaries (taking into account any restrictions
applicable to tax distributions contained in the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' then applicable bank financing agreements by which the Company
or its Subsidiaries are bound) (collectively, " _Cash Available For Tax
Distributions_ ") to make distributions of cash (each, a " _Tax Distribution_
") to the Members holding Common Units, pro rata in proportion to their
respective number of Common Units in an amount such that the Member with the
highest Tier 1 Tax Amount per Common Unit receives an amount equal to such
Member's Tier 1 Tax Amount; _provided_ , that if the amount of Tax
Distributions actually made with respect to a quarter or a Taxable Year is
greater than or less than the Tax Distributions that would have been made
under this _Section 6.2_ for such period based on subsequent tax
information and assuming no limitations based on prohibitions under
applicable Law, Cash Available For Tax Distributions, or insolvency
under this _Section 6.2_ (such limitations, the " _Liquidity Limitations_ ")
(e.g., because the estimated Tax Distributions for a Taxable Year were
greater than or less than the amount calculated based on actual taxable income
for such Taxable Year or because such Tax Distribution would have rendered
the Company insolvent (as defined in _Section 6.1(a)_)), then, on subsequent
Tax Distribution Dates, starting with the next Tax Distribution Date, and
prior to any additional distributions pursuant to _Section 6.1_, the
Managing Member shall, subject to the Liquidity Limitations, cause the Company
to adjust the next Tax Distribution and subsequent Tax Distributions downward
(but not below zero) or upward (but in any event pro rata in proportion to
the Members' respective number of Common Units) to reflect such excess or
shortfall; and _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding any other
provision in this LLC Agreement to the contrary, (A) Tax Distributions shall
not be required to the extent any such distribution would render the Company
insolvent (as defined in _Section 6.1(a)_), and (B) the Managing Member
shall not be required to cause the Company to make any Tax Distributions on
any date other than a Tax Distribution Date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, (a) the Managing Member shall make,
in its reasonable discretion, equitable adjustments (downward (but not below
zero) or upward) to the Members' Tax Distributions (but in any event pro rata
in proportion to the Members' respective number of Common Units) to take into
account increases or decreases in the number of Common Units held by each
Member during the relevant period (including as a result of conversion of any
Restricted Common Units into Common Units in connection with the occurrence of
a Vesting Event); _provided_ that no such adjustments shall be made that
would have a material adverse effect on the Continuing Members without the
Continuing Member Representative's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and (b) no Tax
Distributions (or downward (but not below zero) or upward adjustment to any
Tax Distributions) shall be made other than on a pro rata basis in proportion
to the Members' respective number of Common Units.

(b) In addition to the foregoing, with respect any Tax
Distribution Date, to the extent the Tier 2 Tax Amount with respect to any
Member exceeds the Tier 1 Tax Amount with respect to such Member (such
excess, the " _Available Amount_ "), then to the extent such Member provides
written notice to the Company at least ten (10) days prior to such Tax
Distribution Date (a " _Tax Distribution Request_ ") and subject to the
Liquidity Limitations, the Managing Member shall cause the Company, from Cash
Available for Tax Distributions, to increase distributions of cash to such
Member on such Tax Distribution Date up to an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) the amount specified on the applicable Tax Distribution Request and (ii)
the Available Amount with respect to such Member for such Tax Distribution
Date (the amount of cash so distributed, the " _Excess Tax Distribution
Amount_ "), in complete redemption of a number of Common Units held by such
Member equal to (x) the Excess Tax Distribution Amount divided by (y) a price
per Common Unit as of the applicable Tax Distribution Date determined in
accordance with the principles set forth in the definition of "Cash Exchange
Payment" (the " _Price Per Common Unit_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no Member shall be entitled to receive any cash
distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_ in excess of the aggregate
Price Per Common Unit with respect to all Common Units held by such Member as
of immediately prior to such distribution (and in such case, in connection
with the redemption of all such Common Units). In connection with any
redemption of Common Units pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)_, (A) the
applicable Member shall (I) transfer and surrender the applicable number of
Common Units to the Company, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and
(II) surrender the corresponding number of outstanding shares of Class V
Common Stock held by such Member, (B) the Company shall cancel the redeemed
Common Units and (C) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class
V Common Stock, in each case for no consideration other than the Excess Tax
Distribution Amount.

  

  



  

Section 6.3 _Distribution Upon Withdrawal_. No withdrawing Member shall be
entitled to receive any distribution or the value of such Member's Units in
the Company as a result of withdrawal from the Company prior to the
liquidation of the Company, except as provided in this LLC Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
 MANAGEMENT

  



  

Section 7.1 _Managing Member Rights; Member and Officer Duties_.

  



  

(a) PubCo shall be the sole Managing Member of the Company and,
pursuant to the governing documents of PubCo, the business and affairs
of PubCo shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Except as
otherwise required by Law or provided in this LLC Agreement, (i) the Managing
Member shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the Company, (ii)
the management and control of the Company's business activities and
operations shall rest exclusively with the Managing Member, and (iii) the
Members, other than the Managing Member (in its capacity as such), shall not
participate in the control, management, direction or operation of the
activities or affairs of the Company and shall have no power to act for or
bind the Company. Nothing set forth in this LLC Agreement shall reduce or
restrict the rights set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof.

  



  

   

\- 43 -

 



    



  

(b) Except as otherwise required by the Act, no current or former
Member (including a current or former Managing Member) or any current
or former Officer shall be obligated personally for any Liability of the
Company solely by reason of being a Member or, with respect to the Managing
Member, acting as Managing Member of the Company, or, with respect to an
Officer, acting in his or her capacity as an Officer. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this LLC Agreement, the failure of the
Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise
of its powers or management of its business and affairs under this
LLC Agreement or the Act shall not be grounds for imposing personal liability
on the Managing Member for liabilities of the Company.

  

  



  

(c) In connection with the performance of its duties as the
Managing Member of the Company, the Managing Member (solely in its
capacity as such) will owe to the other Members the same fiduciary duties as
it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware corporation if it were a
member of the board of directors of such a corporation and the other Members
were stockholders of such corporation. To the extent that, at Law or in
equity, any Subsidiary of the Company or any manager, director (or
equivalent), officer, employee or agent of any Subsidiary of the Company has
duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, to a Member (other than
the Managing Member) or to any Person who acquires Units, all such duties
(including fiduciary duties) are hereby limited solely to those expressly set
forth in this Agreement (if any), to the fullest extent permitted by Law. The
limitation of duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, each Member
(other than the Managing Member) and any Person who acquires Units set forth
in the preceding sentence is approved by the Company, each Member and any
Person who acquires Units.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Role of Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Managing Member may appoint, employ or otherwise contract
with any Person for the transaction of the business of the Company or the
performance of services for or on behalf of the Company, and the Managing
Member may delegate to any such Persons such authority to act on behalf of
the Company as the Managing Member may from time to time deem appropriate.

  



  

(b) The Officers of the Company as of the Effective Time are set
forth on _Exhibit C_ attached hereto.

  



  

(c) The Managing Member shall appoint a Chief Executive Officer
who will be responsible for the general and active management of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Chief Executive Officer
will report to the Managing Member and have the general powers and duties of
management usually vested in the office of chief executive officer of a
corporation organized under the DGCL, subject to the terms of this LLC
Agreement and as may be prescribed by the Managing Member, and will have such
other powers and duties as may be reasonably prescribed by the Managing
Member or set forth in this LLC Agreement. The Chief Executive Officer will
have the power to execute bonds, mortgages and other contracts requiring a
seal, under the seal of the Company, except where required or permitted by
Law to be otherwise signed and executed, and except where the signing and
execution thereof is delegated by the Managing Member to some other Officer
or agent of the Company.

  



  

   

\- 44 -

 



    



  

(d) Except as set forth in this LLC Agreement, the Managing Member
may appoint Officers at any time, and the Officers may include, in
addition to the Chief Executive Officer, a president, one or more vice
presidents, a secretary, one or more assistant secretaries, a chief financial
officer, a general counsel, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, a
chief operating officer, an executive chairman, and any other officers that
the Managing Member deems appropriate. Except as set forth in this LLC
Agreement, the Officers will serve at the pleasure of the Managing Member,
subject to all rights, if any, of such Officer under any contract of
employment. Any individual may hold any number of offices, and an Officer
may, but need not, be a Member of the Company. The Officers will exercise
such powers and perform such duties as specified in this LLC Agreement or as
reasonably determined from time to time by the Managing Member.

  

  



  

(e) Subject to this LLC Agreement and to the rights, if any, of an
Officer under a contract of employment, any Officer may be removed,
either with or without cause, by the Managing Member. Any Officer may resign
at any time by giving written notice to the Managing Member. Any resignation
will take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later
time specified in that notice and, unless otherwise specified in that notice,
the acceptance of the resignation will not be necessary to make it effective.
Any resignation is without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company
under any contract to which the Officer is a party. A vacancy in any office
because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause
will be filled in the manner prescribed in this LLC Agreement for regular
appointments to that office.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Warranted Reliance by Officers on Others_. In exercising their
authority and performing their duties under this LLC Agreement, the Officers
shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements of
the following Persons or groups unless they have actual knowledge concerning
the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted:

  



  

(a) one or more employees or other agents of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whom the Officer reasonably believes to be reliable and
competent in the matters presented; and

  



  

(b) any attorney, public accountant, or other Person as to matters
which the Officer reasonably believes to be within such Person's professional
or expert competence.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each Person who was or is made a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise subject to or
involved in any Action, by reason of the fact that he, she or it is or was a
Member (including the Managing Member), is or was serving as the Company
Representative (including any " _designated individual_ ") or the Continuing
Member Representative or an officer, manager or director (or equivalent) or,
at the discretion of the Managing Member, any employee or agent, of the
Managing Member, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was an
officer, manager or director (or equivalent) or, at the discretion of the
Managing Member, any employee or agent, of the Managing Member, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries serving at the request of the Managing Member or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an officer, manager or director
(or equivalent) or, at the discretion of the Managing Member, any employee or
agent, of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other entity or which relates to or arises out of the
property, business or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _Indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such Action is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, manager, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as an officer, manager, director, employee or agent,
shall be indemnified by the Company against all expense, Liability and loss
(including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ ");  _provided_
, _however_ , that, such Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification
if such Indemnitee's conduct constituted fraud or a knowing violation of Law;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , except as provided in _Section 7.4(d)_
with respect to Actions to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company
shall indemnify any such Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in
connection with an Action (or part thereof but excluding any compulsory
counterclaim) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Action (or part
thereof but excluding any compulsory counterclaim) was authorized by the
Board.

  



  

   

\- 45 -

 



    



  

(b) _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. The right to
indemnification conferred in _Section 7.4(a)_ shall include the right to
advancement by the Company of any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees
and expenses) incurred in participating in or defending any such Action in
advance of its final disposition (an " _Advancement of Expenses_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee shall be made pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ only upon
delivery to the Company of an undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay, without interest, all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that
such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under
this _Section 7.4(b)_. An Indemnitee's right to an Advancement of
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ is not subject to the
satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not conditioned upon any prior
determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.4(a)_ with respect to the related Action or the absence of any prior
determination to the contrary.

  



  

(c) _Contract Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be
contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, manager, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, estate, executors, administrators
and legal representatives.

  



  

(d) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under
_Sections 7.4(a)_ or _(b)_ is not paid in full by the Company within sixty
(60) calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Company,
except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be twenty (20) calendar days, the Indemnitee may
at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit,
or in a suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any
suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification under
this LLC Agreement (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a
right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any
suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to recover such
expenses, without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Act.
Neither the failure of the Company (including its Managing Member or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to
the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is
proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the
Company (including the Managing Member or independent legal counsel) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a
defense to such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses under this LLC Agreement,
or brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses under this LLC
Agreement pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that
the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of
Expenses, shall be on the Company.

  



  

   

\- 46 -

 



    



  

(e) _Appearance as a Witness_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Section 7.4_, the Company shall pay or reimburse out
of pocket expenses incurred by any Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant
to this _Section 7.4_ in connection with such Person's appearance as a
witness or other participation in an Action at a time when such Person is not
a named defendant or respondent in the Action.

  



  

(f) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and
the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this _Section 7.4_ shall not be
exclusive of any other right which a Person may have or hereafter acquire
under any Law, this LLC Agreement, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_
shall limit or otherwise affect any such other right or the Company's power
to confer any such other right.

  



  

(g) _No Duplication of Payments_. The Company shall not be liable
under this _Section 7.4_ to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of
any Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise
actually received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection
therewith and any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under
any insurance policy or from any other source in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses.

  



  

(h) _Maintenance of Insurance_. The Company or PubCo shall
maintain directors' and officers' insurance from a financially sound
and reputable insurer (at a minimum, in such amounts as are standard in the
industry) to protect directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries against Indemnifiable Losses of such Indemnitee, whether or not
the Company has the authority to indemnify such Indemnitee against such
Indemnifiable Losses under _this Section 7.4_, in each case to the extent
available under the directors' and officers' insurance policy of PubCo.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Resignation or Termination of Managing Member_. PubCo shall not,
by any means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as Managing Member except
in compliance with this _Section 7.5_. No termination or replacement of PubCo
as Managing Member shall be effective unless proper provision is made, in
compliance with this LLC Agreement, so that the obligations of PubCo, its
successor by merger (if applicable) and any new Managing Member and the
rights of all Members under this LLC Agreement and applicable Law remain
in full force and effect. No appointment of a Person other than PubCo (or its
successor by merger, as applicable) as Managing Member shall be effective
unless (a) the new Managing Member executes a joinder to this LLC Agreement
and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions in this LLC Agreement, and
(b) PubCo (or its successor by merger, as applicable) and the new
Managing Member (as applicable) provide all other Members with contractual
rights, directly enforceable by such other Members against PubCo (or its
successor by merger, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as
applicable), to cause (i) PubCo to comply with all PubCo's obligations under
this LLC Agreement (including its obligations _under Section 4.6_) other than
those that must necessarily be taken solely in its capacity as Managing
Member and (ii) the new Managing Member to comply with all the Managing
Member's obligations under this LLC Agreement.

  



  

   

\- 47 -

 



    

  



  

Section 7.6 _Reclassification Events of PubCo_. If a Reclassification Event
occurs, the Managing Member or its successor as a result of such
Reclassification Event, as the case may be, shall, as and to the extent
necessary, amend this LLC Agreement in compliance with _Section 12.1_, and
enter into any necessary supplementary or additional agreements, to ensure
that, following the effective date of the Reclassification Event: (a) the
exchange rights of holders of Units set forth in _Section 4.6_ provide that
each Common Unit (together with the surrender and delivery of one (1) share
of Class V Common Stock) is exchangeable for the same amount and same type of
property, securities or cash (or combination thereof) that one (1) share of
Class A Common Stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result
of the Reclassification Event and (b) PubCo or the successor to PubCo as a
result of such Reclassification Event, as applicable, is obligated to deliver
such property, securities or cash upon such exchange. PubCo shall not
consummate or agree to consummate any Reclassification Event unless the
successor Person as a result of such Reclassification Event, if any, becomes
obligated to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever capacity) under
this LLC Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Transactions between Company and Managing Member_. The Managing
Member may cause the Company to contract and deal with the Managing
Member, or any Affiliate of the Managing Member; _provided_ such contracts
and dealings (other than contracts and dealings between the Company and its
Subsidiaries) are on terms comparable to and competitive with those available
to the Company from others dealing at arm's length or are approved by the
Members or are otherwise approved by the Disinterested Majority.

  



  

Section 7.8 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. The Managing Member shall not be
compensated for its services as Managing Member of the Company. The Company
shall (a) pay, or cause to be paid, all costs, fees, operating expenses and
other expenses of the Company (including the costs, fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants or other professionals and the compensation of all
personnel providing services to the Company) incurred in pursuing and
conducting, or otherwise related to, the activities of the Company and (b)
upon the good faith determination of the Managing Member, reimburse the
Managing Member for any costs, fees or expenses incurred by it in connection
with serving as the Managing Member. To the extent that the Managing Member
determines in good faith that such expenses are related to the business and
affairs of the Managing Member that are conducted through the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries (including expenses that relate to the business and affairs
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and that also relate to other
activities of the Managing Member), the Managing Member may cause the Company
to pay or bear such expenses of the Managing Member, including costs of
securities offerings not borne directly by Members, board of directors
compensation and meeting costs, costs of periodic reports to its
stockholders, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation, accounting
and legal costs; _provided_  that the Company shall not pay or bear any
income tax obligations owed by PubCo or the cost of any Tax Benefit Payment
(as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or any amounts owed by PubCo
under the Tax Receivable Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
event any cost or expense incurred by the Managing Member is paid by the
Managing Member from the gross proceeds received by PubCo in connection with
an offering, issuance, exercise or conversion of Equity Securities or Debt
Securities and only the net amount of such proceeds is contributed to the
Company, such costs or expenses shall not be reimbursed under this _Section
7.8_.

ARTICLE VIII 
 ROLE OF MEMBERS

  



  

Section 8.1 _Rights or Powers_. Other than the Managing Member, the Members,
acting in their capacity as Members, shall not have any right or power to
take part in the operation, management or control of the Company or its
business and affairs, transact any business in the Company's name or to act
for or bind the Company in any way and shall not have any voting rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Members have all the rights and
powers set forth in this LLC Agreement and, to the extent not
inconsistent with this LLC Agreement, in the Act. Any Member, its Affiliates
and its and their employees, managers, owners, agents, directors and officers
may also be an employee or be retained as an agent of the Company. Nothing in
this _Article VIII_ shall in any way limit any Member's rights pursuant to,
and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Tax Receivable Agreement.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Various Capacities_. The Members acknowledge and agree that the
Members or their Affiliates will from time to time act in various capacities,
including as a Member or, in the case of PubCo, the Managing Member or the
Company Representative, or, in the case of Insight or an Affiliate thereof,
the Continuing Member Representative.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Investment Opportunities_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, shall not
apply to (a) any Member (other than PubCo in its capacity as the Managing
Member, the Managing Member (if not PubCo) and Members who are officers or
employees of the Company, PubCo or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in
which case solely acting in their capacity as such), (b) any of their
respective Affiliates (other than the Company, the Managing Member or any of
their respective Subsidiaries), (c) the Sponsor (or any of its members or
Affiliates), each Continuing Member or any of its respective
Affiliates (including its respective investors and equityholders and any
associated Persons or investment funds or any of their respective portfolio
companies or investments) or (d) any of the respective officers, managers,
directors, agents, shareholders, members, and partners of any of the
foregoing, including any such Person acting as a director of PubCo at the
request of such Member (each, a " _Business Opportunities Exempt Party_ ").
The Company and each of the Members, on its own behalf and on behalf of their
respective Affiliates and equityholders, hereby renounces any interest or
expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to
any Business Opportunities Exempt Party and irrevocably waives any right to
require any Business Opportunity Exempt Party to act in a manner
inconsistent with the provisions of this _Section 8.3_. No Business
Opportunities Exempt Party who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction,
agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for PubCo,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
equityholders shall have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to
the Company and none of PubCo, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates or equityholders will acquire or be entitled to any
interest or participation in any such transaction, agreement, arrangement or
other matter or opportunity as a result of participation therein by a
Business Opportunity Exempt Party. This _Section 8.3_ shall not apply to, and
no interest or expectancy of the Company is renounced with respect to, any
opportunity offered to any director of PubCo if such opportunity is expressly
offered or presented to, or acquired or developed by, such Person solely in
his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company.

  



  

   

\- 49 -

 



    

  



  

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, neither Insight, CC Capital, NBOKS nor any
of their respective Affiliates (other than PubCo) (or any partner, officer,
employee, investor, or other representative of any of the foregoing Persons)
(collectively, the " _Covered Persons_ ") shall be liable to the Company or
any other Person for any claim arising out of, or based upon, (i) the
investment by any Covered Person in any entity competitive with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) actions taken by any Covered
Person to assist any such competitive company, whether or not such action was
taken as a member of the board of directors of such competitive company or
otherwise, and whether or not such action has a detrimental effect on the
Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that such Covered Person complies with
any fiduciary relationship or duties owed to PubCo, the Company or its
Subsidiaries in such Covered Person's capacity as an officer or director of
PubCo, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt,
none of the Continuing Member Representative or any Affiliate thereof (or any
partner, officer, employee, investor, or other representative of any of the
foregoing Persons) will be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship or
duties to the other Continuing Members by virtue of its ownership of Units.

  



  

(c) No amendment or repeal of this _Section 8.3_ shall apply to
or have any effect on the Liability or alleged Liability of any Business
Opportunities Exempt Party or any Covered Person for or with respect to any
opportunities of which any such Person becomes aware prior to such amendment
or repeal. Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any
Units shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of
this _Section 8.3_. Neither the amendment or repeal of this  _Section 8.3_,
nor the adoption of any provision of this LLC Agreement inconsistent with this
_Section 8.3_, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this _Section 8.3_
in respect of any business opportunity first identified or any other matter
occurring, or any cause of Action that, but for this _Section 8.3_, would
accrue or arise, prior to such amendment, repeal or adoption. No action or
inaction taken by any Business Opportunities Exempt Party or any Covered
Person in a manner consistent with this _Section 8.3_ shall be deemed to be
a violation of any fiduciary or other duty owed to any Person.

  



  

ARTICLE IX 
 TRANSFERS OF UNITS

  



  

Section 9.1 _Restrictions on Transfer_.

  



  

(a) No Member shall Transfer all or any portion of its Units,
except Transfers made in accordance with the provisions of _Section
9.1(b)_. If, notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9.1(a)_, all or
any portion of a Member's Units are Transferred by such Member in violation
of this _Section 9.1(a)_, involuntarily, by operation of Law or otherwise,
then without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the other
Parties under this LLC Agreement, the Transferee of such Units (or
portion thereof) shall not be admitted to the Company as a Member nor be
entitled to any rights as a Member under this LLC Agreement, and the
Transferor will continue to be bound by all obligations under this LLC
Agreement. Any attempted or purported Transfer of all or a portion of a
Member's Units in violation of this _Section 9.1(a)_ shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, be null and void and of no force or effect
whatsoever. Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, (i) no shares of
Class V Common Stock may be Transferred by a Member unless an equal number of
Common Units are Transferred therewith in accordance with this LLC Agreement
(including in respect of those Transfers permitted by _Section 9.1(b)_), and
(ii) no Common Units may be Transferred by a Member holding Class V Common
Stock unless an equal number of shares of Class V Common Stock are
Transferred therewith in accordance with this LLC Agreement (including in
respect of those Transfers permitted by _Section 9.1(b)_).

  



  

   

\- 50 -

 



    

  



  

(b) The restrictions contained in _Section 9.1(a)_ shall not
apply to any Transfer (each, a " _Permitted Transfer_ "): (i) in connection
with an " _Exchange_ " made in accordance with the provisions of _Section
4.6_, (ii) by a Member to PubCo or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, or
(iii) by a Member to any of such Member's Permitted Transferees; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if a Transfer pursuant to clause (iii) would result in a Change
of Control, such Member must provide the Managing Member with written notice
of such Transfer at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the consummation
of such Transfer; _provided further_ , that the restrictions contained in this
LLC Agreement will continue to apply to Units after any Permitted Transfer of
such Units, and the Transferees of the Units so Transferred shall agree in
writing to be bound by the provisions of this LLC Agreement. In the case of a
Permitted Transfer of any Common Units by a Continuing Member, such
Transferring Member shall be required to Transfer an equal number of shares of
Class V Common Stock corresponding to the number of such Member's Common
Units that were Transferred in the transaction to such Transferee. All
Permitted Transfers are subject to the additional limitations set forth in
_Section 9.1(c)_.

  



  

(c) In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer contained in
this _Article IX_, in no event may any Transfer or assignment of Units by
any Member be made (i) to any Person who lacks the legal right, power or
capacity to own Units; (ii) if such Transfer would (A) be considered to be
effected on or through an "established securities market" or a
"secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof" as such terms are
used in Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1, (B) result in the Company
having more than 100 partners, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the rules of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)), (C) cause the Company to be treated as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
or to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation pursuant to the
Code, or (D) cause the Company to have a withholding obligation under Section
1446(f) of the Code; (iii) if such Transfer would cause the Company to
become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of
ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a
"disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code); (iv) if
such Transfer would, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, cause any
portion of the assets of the Company to constitute assets of any employee
benefit plan pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations or otherwise cause the
Company to be subject to regulation under ERISA; (v) if such Transfer requires
the registration of any equity securities issued upon any exchange of such
Units, pursuant to any applicable U.S. federal or state securities Laws, and
no registration statement covering such securities is then in effect; or (vi)
if such Transfer subjects the Company to regulation under the Investment
Company Act or the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. Any attempted or purported
Transfer of all or a portion of a Member's Units in violation of this
_Section 9.1(c)_ shall be null and void and of no force or effect
whatsoever.

each remaining Member or to the Company under this LLC Agreement or any other
contract between the Managing Member, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and such Transferor, on the other hand. Written notice of

Section 10.2 _Tax Elections_. The Company Representative shall cause the
Company and any eligible Subsidiary to make an election (or continue a
previously made election) pursuant to Section 754 of the Code (and any
analogous provision of any applicable state, local or non-U.S. Law) for the
Taxable Year that includes the date hereof and for each Taxable Year in which
an Exchange occurs, and shall not thereafter revoke any such election. In

Section 10.3 _Tax Returns; Information_.

  



  

(a) The Company Representative shall arrange for the preparation
and timely filing of all income and other tax and informational returns of
the Company. The Company shall prepare and deliver (or cause to be prepared
and delivered) to each Person who was a Member at any time during the
relevant quarter of the relevant Taxable Year an estimated K-1, including
reasonable quarterly estimates of such Member's state tax apportionment
information and the allocations to such Member of taxable income, gains,
losses, deductions or credits for such Taxable Year for U.S. federal, and
applicable state and local, income tax reporting purposes at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the individual or corporate quarterly estimate
payment deadline for U.S. federal income taxes for calendar year filers
(whichever is earlier). As promptly as reasonably practicable following the
end of each Taxable Year, the Company shall prepare and deliver (or cause to
be prepared and delivered) to each Person who was a Member at any time during
such Taxable Year (i) an estimated IRS Schedule K-1 (and any similar form
prescribed for applicable state and local income tax purposes) or similar
documents with such information of the Company and all relevant information
regarding the Company reasonably necessary for the Members to estimate their
taxable income for such Taxable Year, and (ii) in no event later than forty-
five (45) days prior to the individual or corporate filing deadline (with
extensions) for U.S. federal income taxes for calendar year filers
(whichever is earlier), a final IRS Schedule K-1 (and any similar form
prescribed for applicable state and local income tax purposes) and all
relevant information regarding the Company reasonably necessary for the
Members to file their tax returns on a timely basis (including extensions)
for such Taxable Year. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to furnish to each Member and former Member, as soon as reasonably
practicable after an applicable request, all information relating to the
Company and in the Company's possession reasonably requested by such Member
and that is reasonably necessary for such Member to prepare and file its own
tax returns and pay its own taxes or make distributions to its members in
order for them to pay their taxes (including copies of the Company's federal,
state and local income tax returns). Each Member and former Member shall
furnish to the Company all pertinent information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to enable the Company's tax returns to be prepared and
filed. Each Member further agrees (including with respect to the Taxable Year
that such Member becomes a former Member) that such Member shall notify the
Company and consult with the Company regarding a position on its tax return in
the event such Member intends to file its tax returns in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Schedule K-1 or other statements furnished by the
Company to such Member for purposes of preparing tax returns.

(b) In addition to each Member's rights to information pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 18-305 of the Act, each Member shall be
entitled to examine, either directly or through its representatives, the books
and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the principal office
of the Company or such other location as the Managing Member shall reasonably
approve during normal business hours for any purpose reasonably related to
such Member's interest as a Member of the Company with the information to
which such Member shall be entitled about the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries being the same information to which a stockholder of a Delaware
corporation would have with respect to such corporation; _provided_ that, in
any event, the Managing Member has a right to keep confidential from the
Members certain information in accordance with Section 18-305 of the Act.

  



  

Section 10.4 _Company Representative_.

  



  

(a) PubCo is hereby designated as the Company Representative. In
addition, PubCo is hereby authorized to designate or remove any other
Person selected by PubCo as the Company Representative; _provided_ that all
actions taken by the Company Representative pursuant to this _Section 10.4_
shall be subject to the overall oversight and authority of the Board. For each
Taxable Year in which the Company Representative is an entity, the Company
shall appoint the " _designated individual_ " identified by the Company
Representative and approved by the Board to act on its behalf in accordance
with the applicable Treasury Regulations or analogous provisions of state or
local Law. Each Member hereby expressly consents to such designations and
agrees to take, and that the Managing Member is authorized to take (or cause
the Company to take), such other actions as may be necessary or advisable
pursuant to Treasury Regulations or other Internal Revenue Service or Treasury
guidance or state or local Law to cause such designations or evidence such
Member's consent to such designations, including removing any Person
designated as the Company Representative (including any " _designated
individual_ ") prior to the date of this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(b) Subject to this _Section 10.4_, the Company Representative
shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the Company in
connection with, make all relevant decisions regarding application of, and to
exercise the rights and powers provided for in the BBA Rules, including
making any elections under the BBA Rules or any decisions to settle,
compromise, challenge, litigate or otherwise alter the defense of any Action,
audit or examination before the Internal Revenue Service or any other tax
authority (each an " _Audit_ "), and to reasonably expend Company funds for
professional services and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection
therewith. Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4(d)_, the Company
Representative will have sole discretion to determine whether the Company
(either on its own behalf or on behalf of the Members) will contest or
continue to contest any tax deficiencies assessed or proposed to be assessed
by any tax authority.

  



  

   

\- 54 -

 



    

  



  

(c) The Company Representative is authorized, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, to cause the Company to pay any imputed
underpayment of taxes and any related interest, penalties and additions to
tax determined in accordance with Code Section 6225 that may from time to
time be required to be made under Code Section 6232 and to pay any similar
amounts arising under state, local, or foreign tax Laws (together, " _Imputed
Tax Underpayments_ "). Imputed Tax Underpayments also shall include any
imputed underpayment within the meaning of Code Section 6225 (any similar
amounts arising under state, local, or foreign tax Laws) paid (or payable) by
any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
which the Company holds (or has held) a direct or indirect interest other
than through entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to the extent that the Company bears the economic burden of such
amounts, whether by Law or contract. To the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the Company Representative may cause the Company to allocate
the amount of any Imputed Tax Underpayment among the Members (including any
former Members) in an equitable manner, taking into account, among other
factors, the magnitude of the Imputed Tax Underpayment, the nature of the tax
items that are the subject of the adjustment giving rise to the Imputed Tax
Underpayment, the classification of the Members for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, and the Persons who received (and the proportions in which they
received) the benefits of the activities that gave rise to that Imputed Tax
Underpayment. To the extent that the Company Representative elects to cause
the Company to pay an Imputed Tax Underpayment, the Company Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue available procedures
under applicable Law to reduce such Imputed Tax Underpayment on account of its
Members' (or any of the Members' direct or indirect beneficial owners') tax
status, with any corresponding reduction being credited to the applicable
Member for purposes of allocating such Imputed Tax Underpayment among the
relevant Members or former Members to the extent relevant.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company Representative
shall give prompt written notice to the Continuing Member Representative
of the commencement of any income tax Audit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Continuing Members (or their owners), other than any Audit that
is the subject of Section 10.1(i) of the Business Combination Agreement to
the extent that such Audit is governed by such provisions of the Business
Combination Agreement (any such Audit that is not the subject of Section
10.1(i) of the Business Combination Agreement, a " _Specified Audit_ "). The
Company Representative shall (i) keep the Continuing Member Representative
reasonably informed of the material developments and status of any such
Specified Audit and (ii) promptly notify the Continuing Member
Representative of receipt of a notice of a final partnership adjustment (or
equivalent under applicable Laws) or a final decision of a court or IRS
Appeals panel (or equivalent body under applicable Laws) with respect to such
Specified Audit. The obligations of the Company and the Company
Representative under this _Section 10.4(d)_ with respect to any Specified
Audit affecting Continuing Members as a result of their prior ownership of
Units shall continue after the Continuing Members Transfer any or all of such
Units.

  



  

   

\- 55 -

 



    



  

(e) If the Company Representative causes the Company to make a
Push-Out Election, each Member who was a Member of the Company for
U.S. federal income tax purposes for the "reviewed year" (within the meaning
of Code Section 6225(d)(1) or similar concept under applicable state, local,
or non-U.S. Law), shall take any adjustment to income, gain, loss, deduction,
credit or otherwise (as determined in the notice of final partnership
adjustment or similar concept under applicable state, local, or non-U.S. Law)
into account as provided for in Code Section 6226(b) (or similar concept under
applicable state, local, or non-U.S. Law).

  



  

(f) Promptly following the written request of the Company
Representative, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
reimburse and indemnify the Company Representative (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any "designated individual") for all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable legal and accounting fees, claims, liabilities, losses
and damages incurred by the Company Representative in connection with the
exercise of its rights and fulfillment of its duties under this _Section
10.4_. Nothing in this LLC Agreement will be construed to restrict the
Company or the Company Representative from engaging an accounting firm or
legal counsel to assist the Company Representative in discharging its duties
under this LLC Agreement.

  



  

(g) Each Member agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Company
Representative and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably requested by the Company Representative with respect to this
_Section 10.4_, including timely providing any information reasonably
necessary or advisable for the Company Representative to comply with its
obligations under _Section 10.4(c)_, that is or are reasonably necessary or
advisable to reduce the amount of any tax, interest, penalties or similar
amounts the cost of which is (or would otherwise be) borne by the Company
(directly or indirectly) or to make any election permitted by this
LLC Agreement and the Code or other relevant tax Law unless such Member is
restricted from providing such information under any applicable Law or
contract. Each Member acknowledges that any action taken by the Company
Representative in its capacity as such may be binding upon such Members and
that such Member shall not independently act with respect to Audits affecting
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this LLC Agreement, no provision of this LLC Agreement shall
require, or give any Person the right to require, PubCo or the Continuing
Members to file any amended tax return.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this LLC
Agreement, in the event of any conflict between Section 10.1 of the
Business Combination Agreement and this LLC Agreement, Section 10.1 of the
Business Combination Agreement shall control. The Company, the Company
Representative, the Managing Member, and the Members hereby acknowledge and
agree to the foregoing sentence and expressly agree to be bound by the terms
of Section 10.1 of the Business Combination Agreement, including that with
respect to any Audit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending before or including the date of the Effective Time
and for which a Push-Out Election is available, all such available elections
shall be made in accordance with applicable Laws.

  



  

(i) This  _Section 10.4_ shall be interpreted to apply to Members
and former Members and shall survive the Transfer of a Member's Units and the
termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company and, for
this purpose to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company
shall be treated as continuing in existence.

Section 10.5 _Withholding Tax Payments and Obligations_.

  

  



  

(a) If the Company or any other Person in which the Company holds
an interest is required by Law to withhold or to make tax payments on behalf
of or with respect to any Member, or the Company is subjected to tax itself
(including any amounts withheld from amounts directly or indirectly payable
to the Company or to any other Person in which the Company holds an interest)
by reason of the status of any Member as such or that is specifically
attributable to a Member (including federal, state, local or foreign
withholding, personal property, unincorporated business or other taxes, the
amount of any Imputed Tax Underpayments allocated to a Member in accordance
with _Section 10.4_, and any interest, penalties, additions to tax, and
expenses related to any such amounts) (" _Tax Advances_ "), the Managing
Member may cause the Company to withhold such amounts and cause the
Company to make such tax payments as so required, and each Member hereby
authorizes the Company to do so; provided, the Company and Managing Member
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith with the
Continuing Member Representative to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such withholding which relates to any
Continuing Member. All Tax Advances made on behalf of a Member shall be
repaid by reducing the amount of the current or next succeeding Tax
Distribution or Tax Distributions and, if applicable, the proceeds of
liquidation that would otherwise have been made to such Member under this LLC
Agreement; _provided_ , that if a Tax Advance is made on behalf of a former
Member, then such former Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company
for the entire amount of such Tax Advance. For all purposes of this LLC
Agreement, such Member shall be treated as having received the amount of the
distribution, if applicable, that is equal to the Tax Advance at the time of
such Tax Advance and (if applicable) as having paid such Tax Advance to the
relevant taxing jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that the aggregate amount of Tax Advances for any period made on behalf of a
Member exceeds the actual Tax Distributions that would have otherwise been
made to such Member during the fifteen (15) months following such Tax
Advances, then such Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company for
the entire amount of such excess (which has not offset Tax Distributions
pursuant to this _Section 10.5_); _provided_ , that such indemnification
obligation shall be the several obligation of such Member and shall not be
treated as Capital Contributions. For the avoidance of doubt, any income
taxes, penalties, additions to tax and interest payable by the Company or any
fiscally transparent entity in which the Company owns an interest shall be
treated as specifically attributable to the Members and shall be allocated
among the Members such that the burden of (or any diminution in distributable
proceeds resulting from) any such amounts is borne by those Members to whom
such amounts are specifically attributable (whether as a result of their
status, actions, inactions or otherwise, including pursuant to an allocation
made under _Section 10.4(c)_), in each case as reasonably determined by the
Company Representative.

  



  

(b) This  _Section 10.5_ shall be interpreted to apply to Members
and former Members and shall survive the Transfer of a Member's Units and the
termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company and, for
this purpose, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the Company
shall be treated as continuing in existence.

consideration tax and other legal constraints that may adversely affect one
or more Members and subject to compliance with applicable Laws, unless, with

Company and, subject to _Section 11.4(a)_, the Managing Member shall have

value of the Company's assets during the period of dissolution and
liquidation.

shall be made from the date of the last previous accounting to the date of
dissolution, and a final allocation of all items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit in accordance with _Article V_ shall be made in such a
manner that, immediately before distribution of assets pursuant to _Section
11.3(b)(iii)_, the positive balance of the Capital Account of each
Member shall, to the greatest extent possible, be equal to the net amount
that would so be distributed to such Member (and any non-cash assets to be
distributed will first be written up or down to their Fair Market Value, thus
creating hypothetical gain or loss (if any), which resulting hypothetical
gain or loss shall be allocated to the Members' Capital Accounts in accordance
with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b) and other
applicable provisions of the Code and this LLC Agreement).

Capital Contributions, and (ii) no Member shall have priority over any other
Member as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions or
allocations, except with respect to the Distribution Catch-Up Payment as

of the Company permitted pursuant to _Section 4.1_ and  _Section 4.3_ and
any amendments or modifications to this LLC Agreement to the extent necessary
to reflect such creation or issuance shall not be deemed to
disproportionately and adversely affect a Member or remove a right or
privilege specifically granted to a Member in any event); or (x) modify the
limited liability of any Member, or increase the Liabilities of any
Member, in each case, without the prior written consent of each such affected
Member; or (y) alter or change any rights, preferences or privileges of any
Units in a manner that is different or prejudicial relative to any other Units
in the same class of Units, without the prior written consent of each such
affected Member; or (z) modify the requirement that any action, election,
decision or determination that is required to be approved or made by the
Disinterested Majority (including in respect of _Section 4.6_) be so
approved or made by the Disinterested Majority, without the prior written
approval of the Disinterested Majority serving on the Board at such time as
such modification is proposed to be made.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), the Managing Member,
acting alone, may amend this LLC Agreement, including _Exhibit A_, (i)
to reflect the admission of new Members, Transfers of Units, the issuance of
additional Units, in each case in accordance with the terms of this LLC
Agreement, and, subject to _Section 12.1(a)_, subdivisions or combinations of
Units made in accordance with _Section 4.1(h)_ and (ii) as necessary, and
solely to the extent necessary, based on the reasonable written advice of
legal counsel or a qualified tax advisor (including any nationally recognized
accounting firm) to the Company, to avoid the Company being classified as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the
Code.

  



  

(c) No waiver of any provision or default under, nor consent to
any exception to, the terms of this LLC Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing and signed by the Party to be bound and then only to the
specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.

  



  

Section 12.2 _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees that it will from time
to time, upon the reasonable request of another Party, execute such documents
and instruments and take such further action as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions of this LLC Agreement. The consummation of
Transfers, Exchanges and issuances of Equity Securities pursuant to this LLC
Agreement shall be subject to, and conditioned on, the completion of any
required regulatory filings with any applicable Governmental Entity (or the
termination or expiration of any waiting period in connection therewith),
including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, if
any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, to the
extent required in connection with such Transfer, Exchange or issuance. The
Members shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any such filing.

  



  

Section 12.3 _Successors and Assigns_. All of the terms and provisions of
this LLC Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns, but shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the successors and assigns of any Member only to the extent
that they are permitted successors and assigns pursuant to the terms of this
LLC Agreement. No Party may assign its rights under this LLC Agreement except
as permitted pursuant to this LLC Agreement, including assignment of such
rights to a Permitted Transferee and a Transferee of Units pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 9.3_.

  



  

Section 12.4 _Entire Agreement_. This LLC Agreement, together with all
Exhibits and Schedules to this LLC Agreement, the Business
Combination Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement, the Tax Receivable
Agreement and all other Ancillary Agreements (as such term is defined in the
Business Combination Agreement), constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings and discussions,
whether oral or written, relating to such subject matter in any way and there
are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the Parties in
connection with such subject matter except as set forth in this LLC Agreement
and therein.

Section 12.5 _Rights of Members Independent_. The rights available to the
Members under this LLC Agreement and at Law shall be deemed to be several and
not dependent on each other and each such right accordingly shall be construed
as complete in itself and not by reference to any other such right. Any one
or more and/or any combination of such rights may be exercised by a Member
and/or the Company from time to time and no such exercise shall exhaust the
rights or preclude another Member from exercising any one or more of such
rights or combination thereof from time to time thereafter or simultaneously.

  



  

Section 12.6 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The Law of
the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or matters related
to or arising from this LLC Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual
claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation,
validity and enforceability of this LLC Agreement, and the performance of the
obligations imposed by this LLC Agreement, in each case without giving effect
to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY
TO THIS LLC AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
(WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED
WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS LLC AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS LLC AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG
THE PARTIES UNDER THIS LLC AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND
REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT
EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS
FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for
the District of Delaware, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
LLC Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be heard
and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any Action arising
out of or relating to this LLC Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this
_Section 12.6_, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any Action so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at
equity.

  



  

Section 12.7 _Headings_. The descriptive headings of the Articles, Sections
and clauses of this LLC Agreement are for convenience only and do not
constitute a part of this LLC Agreement.

amendment hereto or any other agreements delivered pursuant to this
LLC Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts and

an original and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement.
No Party shall raise the use of a fax machine or email to deliver a signature
or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each Party forever waives any
such defense.

acknowledge that each Party to this LLC Agreement has been represented by
counsel in connection with this LLC Agreement and the transactions

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law

writing by the Managing Member, (a) disclose any Confidential Information to

a proposed Transferee if such disclosure is reasonably required in connection

Agreement to prospective and existing investors in connection with fund
raising, marketing, informational, transactional or reporting activities. Each

either directly or indirectly with PubCo and its Subsidiaries, or operate in
the same or similar business as PubCo and its Subsidiaries, and that nothing
herein shall be in any way construed to prohibit or such Continuing Members
or their respective Affiliates' ability to maintain, make or consider such
other investments;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Confidential Information

so that the amount of any Non-TRA Portion is deemed utilized, to the extent
available, prior to the amount of any TRA Portion, to the extent available
(with the TRA Portion being applied on a proportionate basis consistent with
the provisions of _Section 3.3_). The parties agree that (A) the payments
made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of (i) the Purchase and (ii)
Blocker NOLs (in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable law
and other than amounts accounted for as Imputed Interest) are intended to be
treated and shall be reported for all purposes, including Tax purposes, as
additional contingent consideration to the applicable TRA Parties for the
conversion of Company Units or Blocker Stock (as defined in the Business
Combination Agreement) contemplated by _Sections 3.1(a)_ and _(c)_ of
the Business Combination Agreement at the Closing that has the effect of, in
the case of the Common Units, creating additional Purchase Basis Adjustments
and the payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of an Exchange
are intended to be treated and shall be reported for all purposes, including
Tax purposes, as additional contingent consideration to the applicable
Exchanging Member for such Exchange that has the effect of creating
additional Exchange Basis Adjustments, in each case, to the Reference Assets
for the Corporate Taxpayer in the Taxable Year of payment, (B) as a result,
such additional Purchase Basis Adjustments and Exchange Basis Adjustments
shall be incorporated into the calculation for the Taxable Year of the
applicable payment and into the calculations for subsequent Taxable Years, as
appropriate, (C) the Actual Tax Liability shall take into account the
deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted
for as Imputed Interest under applicable law, and (D) the liability for U.S.
federal income Taxes of the Corporate Taxpayer and the amount of taxable
income of the Corporate Taxpayer for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as
determined for purposes of calculating the Actual Tax Liability and the
Hypothetical Tax Liability shall include, without duplication, such liability
for U.S. federal income Taxes and such U.S. federal taxable income that is
economically borne by or allocated to the Corporate Taxpayer as a result of
the provisions of Section 10.4 and Section 10.5 of the LLC Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such liability for Taxes and such taxable income
shall be included in the Hypothetical Tax Liability and the Actual Tax
Liability subject to the adjustments and assumptions set forth in the
definitions thereof and, to the extent any such amount is taken into account
on an Amended Schedule, such amount shall adjust a Tax Benefit Payment, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_.

Section 2.3 _Procedures, Amendments_.

  



  

(a) _Procedure_. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a
TRA Party an applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any
Amended Schedule delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_, and any Early
Termination Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall also (x) deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and
work papers, as determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably
requested by such TRA Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and
calculations that were relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule, and
(y) allow the TRA Party Representative and its advisors reasonable access to
the appropriate representatives of the Corporate Taxpayer, as determined by
the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by the TRA Party
Representative. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit Schedule or Early
Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along with any
supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed
presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability and the
Hypothetical Tax Liability and identifies any material assumptions or
operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes of
such calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become
final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the date on
which all relevant TRA Parties have been given the applicable Schedule or
amendment thereto under _Section 7.1,_ unless the TRA Party Representative
(i) within thirty (30) calendar days from such date gives the Corporate
Taxpayer written notice of a material objection to such Schedule or amendment
thereto made in good faith (" _Objection Notice_ "), or (ii) provides a
written waiver of its right to give an Objection Notice within the period
described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or amendment
thereto shall become binding on the date such waiver is received by the
Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues
raised in the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt
by the Corporate Taxpayer of such Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer
and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures
described in _Section 7.9_ (the " _Reconciliation Procedures_ "), in which
case such Schedule or Amended Schedule shall become binding in accordance
with _Section 7.9_. The TRA Party Representative will represent the interests
of each of the TRA Parties and shall raise and pursue, in accordance with
this _Section 2.3(a)_, any objection to a Schedule or amendment
thereto timely given in writing to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA
Party.

  



  

(b) _Amended Schedule_. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable
Year may be amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i)
in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct
material inaccuracies in the Schedule, including those identified as a result
of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year
after the date the Schedule was provided to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with
an Expert's determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv)
to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit, or the Realized Tax
Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward
of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in
the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year
attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi)
to adjust an applicable TRA Party's Basis Schedule to take into account
payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement (any such Schedule, an "
_Amended Schedule_ "). If applicable, the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide an
Amended Schedule to each TRA Party when the Corporate Taxpayer delivers the
Basis Schedule for the following Taxable Year. In the event a Schedule is
amended after such Schedule becomes final pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ or, if
applicable, _Section 7.9_, (A) the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into
account in calculating any Tax Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to
which the amendment relates but instead shall be taken into account in
calculating the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for the Taxable Year in
which the amendment actually occurs, and (B) as a result of the foregoing, any
increase of the Net Tax Benefit attributable to an Amended Schedule shall not
accrue the Interest Amount (or any other interest hereunder) until after the
due date (without extensions) for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to Taxes for the Taxable Year in
which the amendment actually occurs.

Section 2.4 _Section 754 Election_.

  



  

For the Taxable Year that includes the date hereof and for each Taxable Year
in which an Exchange occurs and with respect to which the Corporate
Taxpayer has obligations under this TRA Agreement, the Corporate Taxpayer, in
its capacity as the sole managing member of OpCo, shall (i) ensure that OpCo
will, and (ii) ensure that each of OpCo's direct and indirect Subsidiaries
that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes will,
in each case, have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code (and
under any similar provisions of applicable U.S. state or local law) for each
such Taxable Year.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 3.1 _Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Payments_. Within five (5) Business Days after a Tax Benefit
Schedule delivered to a TRA Party becomes final in accordance with _Section
2.3(a)_ or, if applicable, _Section 7.9_, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay
such TRA Party for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined
pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ that is Attributable to the relevant TRA Party.
Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account previously designated by such TRA Party to
the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and
such TRA Party. The payments provided for pursuant to the above sentence
shall be computed separately for each TRA Party. Without limiting the
Corporate Taxpayer's ability to make offsets against Tax Benefit Payments to
the extent permitted by _Section 3.5_, no TRA Party shall be required to
make a payment or return a payment to the Corporate Taxpayer in respect of
any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by the Corporate
Taxpayer to such TRA Party (including any portion of any Early Termination
Payment).

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(b) A  " _Tax Benefit Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party for a
Taxable Year means an amount, not less than zero, equal to the sum of (i) the
Net Tax Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Party and (ii) the Interest
Amount with respect thereto. Subject to _Section 3.3_, the " _Net Tax
Benefit_ " for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of eighty-five percent (85%) of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of
the end of such Taxable Year, over the total amount of payments previously
made under the first sentence of _Section 3.1(a)_ (excluding payments
attributable to Interest Amounts); _provided_ that if there is no such excess
(or if a deficit exists), no TRA Party shall be required to make a payment
(or return a payment) to the Corporate Taxpayer in respect of any portion of
any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by the Corporate Taxpayer to such TRA
Party. The " _Interest Amount_ " shall equal the interest on the Net Tax
Benefit calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions)
for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer
with respect to Taxes for the applicable Taxable Year until the payment
date under _Section 3.1(a)_; _provided_ that such interest shall not accrue
on the amount of any Net Tax Benefit after the date on which such amount is
actually paid to the applicable TRA Party, regardless of whether such payment
is made prior to the due date for such payment under _Section 3.1(a)_ and
regardless of whether the amount of any unpaid Net Tax Benefit has yet become
final in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_ or, if applicable, _Section 7.9_.

  



  

Section 3.2 _No Duplicative Payments_. It is intended that the
provisions of this TRA Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of
any amount (including interest) required under this TRA Agreement, including
that the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments (excluding payments attributable to
Interest Amounts) for any Taxable Year shall not exceed the Net Tax
Benefit for such Taxable Year. For purposes of this TRA Agreement, no Tax
Benefit Payment shall be based on estimated Tax payments, including United
States federal estimated income Tax payments. The provisions of this TRA
Agreement shall be construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such
intentions are realized.

  



  

Section 3.3 _Pro Rata Payments_. Notwithstanding anything in _Section
3.1_ to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax Benefit
of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to the Tax Attributes is limited in a
particular Taxable Year because the Corporate Taxpayer does not have
sufficient taxable income, the Net Tax Benefit for the Corporate Taxpayer
shall be allocated among all parties eligible for Tax Benefit Payments under
this TRA Agreement in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit,
respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if the
Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient taxable income so that there were no such
limitation.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Payment Ordering_. If for any reason the Corporate Taxpayer
does not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all Tax Benefit
Payments due under this TRA Agreement in respect of a particular Taxable Year,
then the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree that (i) Tax Benefit
Payments for such Taxable Year shall be allocated to all parties eligible for
Tax Benefit Payments under this TRA Agreement in proportion to the amounts of
Net Tax Benefit, respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA
Party if the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient cash available to make such Tax
Benefit Payments and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payments shall be made in respect of
any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments to all TRA Parties in respect
of all prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Overpayments_. To the extent the Corporate Taxpayer makes a
payment to a TRA Party in respect of a particular Taxable Year under _Section
3.1(a)_ in an amount in excess of the amount of such payment that should have
been made to such TRA Party in respect of such Taxable Year (taking into
account _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.4_) under the terms of this TRA
Agreement, then such TRA Party shall not receive further payments under
_Section 3.1(a)_ until such TRA Party has foregone an amount of payments
equal to such excess and, for the avoidance of doubt, such TRA Party shall not
be entitled to any additional payments (including any additional payments
attributable to Interest Amounts) under this TRA Agreement in respect of such
foregone amounts. For clarity, the operation of this _Section 3.5_ with
respect to any particular TRA Party shall not affect the rights or
obligations of any other TRA Party under this TRA Agreement.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

Section 3.6 _Offset_. To the extent OpCo or any of its Subsidiaries
incurs any liability (including reasonable costs and expenses, including
advisor fees, incurred with respect thereto) (to the extent not reflected in
Closing Company Indebtedness (as defined in the Business Combination
Agreement)) payable after the Closing Date relating to any of the matters
described in _Exhibit B_ hereto (an " _Offset Liability_ "), then the
Corporate Taxpayer shall promptly deliver, or cause OpCo to deliver, a
written notice to the TRA Party Representative setting forth in reasonable
detail the amount of such Offset Liability and reasonable supporting
documentation (which shall be final and binding on the parties hereto absent
manifest error), and no TRA Party shall be entitled to receive further
payments under _Section 3.1(a)_ until TRA Parties have collectively foregone
(proportionately among the TRA Parties then entitled to receive payments
hereunder in accordance with the payments to which each such TRA Party would
have otherwise been entitled) an aggregate amount of payments equal to the
amount of such Offset Liability. To the extent any payments are foregone
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such foregone payments shall
be treated for all purposes of this TRA Agreement as having been paid to the
TRA Parties to which such payments would have otherwise been made (absent
the application of the immediately preceding sentence), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, no TRA Party shall be entitled to any additional payments
(including any additional payments attributable to Interest Amounts) under
this TRA Agreement in respect of such foregone amounts; provided, however,
that such foregone payments shall not be treated as having been made to the
TRA Parties for income tax purposes.

  



  

Article IV

  



  

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 4.1 _Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement_.

  



  

(a) _Corporate Taxpayer 's Early Termination Right_. The
Corporate Taxpayer may, with the prior written consent of the TRA
Disinterested Majority, terminate this TRA Agreement (including with respect
to all amounts payable to the TRA Parties and with respect to all of the
Units held by the TRA Parties, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence)
at any time by paying to each TRA Party the entire Early Termination Payment
in respect of such TRA Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that this TRA Agreement
shall terminate only upon the receipt by each TRA Party of its respective
entire Early Termination Payment and payments described in the next
sentence, if any, and _provided further_ that the Corporate Taxpayer may
withdraw any notice to execute its termination rights under this _Section
4.1(a)_ prior to the time at which any Early Termination Payment has been paid
in its entirety. Upon payment of the entire Early Termination Payment by the
Corporate Taxpayer to all of the TRA Parties, none of the TRA Parties or the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have any further payment rights or obligations under
this TRA Agreement, other than with respect to any (i) any Tax Benefit
Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the Early Termination
Date (which Tax Benefit Payments shall not be included in the Early
Termination Payments) and as of the date of payment of the Early Termination
Payment and (ii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the Taxable Year ending
immediately prior to or including the Early Termination Date (except to the
extent that the amounts described in this clause (ii) are included in the
calculation of the Early Termination Payments (at the option of the Corporate
Taxpayer) or are included in clause (i)); _provided_ that upon payment in full
of all amounts to all TRA Parties, to the extent applicable and without
duplication, described in this _Section 4.1(a)_, this TRA Agreement shall
terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Exchange occurs after the
Corporate Taxpayer has made all of the required Early Termination Payments
described herein, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this
TRA Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

  



  

   

16

 



    



  

(b) _Acceleration Upon Change of Control_. In the event of a
Change of Control, the Corporate Taxpayer shall provide at least 20 days'
prior written notice of such Change of Control to the TRA Parties, and the
TRA Party Representative shall have the option, upon written notice to the
Corporate Taxpayer, to cause the acceleration of the unpaid payment
obligations as calculated in accordance with this _Section 4.1(b)_, and such
payment obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had
been delivered on the date of such Change of Control and shall include,
without duplication: (i) the Early Termination Payments calculated with
respect to such TRA Parties as if the Early Termination Date is the date of
such Change of Control; (ii) any Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and
that remain unpaid as of the date of such Change of Control (which Tax Benefit
Payments shall not be included in the Early Termination Payments described in
clause (i)); and (iii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the Taxable Year
ending immediately prior to or including the date of such Change of Control
(except to the extent that the amounts described in this clause (iii) are
included in the calculation of Early Termination Payments described in clause
(i) (at the option of the Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in clause
(ii)); _provided_ that the procedures of _Section 4.2_ (and  _Section 2.3_,
to the extent applicable) and _Section 4.3_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_
with respect to the determination of the amount payable by the Corporate
Taxpayer pursuant to this sentence and the payment thereof, except that such
amount shall not be due and payable until five (5) Business Days after such
amount has become final pursuant to  _Section 4.2_ or, if applicable,
_Section 7.9_. In the event of an acceleration following a Change of
Control, any Early Termination Payment described in the preceding sentence
shall be calculated utilizing the Valuation Assumptions, substituting in each
case the terms "date of a Change of Control" for an "Early Termination Date,"
and if an Exchange occurs after the Corporate Taxpayer makes all such
required Early Termination Payments in their entirety and other payments
described in this _Section 4.1(b)_, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no
obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

  



  

(c) _Acceleration Upon Material Breach of TRA Agreement_.

  



  

(i) In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer materially breaches
any of its material obligations under this TRA Agreement, whether as a result
of (1) a failure to make a payment required to be made pursuant to this TRA
Agreement by the Final Payment Date therefor (except for all or a portion of
such payment that is being validly disputed in good faith under this TRA
Agreement, and then only with respect to the amount in dispute) (a " _Payment
Default_ ") or (2) any material breach of any of its material obligations
under this TRA Agreement (other than a Payment Default) (a " _Non-Payment
Default_ "), which failure or breach, (A) in the case of a Payment Default,
continues without payment in full until the date that is thirty (30) calendar
days following receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of written notice of such
Payment Default from the TRA Party Representative following such Payment
Default, or (B) in the case of a Non-Payment Default, continues without cure
for a period of thirty (30) calendar days following receipt by the Corporate
Taxpayer of written notice of such Non-Payment Default from the TRA
Party Representative following such Non-Payment Default (such written notice
delivered under clause (A) or (B), a " _Breach Notice_ "), except in each
case to the extent otherwise set forth in _Section 4.1(c)(iii)_ or by
operation of law as a result of the rejection of this TRA Agreement in a case
commenced under bankruptcy laws (such rejection, a " _Bankruptcy Rejection_
"), then, the unpaid payment obligations as calculated in accordance with
_Section 4.1(c)(ii)_ shall (I) in the case of a Payment Default,
automatically accelerate and become immediately due and payable upon
expiration of the applicable period in clause (A) above (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such acceleration shall occur earlier than thirty (30)
calendar days following receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of a Breach Notice
with respect to such Payment Default, and receipt of a Breach Notice shall be
a condition precedent to any such acceleration), or (II) in the case of a Non-
Payment Default, accelerate and become immediately due and payable upon
written notice of acceleration from the TRA Party Representative to
the Corporate Taxpayer at any time after the expiration of the applicable
period in clause (B) above ( _provided_ that in the case of any Bankruptcy
Rejection, such acceleration shall be automatic without any such written
notice, unless such acceleration is waived in writing by the TRA Party
Representative, which waiver may be retroactive).

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(ii) The unpaid payment obligations specified in _Section
4.1(c)(i)_ shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered on the date of such Breach Notice (or, in the case of any Bankruptcy
Rejection, on the date of such Bankruptcy Rejection) and shall include,
without duplication: (i) the Early Termination Payments calculated with
respect to such TRA Parties as if the Early Termination Date is the date of
such Breach Notice or such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable; (ii) any Tax
Benefit Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the date of such
Breach Notice or such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable (which Tax Benefit
Payments shall not be included in the Early Termination Payments described in
clause (i)); and (iii) any Tax Benefit Payments due for the Taxable Year
ending immediately prior to or including the date of such Breach Notice or
such Bankruptcy Rejection, as applicable (except to the extent that the
amounts described in this clause (iii) are included in the calculation of
Early Termination Payments described in clause (i) (at the option of the
Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in clause (ii)); _provided_ that the
procedures of _Section 4.2_ (and _Section 2.3_, to the extent applicable)
and _Section 4.3_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ with respect to the
determination of the amount payable by the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to
this sentence and the payment thereof, except that such amount shall not be
due and payable until five (5) Business Days after such amount has become
final pursuant to _Section 4.2_ or, if applicable, _Section 7.9_. In the
event of an acceleration described in this _Section 4.1(c)_, any Early
Termination Payment described in the preceding sentence shall be calculated
utilizing the Valuation Assumptions, substituting in each case the terms "date
of a Breach Notice" or "date of a Bankruptcy Rejection," as applicable, for
an "Early Termination Date," and if an Exchange occurs after the Corporate
Taxpayer makes all such required Early Termination Payments in their entirety
and other payments described in this _Section 4.1(c)_, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to
such Exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporate
Taxpayer breaches this TRA Agreement and such breach is not a material breach
of a material obligation under this TRA Agreement, a TRA Party shall still be
entitled to enforce all of its rights otherwise available under this TRA
Agreement, but shall not be entitled to an acceleration of amounts payable
under this _Section 4.1(c)_.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this TRA Agreement to the
contrary, except in the case of an Early Termination Payment or any payment
made in connection with a Change of Control, it shall not be a Payment
Default or Non-Payment Default (and no Breach Notice may be delivered)
under this TRA Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer fails to make any payment
due pursuant to this TRA Agreement (other than an Early Termination Payment
or any payment made in connection with a Change of Control) to the extent that
the Corporate Taxpayer (w) has insufficient funds, or cannot make such
payment as a result of obligations imposed in connection with any Senior
Obligations, and cannot take commercially reasonable actions to obtain
sufficient funds, to make such payment or (x) would become insolvent as a
result of making such payment (in each case, as determined by the Board in
good faith) (clauses (w) and (x) together, the " _Liquidity Exceptions_ ");
_provided_ that the interest provisions of _Section 5.2_ shall apply to such
late payment (unless the Corporate Taxpayer does not have sufficient funds to
make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by, or payment
obligations under, any Senior Obligations, in which case _Section 5.2_ shall
apply, but the Default Rate shall be replaced by the Agreed Rate); _provided
further_ that any such payment obligation shall nonetheless accrue for the
benefit of the TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall make such payment
at the first opportunity that the Liquidity Exceptions do not apply;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if the Liquidity Exceptions apply
and the Corporate Taxpayer declares or pays any dividend of cash to its
shareholders while any such Tax Benefit Payment is due and payable and
remains unpaid more than thirty (30) days following the relevant Final Payment
Date, then the Liquidity Exceptions shall no longer apply and a Breach Notice
may be immediately delivered.

  



  

(d) Any Tax Attributes attributable to the Closing or to Exchanges
(or deemed Exchanges) with respect to which a payment has been made under
_Section 4.1(a)_ or _Section 4.1(c)_ shall be excluded in calculating any
future Tax Benefit Payments or Early Termination Payments, and in such case,
this TRA Agreement shall have no further application to such payments.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Early Termination Notice_. If the Corporate Taxpayer
chooses to exercise its right of early termination in accordance with
_Section 4.1_ above, the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to each TRA Party
written notice of such decision to exercise such right (" _Early Termination
Notice_ ") and a schedule (the " _Early Termination Schedule_ ") specifying
the Corporate Taxpayer's decision to exercise such right and showing in
reasonable detail the calculation of the Early Termination Payment(s) due to
each TRA Party. Each Early Termination Schedule shall become final and
binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which
all TRA Parties have been given such Schedule or amendment thereto under
_Section 7.1_, unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30)
calendar days after such date gives the Corporate Taxpayer written notice of
a material objection to such Schedule made in good faith ("
_Material Objection Notice_ ") or (ii) provides a written waiver of its right
to give a Material Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i)
above, in which case such Schedule shall become binding on the date such
waiver is received by the Corporate Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and
the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to
successfully resolve the issues raised in such Material Objection Notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of
the Material Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures in which case such
Schedule shall become binding in accordance with _Section 7.9_. The TRA Party
Representative will represent the interests of each of the TRA Parties and
shall raise and pursue, in accordance with this _Section 4.2_, any objection
to an Early Termination Schedule or amendment thereto timely given in writing
to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

Section 4.3 _Payment upon Early Termination_.

  



  

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after an Early Termination
Effective Date, the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Party an
amount equal to the entire Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA
Party. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account or accounts designated by such TRA Party or as
otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Party or, in the
absence of such designation or agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing
address provided by such TRA Party to the Corporate Taxpayer.

  



  

(b) " _Early Termination Payment_ " in respect of a TRA Party
shall equal the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of
and starting from the applicable Early Termination Date, of all Tax Benefit
Payments (excluding the Interest Amount, unless such amount was previously
due and owing hereunder and not previously paid) in respect of such TRA Party
that would be required to be paid by the Corporate Taxpayer beginning from
the Early Termination Date (but which have not been previously paid as of
such date), and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such
TRA Party are applied and that each such Tax Benefit Payment for each
relevant Taxable Year would be paid on the due date (including extensions)
under applicable law as of the Early Termination Date for filing of IRS Form
1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for each such Taxable
Year. For the avoidance of doubt, an entire Early Termination Payment shall
be made to each applicable TRA Party regardless of whether such TRA Party
has exchanged all of its Common Units as of the Early Termination Date.

  



  

Article V

  



  

 _SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS_

  



  

Section 5.1 _Subordination_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
TRA Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment, Early Termination
Payment or any other payment required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to
any TRA Party under this TRA Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in
right of payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable
in respect of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money
(whether secured or unsecured, senior or subordinated and/or however
evidenced, including by bonds, notes or other debt instruments) of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (the " _Senior Obligations_ ") and
shall rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all current or future
unsecured obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior
Obligations. To the extent that any payment under this TRA Agreement is not
permitted to be made at the time payment is due as a result of this _Section
5.1_ and the terms of agreements governing Senior Obligations, such
payment obligation nevertheless shall accrue for the benefit of TRA Parties
and the Corporate Taxpayer shall make such payments at the first opportunity
that such payments are permitted to be made in accordance with the terms of
the Senior Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this TRA
Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the Corporate Taxpayer or any of
its Affiliates enters into future Tax receivable or other similar agreements
(" _Future TRAs_ "), the Corporate Taxpayer shall use reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA shall provide that the Tax
Attributes subject to this TRA Agreement are senior in priority in all
respects to any Tax attributes subject to any such Future TRA for purposes of
calculating the amount and timing of payments under any such Future TRA.

Section 5.2 _Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer_. Subject to the
proviso in the last sentence of  _Section 4.1(b)_, the amount of all or any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made
to the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this TRA Agreement, whether as
a result of _Section 5.1_ or otherwise, shall be payable together with any
interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate (in place of the Agreed Rate,
if applicable) commencing from the date on which such Tax Benefit Payment or
Early Termination Payment was first due and payable until the date of
actual payment; _provided_ , that if the Corporate Taxpayer does not have
sufficient funds to make the payment as a result of limitations imposed by,
or payment obligations in respect of, any Senior Obligations, interest shall
instead be computed at the Agreed Rate.

 _NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION_

  



  

Section 6.1 _Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer 's and OpCo's Tax
Matters_. Except as otherwise provided in this TRA Agreement, the Business
Combination Agreement or the LLC Agreement, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have
full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax matters concerning
the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo, including the preparation, filing or
amending of any Tax Return and defending, contesting or settling any issue
pertaining to Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall notify the TRA Party Representative in writing of the commencement of,
and keep the TRA Party Representative reasonably informed with respect to,
the portion of any audit of the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo or any of OpCo's
Subsidiaries by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which would reasonably be
expected to materially affect the rights and obligations of a TRA Party under
this TRA Agreement, including the Tax Benefit Payments payable to TRA Parties,
and shall provide to the TRA Party Representative reasonable opportunity (at
the cost and expense of the TRA Party Representative, on behalf of the TRA
Parties) to participate in or provide information and other input to the
Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo and its Subsidiaries and their respective advisors
concerning the conduct of any such portion of such audit; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Corporate Taxpayer and OpCo (and its Subsidiaries) shall
not be required to take any action that is inconsistent with any provision of
the LLC Agreement or the Business Combination Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Consistency_. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties
agree to report and cause their respective Affiliates to report for all
purposes, including United States federal, state and local Tax purposes and
financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related items (including the
Basis Adjustments and each Tax Benefit Payment) in a manner consistent with
that set forth in this TRA Agreement or specified by the Corporate Taxpayer
in any Schedule, or Amended Schedule, provided by or on behalf of the
Corporate Taxpayer under this TRA Agreement that is final and binding on the
parties, unless otherwise required by applicable law. The Corporate Taxpayer
shall (and shall cause OpCo and its other Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to) (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the
interests and entitlements of all TRA Parties under this TRA Agreement) defend
the Tax treatment contemplated by this TRA Agreement and any Schedule (or
Amended Schedule, as applicable) in any audit, contest or similar proceeding
with any Taxing Authority.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Cooperation_. Each of the TRA Parties shall (a) furnish to
the Corporate Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and
other materials as the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes
of making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate under
this TRA Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any
audit, examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request in
connection with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter. OpCo shall reimburse
the TRA Parties for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to this _Section 6.3_.

Section 7.2 _Counterparts_. This TRA Agreement may be executed and
delivered in one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic

the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each party forever waives any such defense.

Section 7.3 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This TRA
Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
together with all Exhibits and Schedules to this TRA Agreement, contain the
entire agreement and understanding among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter
in any way. Nothing in this TRA Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this TRA Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Governing Law_. The law of the State of Delaware shall
govern (a) all claims or matters related to or arising from this TRA
Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions
concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of
this TRA Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
TRA Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or
conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 7.5 _Severability_. If any provision of this TRA Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any governmental entity,
all other provisions of this TRA Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this TRA Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 7.6 _Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers_.

  



  

(a) No TRA Party may assign all or any portion of its rights or
obligations under this TRA Agreement to any Person without the prior
written approval of the TRA Disinterested Majority (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that, (i) to the extent that a TRA
Party Transfers Units to any of such TRA Party's Permitted Transferees in
accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement, the Transferring TRA Party
shall have the option to assign, without the approval of the Board or TRA
Disinterested Majority, to the Transferee of such Units the Transferring TRA
Party's rights and obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to such
Transferred Units, and (ii) any and all payments payable or that may become
payable to a TRA Holder pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned to any
Person or Persons so long as any such Person, in connection with such
assignment, executes and delivers an acknowledgement that such Person shall
have no rights under this Agreement other than the right to enforce
such Person's right to receive payments under this Agreement. As a condition
to any such assignment, each Transferee approved by the TRA Disinterested
Majority or Permitted Transferee, as applicable, and the Corporate Taxpayer
shall execute and deliver a joinder to this TRA Agreement, in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all
purposes of this TRA Agreement, except as otherwise provided in such joinder.
If a TRA Party Transfers Units in accordance with the terms of the LLC
Agreement but does not assign to the Transferee of such Units its rights and
obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to such Transferred Units,
(i) such TRA Party shall remain a TRA Party under this TRA Agreement for all
purposes, including with respect to the receipt of Tax Benefit Payments to
the extent payable hereunder (including any Tax Benefit Payments in respect
of the Exchanges of such Transferred Units by such Transferee), and (ii) the
Transferee of such Units shall not be a TRA Party. The Corporate Taxpayer may
not assign any of its rights or obligations under this TRA Agreement to any
Person (other than in connection with a Mandatory Assignment) without the
prior written consent of the TRA Party Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any purported assignment in
violation of the terms of this _Section 7.6_ shall be null and void.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(b) No provision of this TRA Agreement may be amended, unless such
amendment is approved in writing by each of the Corporate Taxpayer (as
determined by the TRA Disinterested Majority) and by the TRA Parties who would
be entitled to receive at least 50% of the total amount of the Early
Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties under this TRA Agreement if
the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early termination on the
date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for
purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to
this TRA Agreement since the date of such most recent Exchange); _provided_
 that no such amendment shall be effective if such amendment will have a
disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA Parties will be
entitled to receive under this TRA Agreement unless such amendment is
consented to in writing by such TRA Parties disproportionately affected. No
provision of this TRA Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

  



  

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be
binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs,
executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer
shall require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase,
merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the
business or assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly
to assume and agree to perform this TRA Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if
no such succession had taken place (any such assignment, a " _Mandatory
Assignment_ ").

  



  

Section 7.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this TRA
Agreement and the table of contents to this TRA Agreement are for reference

of this TRA Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit
attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set

References to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic form. References
herein to any Person shall include such Person's heirs, executors, personal

Agreement. References herein to a Person in a particular capacity
or capacities shall exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference

counsel have reviewed and negotiated this TRA Agreement as the joint
agreement and understanding of such parties, and the language used in this TRA
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by such parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person.

Section 7.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) EACH PARTY TO THIS TRA AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY
DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO
THIS TRA AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS TRA AGREEMENT AND/OR
THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. THE PARTIES HERETO
FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS
LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL
RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 7.9_, each of the parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for
the District of Delaware, in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this TRA Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of such
action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court
and agrees not to bring any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this TRA Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this _Section
7.8_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party agrees that a final
judgment in any action, suit or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law or at equity.

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

Section 7.9 _Reconciliation_. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer
and the TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with
respect to the calculation of amounts owed pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ , _4.1_
and _4.2_ within the relevant period designated in this TRA Agreement ("
_Reconciliation Dispute_ "), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for
determination to a nationally recognized expert in the particular area of
disagreement, acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator (the " _Expert_
"), mutually acceptable to the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative. The Expert shall be a partner or principal of
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG, BDO USA, LLP, Grant
Thornton LLP, Alvarez and Marsal, or RSM US LLP, and unless the Corporate
Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative agree in writing otherwise, the
Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any
material relationship with any party to this TRA Agreement, any Affiliate of
any such parties, or any other actual or potential conflict of interest. If
the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative are unable to
agree on an Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the
respondent(s) of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall cause the Expert to
be selected by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise
(the " _ICC_ ") in accordance with the criteria set forth above in this 
_Section 7.9_. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to the Basis
Schedule or an amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an
amendment thereto within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any
matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within
fifteen (15) calendar days or, in each case, as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to
the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the
matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a
disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax
Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount
shall be paid on the date prescribed by this TRA Agreement and such Tax
Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate Taxpayer, subject to
adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The sum of (a) the costs and
expenses relating to (i) the engagement (and, if applicable, selection by the
ICC) of such Expert and (ii) if applicable, amending any Tax Return in
connection with the decision of such Expert and (b) the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative incurred in the conduct of such proceeding shall be allocated
between the Corporate Taxpayer, on the one hand, and the TRA Party
Representative (on behalf of the TRA Parties), on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the
Expert that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Expert) bears to the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted, and each such party shall promptly reimburse the other party for
the excess that such other party has paid in respect of such costs and
expenses over the amount it has been so allocated. The Corporate Taxpayer may
withhold payments under this TRA Agreement to collect amounts due under the
preceding sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation
Dispute within the meaning of this _Section 7.9_ shall be decided by the
Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the
determinations of the Expert pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall be binding
on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA Parties and may be entered and
enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

Section 7.10 _Withholding_. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this TRA Agreement
such amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local, foreign or other Tax law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Corporate Taxpayer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify and
shall reasonably cooperate with the TRA Party Representative prior to the
making of such deductions and withholding payments to determine whether any
such deductions or withholding payments (other than any deduction or
withholding required by reason of such TRA Party's failure to comply with the
last sentence of this _Section 7.10_) are required under applicable law and
in obtaining any available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing
to the extent permitted by applicable law, such deduction and withholding. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this TRA Agreement as having been paid
to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. To the extent that
any payment pursuant to this TRA Agreement is not reduced by such deductions
or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify the applicable withholding
agent for any amounts imposed by any Taxing Authority together with any costs
and expenses related thereto. Each TRA Party shall promptly provide
the Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo or other applicable withholding agent with any
applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form W-9 or the
applicable version of IRS Form W-8) reasonably requested and shall promptly
provide an update of any such Tax form or certificate previously delivered if
the same has become incorrect or has expired.

  



  

   

27

 



    



   



  

Section 7.11 _Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a
Consolidated Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets_.

  



  

(a) If the Corporate Taxpayer is or becomes a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations that
files a consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Return pursuant to
Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state or
local Tax law, then: (i) the provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be applied
with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments, Early
Termination Payments and other applicable items hereunder shall be computed
with reference to the consolidated, combined or unitary taxable income of the
group as a whole.

  



  

(b) If the Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described
in _Section 7.11(a)_) transfers or is deemed to transfer any Unit or any
Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for United
States federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a group described
in _Section 7.11(a)_) in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in
the property acquired is determined in whole or in part by reference to such
transferor's basis in such property, then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause
such transferee to assume the obligation to make payments hereunder with
respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any Reference Asset
or interest therein acquired (directly or indirectly) in such transfer (taking
into account any gain recognized in the transaction) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this TRA Agreement as the transferee (or one of its
Affiliates) actually realizes Tax benefits from the Tax Attributes.

  



  

(c) If OpCo transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States
federal income Tax purposes) any Reference Asset to a transferee that is
treated as a corporation for United States federal income Tax purposes (other
than a member of a group described in _Section 7.11(a)_) in a transaction in
which the transferee's basis in the property acquired is determined in whole
or in part by reference to such transferor's basis in such property, OpCo
shall be treated as having disposed of the Reference Asset in a
wholly taxable transaction in which income, gain or loss is allocated to the
Corporate Taxpayer in accordance with the LLC Agreement. The consideration
deemed to be received by OpCo in a transaction contemplated in the prior
sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed transferred
asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the case
of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to
such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest. The
transactions described in this _Section 7.11(c)_ and _Section 7.11(e)_ below
shall be taken into account in determining the Realized Tax Benefit or
Realized Tax Detriment, as applicable, for such Taxable Year based on the
income, gain or loss deemed allocated to the Corporate Taxpayer using the Non-
Adjusted Tax Basis of the Reference Assets in calculating its Hypothetical
Tax Liability for such Taxable Year and using the actual Tax basis of the
Reference Assets in calculating its Actual Tax Liability, determined using
the "with and without" methodology. Thus, for example, in determining
the Hypothetical Tax Liability of the Corporate Taxpayer, the taxable income
of the Corporate Taxpayer shall be determined by treating OpCo as having sold
the applicable Reference Asset for its fair market value, recovering any basis
applicable to such Reference Asset (using the Non-Adjusted Tax Basis), while
the Actual Tax Liability of the Corporate Taxpayer would be determined by
recovering the actual Tax basis of the Reference Asset that reflects any
Basis Adjustments.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(d) If any member of a group described in _Section 7.11(a)_ that
owns any Unit deconsolidates from the group (or the Corporate Taxpayer
deconsolidates from the group), then the Corporate Taxpayer shall cause such
member (or the parent of the consolidated group in a case where the Corporate
Taxpayer deconsolidates from the group) to assume the obligation to make
payments hereunder with respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated
with any Reference Asset it owns (directly or indirectly) in a
manner consistent with the terms of this TRA Agreement as the member (or one
of its Affiliates) actually realizes Tax benefits. If a transferee or a
member of a group described in _Section 7.11(a)_ assumes an obligation to
make payments pursuant to this _Section 7.11(d)_, then the initial obligor
is relieved of the obligation assumed.

  



  

(e) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 7.11(d)_, if the
Corporate Taxpayer (or any member of a group described in _Section
7.11(a)_) transfers (or is deemed to transfer for United States federal
income Tax purposes) any Unit in a transaction that is wholly or partially
taxable, then for purposes of calculating payments under this TRA Agreement,
OpCo shall be treated as having disposed of the portion of any Reference
Asset (determined based on a pro rata share of an undivided interest in each
Reference Asset) that is indirectly transferred by the Corporate Taxpayer or
other entity described above ( _i.e._ , taking into account the number of
Units transferred) in a wholly or partially taxable transaction, as
applicable, in which all income, gain or loss is allocated to the Corporate
Taxpayer in accordance with the LLC Agreement. The consideration deemed to be
received by OpCo shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed
transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject,
in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.3_, each TRA Party acknowledges and
agrees that the information of the Corporate Taxpayer is confidential and,
except in the course of performing any duties as necessary for the Corporate
Taxpayer and its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to
enforce the terms of this TRA Agreement, such person shall keep and retain in
confidence and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors or concerning OpCo and
its Affiliates and successors learned by the TRA Party pursuant to this TRA
Agreement. This _Section 7.12_ shall not apply to (i) any information that
has been made publicly available by the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its
Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a result of an act of the TRA
Party in violation of this TRA Agreement) or is generally known and (ii) the
disclosure of information to the extent necessary for the TRA Party to
prepare and file its Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the
same from any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any action,
proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect to such returns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this TRA Agreement, to the extent
required by applicable law or to the extent reasonably necessary for the TRA
Party to comply with any applicable reportable transaction requirements under
applicable law, each TRA Party (and each employee, representative or other
agent of the TRA Party, as applicable) may disclose the Tax treatment and Tax
structure of the Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo and their Affiliates, and any of
their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or
other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA Party relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(b) If a TRA Party breaches any of the provisions of this _Section
7.12_, the Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right to seek to have the
provisions of this _Section 7.12_ specifically enforced by injunctive relief
by any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or
other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach shall
cause irreparable injury to the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Subsidiaries
and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such
Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

  



  

(c) In no event shall this _Section 7.12_ limit any obligation of
any party under the LLC Agreement or the Business Combination Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.13 _TRA Party Representative_. By executing this TRA
Agreement, each of the TRA Parties shall be deemed to have irrevocably
appointed the TRA Party Representative as its agent and attorney in fact with
full power of substitution to act from and after the date hereof and to do
any and all things and execute any and all documents on behalf of such TRA
Parties which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate any
matters under this TRA Agreement, including: (i) execution of the documents
and certificates required pursuant to this TRA Agreement; (ii) except to the
extent provided in this TRA Agreement, receipt and forwarding of notices and
communications pursuant to this TRA Agreement; (iii) administration of
the provisions of this TRA Agreement; (iv) any and all consents, waivers,
amendments or modifications deemed by the TRA Party Representative to be
necessary or appropriate under this TRA Agreement and the execution or
delivery of any documents that may be necessary or appropriate in connection
therewith; (v) taking actions the TRA Party Representative is authorized to
take pursuant to the other provisions of this TRA Agreement; (vi) negotiating
and compromising, on behalf of such TRA Parties, any dispute that may arise
under, and exercising or refraining from exercising any remedies available
under, this TRA Agreement and executing, on behalf of such TRA Parties, any
settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to such
dispute or remedy; and (vii) engaging attorneys, accountants, agents or
consultants on behalf of such TRA Parties in connection with this TRA
Agreement and paying any fees related thereto on behalf of such TRA Parties,
subject to reimbursement by such TRA Parties. The TRA Party Representative
may resign upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Corporate Taxpayer.

Equityholders, the IVP Equityholders, severally and not jointly, agrees
with PubCo to take all Necessary Action to cause (x) the Board to be
comprised of nine (9) directors and (y) those individuals to be nominated in
accordance with this _Article III_, initially (i) three (3) of whom have been

(b) _IVP Equityholder Representation_. For so long as the IVP
Equityholders and their Permitted Transferees Beneficially Own
Economic Interests (in PubCo and the Operating Company, without duplication)
representing the percentage of the Economic Interests held by the IVP
Equityholders immediately after the Closing shown below (or the percentage of
Voting Securities shown below, if relevant), PubCo shall take all Necessary
Action to include in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board for
election as directors at each applicable annual or special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected, that number of individuals
designated by the IVP Representative that, if elected, will result in the IVP
Equityholders having the number of directors serving on the Board that is
shown in the column labeled "Number of IVP Directors" below; provided, that
after the number of IVP Directors is reduced because the percentage
Beneficially Owned of such Economic Interests is reduced, the IVP
Equityholders and their Permitted Transferees cannot subsequently increase
the number of IVP Directors entitled to be designated as a result of their
acquisition of Beneficial Ownership of additional Economic Interests (in
PubCo and the Operating Company, without duplication).

nominees recommended by the Board for election as directors at each applicable
annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected that number of individuals designated by CC Capital (on behalf of the
Sponsor) that, if elected, will result in the Sponsor having the number of
directors serving on the Board that is shown below; provided, that after the
number of Sponsor Directors is reduced because the percentage Beneficially
Owned of such Economic Interests is reduced, the Sponsor and its Permitted
Transferees cannot subsequently increase the number of Sponsor Directors
entitled to be designated as a result of its acquisition of Beneficial
Ownership of additional Economic Interests in PubCo.

applicable, shall take all Necessary Action to cause the appropriate number of
IVP Directors or Sponsor Directors, as applicable, to offer to tender their

discretion and with the express written consent of such individual, recommend
for nomination an IVP Director or Sponsor Director that has tendered his or
her resignation pursuant to this _Section 3.1(d)_.

3.1(d)_, and subject to the Organizational Documents, the IVP
Representative or CC Capital (on behalf of the Sponsor), as applicable, shall
have the exclusive right to (i) remove their nominees from the Board, and
PubCo shall take all Necessary Action to cause the removal of any such nominee
at the request of the applicable Party and (ii) designate directors for
election to the Board to fill vacancies created by reason of death, removal or
resignation of its nominees to the Board, and PubCo, the Sponsor, the Elliott
Equityholders and the IVP Equityholders shall take all Necessary Action to
cause any such vacancies created pursuant to _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above to
be filled by replacement directors designated by the applicable Party as
promptly as practicable after such designation (and in any event prior to the
next meeting or action of the Board or applicable committee). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 3.1(e)_, no Party shall
have the right to designate a replacement director, and PubCo shall not be
required to take any action to cause any vacancy to be filled by any such
designee, to the extent that election or appointment of such designee to the
Board would result in a number of directors nominated by such Party in excess
of the number of directors that such Party is then entitled to nominate for
membership on the Board pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

14

of PubCo and (ii) PubCo shall not amend, alter or repeal any right to

consistent with applicable Law, the last sentence of _Section 10.1(G)_ of
the Certificate of Incorporation, _Article VIII_ of the Certificate of
Incorporation, _Article IV_ of the Bylaws and any indemnification agreements

rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto).

  



  

Section 3.2 _Voting Agreement_. For the Standstill Period, each
of the Sponsor, the Founder Holders and each Equityholder severally and not

Section 3.4 _Sharing of Information_. To the extent permitted by

the directors designated by the Sponsor and the IVP Representative may share
confidential, non-public information about PubCo and its subsidiaries ("
_Confidential Information_ ") with the Sponsor (or the Founder Holders) and
the IVP Equityholders. Further, each Equityholder and the Sponsor recognizes
that it, or its Affiliates, Permitted Transferees and Representatives, has
acquired or will acquire Confidential Information in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise, the use or disclosure of which could cause PubCo
substantial loss and damages that could not be readily calculated and for
which no remedy at Law would be adequate. Accordingly, each Equityholder and
the Sponsor, severally and not jointly, covenants and agrees with PubCo that
it will not (and will cause its respective Affiliates, Permitted
Transferees and Representatives not to) at any time, except with the prior
written consent of PubCo, directly or indirectly, disclose any Confidential
Information known to it to any third party, unless (a) such information
becomes known to the public through no fault of such Party, (b) disclosure is
required by applicable Law or court of competent jurisdiction or requested by
a Governmental Entity; provided that such Party promptly notifies PubCo of
such requirement or request and takes commercially reasonable steps, at the
sole cost and expense of PubCo, to minimize the extent of any such required
disclosure, (c) such information was available or becomes available to such
Party before, on or after the Effective Date, without restriction, from a
source (other than PubCo) without any breach of duty to PubCo or (d) such
information was independently developed by such Party or its Representatives
without the use of the Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit any of the the IVP Equityholders or the Sponsor (or the
Founder Holders) from disclosing Confidential Information to any Affiliate,
Representative, limited partner, member or shareholder of such Party;
provided that such Party shall be responsible for any breach of this _Section
3.3 _by any such Person. No Confidential Information shall be deemed to be
provided to any Person, including any Affiliate of an Equityholder or
Sponsor, unless such Confidential Information is actually provided to such
Person. PubCo and each Equityholder and the Sponsor, severally and not
jointly, acknowledges and agrees with PubCo that each of the Equityholders,
the Sponsor and their respective Affiliates (including CC Capital and NBOKS)
may currently be invested in, may invest in, or may consider investments in
companies that compete either directly or indirectly with PubCo and its
subsidiaries, or operate in the same or similar business as PubCo and its
subsidiaries, and that nothing herein shall be in any way construed to
prohibit or restrict the Equityholders, the Sponsor or their respective
Affiliates' (including CC Capital and NBOKS) ability to maintain, make or
consider such other investments (including purchasing publicly traded
securities). PubCo and each Equityholder and the Sponsor, severally and not
jointly, hereby agrees with PubCo that, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, each of the Equityholders and the Sponsor (other than any
Equityholder that is an employee of PubCo or any of its subsidiaries) and
their respective Affiliates (including CC Capital and NBOKS) shall not be
liable to PubCo, the Sponsor or any other Equityholder for any claim arising
out of, or based upon, (i) the investment by such Equityholder or the
Sponsor, as applicable, or such Party's Affiliates in any entity competitive
with PubCo, or (ii) actions taken by any partner, officer, employee or other
representative of any such Equityholder or the Sponsor, as applicable, or
such Party's Affiliates to assist any such competitive company, whether or not
such action was taken as a member of the board of directors of such
competitive company or otherwise, and whether or not such action has
a detrimental effect on PubCo; provided, however, that (x) no Confidential
Information is used or disclosed in connection with such activities and (y)
the foregoing shall not relieve any director or officer of PubCo from any
liability associated with his or her fiduciary duties to PubCo.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, (1) each of
the IVP Equityholders and the Sponsor, CC Capital and NBOKS (a) may disclose
Confidential Information in connection with routine supervisory audit or
regulatory examinations (including by regulatory or self-regulatory bodies) to
which they are subject in the course of their respective businesses without
liability hereunder and (b) shall not be required to provide notice to any
party in the course of any such routine supervisory audit or regulatory
examination, provided that such routine audit or examination does not
specifically target PubCo, any of its subsidiaries or the Confidential
Information and (2) the Sponsor, CC Capital, NBOKS and each Equityholder that
is a private equity, venture capital or other investment firm and their
respective Affiliates may provide information about the subject matter of
this Agreement to prospective and existing investors in connection with
fund raising, marketing, informational, transactional or reporting
activities.

forth in this _Article III_, PubCo shall place restrictive legends in the
form set forth below on the certificates or book entries representing the
Registrable Securities subject to this Agreement, including any Registrable
Securities Transferred to a Permitted Transferee. Within two (2) Business Days
of PubCo's receiving a request to remove such legend by a Holder or the duly
appointed transfer agent of PubCo, PubCo shall notify the Sponsor and the IVP
Representative of such request in writing, including the number of Registrable
Securities with respect to which such request relates and, if in connection
with a proposed Transfer, the date such Transfer is, or is to be, effected.
All certificates or book entries representing Registrable Securities, as the
case may be, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form:

RIGHTS AGREEMENT, DATED [•], 2020 (THE "INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), BY AND
AMONG [•] (THE "COMPANY"), CC NEUBERGER PRINCIPAL HOLDINGS I SPONSOR LLC AND
THE OTHER PARTIES NAMED THEREIN, AS THE SAME MAY BE AMENDED OR RESTATED FROM
TIME TO TIME (COPIES OF WHICH ARE ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY
AND SHALL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO ANY PARTY MAKING A BONA FIDE REQUEST
THEREFOR). AND NO TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES WILL BE VALID OR EFFECTIVE
UNTIL ANY CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THE INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT, IF ANY, HAVE
BEEN FULFILLED.

Article IV 
 REGISTRATION RIGHTS

(a) _Filing_. PubCo shall file, within thirty (30) days of the
Closing Date, a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form
S-3 (the " _Form S-3 Shelf_"), or if PubCo is ineligible to use a Form S-3
Shelf, a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1 (the "
_Form S-1 Shelf_," and together with the Form S-3 Shelf (and any Subsequent
Shelf Registration), the " _Shelf_ "), in each case, covering the resale of
all Registrable Securities (determined as of two (2) Business Days prior to
such filing) on a delayed or continuous basis. PubCo shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf to become effective under
the Securities Act as soon as practicable after the initial filing thereof.
The Shelf shall provide for the resale of the Registrable Securities included
therein pursuant to any method or combination of methods legally available
to, and requested by, any Special Holder. PubCo shall maintain the Shelf
in accordance with the terms hereof, and shall prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements as may
be necessary to keep such Shelf continuously effective, available for use and
in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as
there are no longer any Registrable Securities. In the event PubCo files a
Form S-1 Shelf, PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
convert the Form S-1 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf Registration) to a Form
S-3 Shelf as soon as practicable after PubCo is eligible to use Form S-3.

  



  

(b) _Subsequent Shelf Registration_. If any Shelf ceases to be
effective under the Securities Act for any reason at any time while there
are any Registrable Securities, PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Shelf to again
become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf), and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly as is reasonably
practicable amend such Shelf in a manner reasonably expected to result in the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf or file an
additional Registration Statement as a Shelf Registration (a " _Subsequent
Shelf Registration_ ") registering the resale of all outstanding Registrable
Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or combination
of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Special Holder. If a
Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, PubCo shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable
after the filing thereof (it being agreed that the Subsequent Shelf
Registration shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if PubCo is
then a Well-Known Seasoned Issuer at the time of filing) and (ii) keep such
Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously effective, available for use and in
compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there
are no longer any Registrable Securities. Any such Subsequent Shelf
Registration shall be on Form S-3 to the extent that PubCo is eligible to use
such form. Otherwise, such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another
appropriate form. In the event that any Holder holds Registrable Securities
that are not registered for resale on a delayed or continuous basis, PubCo,
upon request of a Holder, shall promptly use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the resale of such Registrable Securities to be covered by
either, at PubCo's option, the Shelf (including by means of a post-effective
amendment) or a Subsequent Shelf Registration and cause the same to become
effective as soon as practicable after such filing and such Shelf
or Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be subject to the terms hereof.

(c) _Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. At any time and
from time to time after the Shelf has been declared effective by the SEC, the
Special Holders may request (each, a " _Shelf Takedown Request_ ") to sell all
or any portion of their Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering
that is registered pursuant to the Shelf (each, an " _Underwritten Shelf
Takedown_ "); provided that PubCo shall only be obligated to effect an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown if such offering (i) shall include
securities with a total offering price (exclusive of piggyback securities and
before deduction of underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in
the aggregate, $10.0 million (the " _Minimum Takedown Threshold_ ") or (ii)
shall be made with respect to all of the Registrable Securities of the
Demanding Holder, provided that any request for an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to this _clause (ii)_ made by the Sponsor Representative
as representative of the Founder Holders, shall apply to all Registrable
Securities then held by the Founder Holders. All requests for Underwritten
Shelf Takedowns shall be made by giving written notice to PubCo, which shall
specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold
in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the expected price range of such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that each Holder agrees that the fact
that such a notice has been delivered shall constitute Confidential
Information subject to _Section 3.3_. The Special Holders that requested
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (the " _Demanding Holders_ ") shall have
the right to select the Underwriters for such offering (which shall consist
of one or more reputable nationally or regionally recognized investment
banks), and to agree to the pricing and other terms of such offering; provided
that such selection shall be subject to the consent of PubCo, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall any Special Holder or any
Transferee thereof request an Underwritten Shelf Takedown during the Lock-Up
Period. There shall be no limit to the number of Underwritten Shelf Takedowns
that may be requested by any Special Holder, subject to the proviso in the
first sentence of this _Section 4.1(c)_.

  



  

(d) _Shelf Takedown Participation_. Promptly upon receipt of a
Shelf Takedown Request (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
thereafter (or more than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter in connection with
an underwritten "block trade")) for any Underwritten Shelf Takedown, PubCo
shall deliver a notice (a " _Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") to each other Special
Holder with Registrable Securities covered by the applicable Registration
Statement (each, a " _Potential Takedown Participant_ "). The Shelf Takedown
Notice shall offer each such Potential Takedown Participant the opportunity to
include in any Underwritten Shelf Takedown such number of Registrable
Securities as each such Potential Takedown Participant may request in
writing. PubCo shall include in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown all such
Registrable Securities with respect to which PubCo has received written
requests for inclusion therein within three (3) Business Days (or within
twenty-four (24) hours in connection with an underwritten "block trade")
after the date that the Shelf Takedown Notice has been delivered. Any
Potential Takedown Participant's request to participate in an Underwritten
Shelf Takedown shall be binding on the Potential Takedown Participant;
provided that each such Potential Takedown Participant that elects to
participate may condition its participation on the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown being completed within ten (10) Business Days of its acceptance at a
price per share (after giving effect to any underwriters' discounts or
commissions) to such Potential Takedown Participant of not less than a
percentage of the closing price for the shares on their principal trading
market on the Business Day immediately prior to such Potential
Takedown Participant's election to participate, as specified in such
Potential Takedown Participant's request to participate in such Underwritten
Shelf Takedown (the " _Participation Conditions_ "). Notwithstanding the
delivery of any Shelf Takedown Notice, but subject to the Participation
Conditions (to the extent applicable), all determinations as to whether to
complete any Underwritten Shelf Takedown and as to the timing, manner, price
and other terms of any Underwritten Shelf Takedown contemplated by this
_Section 4.1(d)_ shall be determined by the Requesting Holder.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(e) _Reduction of Underwritten Shelf Takedowns_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good
faith, advise PubCo, the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if
any) in writing that the dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities
that the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell,
taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other Equity
Securities that PubCo desires to sell and all other Common Stock or other
Equity Securities, if any, that have been requested to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback
registration rights held by any other stockholders, exceeds the maximum
dollar amount or maximum number of Equity Securities that can be sold in the
Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then PubCo shall include
in such Underwritten Offering, as follows: at all times (i) first, the
Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if
any) (pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that
each Demanding Holder and Requesting Holder (if any) has requested be included
in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown) that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (ii) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing _clause
(i)_ , the Common Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to
sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , the Common Stock
or other Equity Securities of other Persons that PubCo is obligated to include
in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such Persons and that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

(f) _Withdrawal_. Any of the Demanding Holders initiating an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall have the right to withdraw from such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification (a " _Withdrawal Notice_ ") to PubCo and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of such Demanding Holder's intention to withdraw from
such Underwritten Shelf Takedown, prior to the public announcement of the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown by PubCo; provided that a Special Holder may elect
to have PubCo continue an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if the Minimum Takedown
Threshold would still be satisfied or if the Underwritten Shelf Takedown
would be made with respect to all of the Registrable Securities of such
Special Holder. Following the receipt of any Withdrawal Notice, PubCo shall
promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice to any other Special Holders that had
elected to participate in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, PubCo shall be responsible for the
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown prior to delivery of a Withdrawal Notice under this _Section
4.1(f)_.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(g) _Long-Form Demands_. Upon the expiration of the Lock-Up
Period and during such times as no Shelf is effective, each Special Holder may
demand that PubCo file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the purpose
of conducting an Underwritten Offering of any or all of such Special Holder's
Registrable Securities. PubCo shall file such Registration Statement within
thirty (30) days of receipt of such demand and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the same to be declared effective within sixty
(60) days of filing. The provisions of _Sections 4.1(c)-(f)_ shall apply to
this _Section 4.1(g)_ as if a demand under this  _Section 4.1(g)_ were an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that in order to withdraw a demand under
this _Section 4.1(g)_, such withdrawal must be received by PubCo prior to
PubCo having publicly filed a Registration Statement pursuant to this _Section
4.1(g)_.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) _Piggyback Rights_. If PubCo or any Special Holder proposes
to conduct a registered offering of, or if PubCo proposes to file a
Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect to an offering
of Equity Securities of PubCo, or securities or other obligations exercisable
or exchangeable for, or convertible into Equity Securities of PubCo, for its
own account or for the account of stockholders of PubCo, other than a
Registration Statement (or any registered offering with respect thereto) (i)
filed in connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan,
(ii) for an exchange offer or offering of securities solely to
PubCo's existing stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is
convertible into equity securities of PubCo or (iv) for a dividend
reinvestment plan, then PubCo shall give written notice of such proposed
offering to all Special Holders as soon as practicable but not less than
three (3) calendar days before the anticipated filing date of such
Registration Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering pursuant
to a Shelf Registration, the launch date of such offering, which notice
shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such
offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the
proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any and if known, in such
offering, and (B) offer to all of the Special Holders the opportunity to
include in such registered offering such number of Registrable Securities as
such Special Holders may request in writing within two (2) calendar days
after receipt of such written notice (such registered offering, a "
_Piggyback Registration_ "); provided that each Special Holder agrees with
PubCo that the fact that such a notice has been delivered shall constitute
Confidential Information subject to _Section 3.3_. PubCo shall cause such
Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable
Securities requested by the Special Holders pursuant to this _Section
4.2(a)_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms
and conditions as any similar securities of PubCo included in such registered
offering and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
The inclusion of any Special Holder's Registrable Securities in a Piggyback
Registration shall be subject to such Special Holder's agreement to abide by
the terms of _Section 4.6_ below.

  



  

   

22

 



    



  

(b) _Reduction of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering that is to be a
Piggyback Registration (other than an Underwritten Shelf Takedown), in good
faith, advises PubCo and the Special Holders participating in the Piggyback
Registration in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, taken together
with (i) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to which
Registration or a registered offering has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with Persons other than the Special Holders
hereunder and (ii) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to
which registration has been requested pursuant to this _Section 4.2_,
exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

  



  

(i) If the Registration is initiated and undertaken for PubCo's
account, PubCo shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
_clause (A)_ , the Registrable Securities of Special Holders exercising their
rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section 4.2(a)_
(pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each
Special Holder has requested be included in such Registration), which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (C) third, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Common Stock or other Equity
Securities, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to
written contractual piggyback registration rights of other stockholders of
PubCo, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; or

  



  

(ii) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by Persons other
than the Special Holders, then PubCo shall include in any such
Registration (A) first, the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any,
of such requesting Persons, other than the Special Holders, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing _clause (A)_ , the Registrable Securities of Special Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Section 4.2(a)_ (pro rata based on the respective number of Registrable
Securities that each Special Holder has requested be included in such
Registration) which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has
not been reached under the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and (D) fourth, to
the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under
the foregoing _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_ and _(C)_ , the Common Stock or other
Equity Securities, if any, for the account of other Persons that PubCo is
obligated to register pursuant to separate written contractual piggyback
registration rights of such Persons, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.2(b)_, in the
event a Demanding Holder has submitted notice for a bona fide
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and all sales pursuant to such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to _Section 4.1_ have not been effected in accordance with
the applicable plan of distribution or submitted a Withdrawal Notice prior to
such time that PubCo has given written notice of a Piggyback Registration to
all Special Holders pursuant to this _Section 4.2_, then any reduction in
the number of Registrable Securities to be offered in such offering shall be
determined in accordance with _Section 4.1(e)_, instead of this _Section
4.2(b)_.

  



  

   

23

 



    



  

(c) _Piggyback Registration Withdrawal_. Any Special Holder shall
have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no
reason whatsoever upon written notification to PubCo and the Underwriter or
Underwriters (if any) of such Special Holder's intention to withdraw from
such Piggyback Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with the SEC with respect to such Piggyback Registration or,
in the case of a Piggyback Registration pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the
filing of the applicable "red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement
with respect to such Piggyback Registration used for marketing such
transaction. PubCo (whether on its own good faith determination or as the
result of a request for withdrawal by Persons pursuant to separate written
contractual obligations) may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the
SEC in connection with a Piggyback Registration (which, in no circumstance,
shall include the Shelf) at any time prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, PubCo shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal under
this _Section 4.2(c)_.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Restriction on Transfer_. In connection with any
Underwritten Offering of Equity Securities of PubCo, (i) each Holder that
holds more than 1.0% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock (after giving
effect to the exchange of all outstanding Company Units), agrees that it
shall not Transfer any Common Stock (other than those included in such
offering pursuant to this Agreement), without the prior written consent of
PubCo, during the seven (7) days prior to and the 90-day period beginning on
the date of pricing of such offering, except in the event the Underwriter
managing the offering otherwise agrees by written consent, and further
agrees to execute a customary lock-up agreement in favor of the Underwriter
or Underwriters to such effect (in each case on substantially the same terms
and conditions as all such Holders) and (ii) PubCo will cause each of its
directors and officers to execute a lock-up on terms at least as restrictive
as that contemplated by the preceding _clause (i)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Holder shall not be subject to this _Section 4.3_ with respect
to an Underwritten Offering unless each Holder that holds at least 1.0% of
the issued and outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect to the exchange
of all outstanding Company Units) and each of PubCo's directors and officers
have executed a lock-up on terms at least as restrictive with respect to such
Underwritten Offering as requested of the Holders.

  



  

Section 4.4 _General Procedures_. In connection with effecting
any Registration and/or Shelf Takedown, subject to applicable Law and any
regulations promulgated by any securities exchange on which PubCo's Equity
Securities are then listed, each as interpreted by PubCo with the advice of
its counsel, PubCo shall use its reasonable best efforts (except as set forth
in _clause (d)_ below) to effect such Registration to permit the sale of the
Registrable Securities included in such Registration in accordance with the
intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto PubCo shall, as
expeditiously as possible:

  



  

(a) prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold;

  



  

   

24

 



    



  

(b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-
effective amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to
the Prospectus, as may be reasonably requested by any Special Holder or as
may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to the
registration form used by PubCo or by the Securities Act or rules and
regulations thereunder to keep the Registration Statement effective until all
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement are sold in
accordance with the intended plan of distribution set forth in such
Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

(c) prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the
Underwriters, if any, and the Special Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration, and such Special Holders' legal counsel, if
any, copies of such Registration Statement as proposed to be filed, each
amendment and supplement to such Registration Statement (in each case
including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference
therein), the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including
each preliminary Prospectus), and such other documents as the Underwriters or
the Special Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration
or the legal counsel for any such Special Holders, if any, may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such Special Holders;

  



  

(d) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use
its best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or
"blue sky" Laws of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of
their intended plan of distribution) may request (or provide evidence
satisfactory to such Holders that the Registrable Securities are exempt from
such registration or qualification) and (ii) take such action necessary to
cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other Governmental Entities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of PubCo and do any and
all other acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the
Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; provided, however, that PubCo shall not be required to qualify
generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to general
service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then
otherwise so subject;

  



  

(e) cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which similar
securities issued by PubCo are then listed;

  



  

(f) provide a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and
registrar for all such Registrable Securities no later than the
effective date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

(g) advise each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a
Registration Statement, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain
knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending
the effectiveness of such Registration Statement or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and promptly use its reasonable
best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its
withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

  



  

   

25

 



    



  

(h) at least three (3) calendar days prior to the filing of any
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document that is to be
incorporated by reference into such Registration Statement or Prospectus
furnish a draft thereof to each Special Holder of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement, or its counsel, if any (excluding
any exhibits thereto and any filing made under the Exchange Act that is to be
incorporated by reference therein);

  



  

(i) notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to
such Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes a Misstatement, and then to correct such Misstatement as set
forth in _Section 4.7_ hereof;

  



  

(j) permit Representatives of the Special Holders, the
Underwriters, if any, and any attorney, consultant or accountant retained by
such Special Holders or Underwriter to participate, at each such Person's own
expense except to the extent such expenses constitute Registration Expenses,
in the preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause PubCo's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such Representative, Underwriter, attorney, consultant or accountant in
connection with the Registration; provided, however, that such Persons agree
to confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to PubCo, prior to
the release or disclosure of any such information;

  



  

(k) obtain a "cold comfort" letter, and a bring-down thereof, from
PubCo's independent registered public accountants in the event of an
Underwritten Offering which the participating Special Holders may rely on, in
customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by
"cold comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably
request, and reasonably satisfactory to the participating Special Holders;

  



  

(l) on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale
pursuant to such Registration, obtain an opinion and negative
assurances letter, dated such date, of counsel representing PubCo for the
purposes of such Registration, addressed to the Special Holders, the
placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering
such legal matters with respect to the Registration in respect of which such
opinion is being given as the Special Holders, placement agent, sales agent,
or Underwriter may reasonably request and as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to the
participating Special Holders;

  



  

(m) in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and
customary form, with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

(n) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement which satisfies the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any successor rule
promulgated thereafter by the SEC);

  



  

(o) if an Underwritten Offering involves Registrable Securities
with a total offering price (including piggyback securities and
before deduction of underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in
the aggregate, $50.0 million, use its reasonable best efforts to make
available senior executives of PubCo to participate in customary "road show"
presentations that may be reasonably requested by the Underwriter in such
Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(p) otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take
such customary actions as may reasonably be requested, by the Special
Holders, in connection with such Registration.

  



  

Section 4.5 _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses
of all Registrations shall be borne by PubCo. It is acknowledged by the
Holders that the Holders selling any Registrable Securities in an offering
shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of
Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters' commissions and discounts,
brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set forth in
the definition of "Registration Expenses," all reasonable fees and expenses of
any legal counsel representing such Holders, in each case pro rata based on
the number of Registrable Securities that such Holders have sold in such
Registration.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Requirements for Participating in Underwritten
Offerings_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any
Holder does not provide PubCo with its requested Holder Information, PubCo
may exclude such Holder's Registrable Securities from the applicable
Registration Statement or Prospectus if PubCo determines, based on the advice
of counsel, that such information is necessary to effect the registration and
such Holder continues thereafter to withhold such information. No Person may
participate in any Underwritten Offering of Equity Securities of PubCo
pursuant to a Registration hereunder unless such Person (a) agrees to sell
such Person's Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting
and other arrangements approved by PubCo in the case of an Underwritten
Offering initiated by PubCo, and approved by the Demanding Holders in the case
of an Underwritten Offering initiated by the Demanding Holders and (b)
completes and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other
customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting arrangements. Subject to the minimum thresholds set forth in
_Section 4.1(c)_ and _Section 4.4(o)_ of this Agreement, the exclusion of a
Holder's Registrable Securities as a result of this _Section 4.6_ shall
not affect the registration of the other Registrable Securities to be
included in such Registration.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon
receipt of written notice from PubCo that a Registration Statement or
Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has received
copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement
(and PubCo hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement or amendment
as soon as practicable after giving such notice), or until it is advised in
writing by PubCo that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in
respect of any Registration at any time would require PubCo to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to PubCo for reasons
beyond PubCo's control, PubCo may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time,
but in no event more than ninety (90) days in any 12-month period, determined
in good faith by PubCo to be necessary for such purpose. In the event PubCo
exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the Holders agree to
suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, their
use of the Prospectus relating to such Registration in connection with any
sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities. PubCo shall immediately notify
the Holders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised its
rights under this _Section 4.7_.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

Section 4.8 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall
own Registrable Securities, PubCo, at all times while it shall be a reporting
company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain
extensions in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace period)
all reports required to be filed by PubCo after the Effective Date pursuant to
Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the
Holders with true and complete copies of all such filings; provided, that any
documents publicly filed or furnished with the SEC pursuant to the Electronic
Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System shall be deemed to have been
furnished to the Holders pursuant to this _Section 4.8_.

  



  

Section 4.9 _Other Obligations_. In connection with a Transfer
of Registrable Securities exempt from Section 5 of the Securities Act or
through any broker-dealer transactions described in the plan of distribution
set forth within the Prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of
which such Prospectus forms a part, PubCo shall, subject to applicable Law, as
interpreted by PubCo with the advice of counsel, and the receipt of any
customary documentation required from the applicable Holders in connection
therewith, (a) promptly instruct its transfer agent to remove any restrictive
legends applicable to the Registrable Securities being Transferred and (b)
cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any, to
the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under  _clause (a)_. In
addition, PubCo shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary
actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection with the
aforementioned Transfers; provided, however, that PubCo shall have no
obligation to participate in any "road shows" or assist with the preparation
of any offering memoranda or related documentation with respect to any
Transfer of Registrable Securities in any transaction that does not constitute
an Underwritten Offering.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Indemnification and Contribution_.

  



  

(a) PubCo agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by Law,
each Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers, managers, directors
and Representatives and each Person who controls such Holder (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) caused by, resulting
from, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii)
any violation or alleged violation by PubCo of the Securities Act or any
other similar federal or state securities Laws, except in each case insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing
to PubCo by such Holder expressly for use therein. PubCo shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing sentence with respect to the indemnification of each
Holder.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a
Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall
furnish to PubCo in writing such information and affidavits as PubCo
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus (the " _Holder Information_ ") and, to
the extent permitted by Law, such Holder shall indemnify PubCo, its directors
and officers and each Person who controls PubCo (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or
preliminary Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such
untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so
furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use therein; provided,
however, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Holders of Registrable Securities, and the liability of
each such Holder of Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and
limited to the net proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders
of Registrable Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each Person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing
sentence with respect to indemnification of PubCo.

  



  

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this _Section
4.10_ shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any
claim with respect to which such Person seeks indemnification (provided that
the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person's right to
indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not materially
prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified
party's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim,
permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense is
assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying
party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a
claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect
to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other
of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim. No indemnifying party
shall, without the consent of the indemnified party, consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement which cannot be settled in all
respects by the payment of money (and such money is so paid by the
indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such settlement) or which
settlement does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any [officer, manager, director, Representative or
controlling Person] of such indemnified party and shall survive the Transfer
of securities.

  



  

   

29

 



    



  

(e) If the indemnification provided in this _Section 4.10_ from
the indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; provided, however, that the
liability of any Holder under this _Section 4.10(e)_ shall be limited to the
amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a Party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 4.10(a)_ , _4.10(b)_ and
_4.10(c)_ , any legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred
by such Party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The Parties
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this _Section 4.10(e)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by
any other method of allocation, which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in this _Section 4.10(e)_. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to this _Section
4.10(e)_ from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

  



  

Section 4.11 _Other Registration Rights_. Other than the
registration rights set forth in the Forward Purchase Agreement, the Backstop
Agreement and the Subscription Agreements (as defined in the BCA), PubCo
represents and warrants that no Person, other than a Holder of Registrable
Securities pursuant hereto, has any right to require PubCo to register any
securities of PubCo for sale or to include such securities of PubCo in any
Registration Statement filed by PubCo for the sale of securities for its own
account or for the account of any other Person. Further, each of PubCo, the
Sponsor and the Sponsor Representative represents and warrants that
this Agreement supersedes any other registration rights agreement or other
similar agreement, other than the registration rights set forth in the
Forward Purchase Agreement, the Backstop Agreement and the Subscription
Agreements.

  



  

Section 4.12 _Rule 144_. With a view to making available to the
Holders the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, PubCo
covenants that it will (a) make available at all times information necessary
to comply with Rule 144, if such Rule is available with respect to resales of
the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, and (b) take such further
action as the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable them to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (if available with
respect to resales of the Registrable Securities), as such rule may be amended
from time to time. Upon the reasonable request of any Holder, PubCo will
deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether PubCo has complied
with such information requirements, and, if not, the specific reasons for
non-compliance.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

Section 4.13 _Term_.  _Article IV_ shall terminate with respect
to any Holder on the date that such Holder no longer holds any
Registrable Securities. The provisions of _Section 4.8_ and _Section 4.10_
shall survive any such termination with respect to such Holder.

  



  

Section 4.14 _Holder Information_. Each Holder agrees, if
requested in writing by PubCo, to represent to PubCo the total number of
Registrable Securities held by such Holder in order for PubCo to make
determinations hereunder, including for purposes of _Section 4.12_ hereof.

  



  

Section 4.15 _Termination of Original RRA_. Upon the Closing,
PubCo, the Sponsor and the CCNB1 Independent Directors hereby agree that the
Original RRA and all of the respective rights and obligations of the parties
thereunder are hereby terminated in their entirety and shall be of no further
force or effect.

  



  

Section 4.16 _Distributions_.

  



  

(a) In the event that, pursuant to a dissolution of the Sponsor,
the Sponsor distributes all of its Registrable Securities to its members, the
Founder Holders shall be treated as the Sponsor hereunder; provided, that such
Founder Holders, taken as a whole, shall not be entitled to rights in excess
of those conferred on the Sponsor, as if the Sponsor remained a single entity
party to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event that any Elliott Equityholder (i) distributes all
of its Registrable Securities to its direct equity holders or (ii)
contributes all of its Registrable Securities to a controlled Affiliate, which
Affiliate must be a Permitted Transferee, such distributees or contributees,
as applicable, shall be treated as such Elliott Equityholder hereunder;
provided, that such distributees or contributees, taken as a whole, shall not
be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred on the Elliott
Equityholders, as if they remained a single party to this Agreement.

  



  

(c) In the event that any IVP Equityholder (i) distributes all of
its Registrable Securities to its direct equity holders or (ii)
contributes all of its Registrable Securities to a controlled Affiliate,
which Affiliate must be a Permitted Transferee, such distributees or
contributees, as applicable, shall be treated as such IVP Equityholder
hereunder; provided, that only the IVP Representative shall be entitled to
take any action hereunder that any such IVP Equityholder is entitled to take;
provided, further, that such distributees or contributees, taken as a whole,
shall not be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred on the IVP
Equityholders, as if they remained a single party to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 4.17 _Adjustments_. If there are any changes in the Common
Stock as a result of stock split, stock dividend, combination or
reclassification, or through merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other
similar event, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions of
this Agreement, as may be required, so that the rights, privileges, duties
and obligations hereunder shall continue with respect to the Common Stock as
so changed.

Article V 
 LOCK-UP

  



  

Section 5.1 _Lock-Up_.

  



  

(a) Other than pursuant to the LLC Agreement, no Special Holder
(including any Founder Holder), other Equityholder or CCNB1
Independent Director shall Transfer, or make a public announcement of any
intention to effect such Transfer, of any Lock-Up Shares (as defined below)
Beneficially Owned or otherwise held by such Person during the Lock-Up Period
(as defined below); provided, that such prohibition shall not apply to
Transfers permitted pursuant to _Section 5.2_. The " _Lock-Up Period_ " shall
be the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is
six (6) months following the Closing Date. The " _Lock-Up Shares_ " means (i)
the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class V Common Stock, Common
Units and Restricted Common Units held by the Special Holders, the
Equityholders or the CCNB1 Independent Directors as of the Closing Date, and
(ii) shares of Class A Common Stock issued pursuant to the LLC Agreement upon
exchange of Company Units held as of the Closing Date, along with an equal
number of Class V Common Stock, for Class A Common Stock; provided
however that (w) any Equity Securities purchased by NBOKS or any Founder
Holder (or Affiliate thereof) pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement or
any other forward purchase agreement entered into with PubCo in connection
with PubCo's initial public offering, (x) any Equity Securities purchased by
NBOKS or any Affiliate of NBOKS in connection with that certain Backstop
Agreement, by and between PubCo and NBOKS, dated as of October 14, 2020; (y)
any Equity Securities issued pursuant to any Subscription Agreement (as
defined in the BCA) entered into with PubCo in connection with the entry into
the BCA (including any such agreement entered into by CC Capital or any of
its Affiliates) and (z) any warrants to purchase Class A Common Stock or any
Class A Common Stock underlying such warrants, shall not be "Lock-Up Shares"
under this Agreement.

  



  

(b) During the Lock-Up Period, any purported Transfer of Lock-Up
Shares other than in accordance with this Agreement shall be null and
void, and PubCo shall refuse to recognize any such Transfer for any purpose.

  



  

(c) The Special Holders, the other Equityholders and the CCNB1
Independent Directors acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Equity Securities in the Operating Company (including
Common Units and Restricted Common Units), shares of Class V Common Stock and
shares of Class A Common Stock, in each case, Beneficially Owned by such
Person shall remain subject to any restrictions on Transfer under applicable
securities Laws of any Governmental Entity, including all applicable
holding periods under the Securities Act and other rules of the SEC, and
under the LLC Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Permitted Transfers_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, during the Lock-Up Period, the
Special Holders, other Equityholders and the CCNB1 Independent Directors may
Transfer, without the consent of PubCo, any of such Person's Lock-Up Shares
to (i) any of such Person's Permitted Transferees, upon written notice to
PubCo and, in the case of such a Transfer by the Sponsor (including a Founder
Holder), also to the IVP Representative, and in the case of such a
Transfer by (x) an Elliott Equityholder or its Permitted Transferees or (y)
an IVP Equityholder or its Permitted Transferees, also to the Sponsor or (ii)
(a) a charitable organization, upon written notice to PubCo and, in the case
of such a Transfer by the Sponsor (including a Founder Holder) also to the
IVP Representative, and in the case of such a Transfer by (I) an Elliott
Equityholder or its Permitted Transferees or (II) an IVP Equityholder or its
Permitted Transferees, also to the Sponsor; (b) in the case of an individual,
by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual;
(c) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations
order; or (d) pursuant to any liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other
similar transaction which results in all of PubCo's stockholders having the
right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for cash, securities or other
property subsequent to the Business Combination; provided, that in
connection with any Transfer of such Lock-Up Shares pursuant to _clause (ii)_
above, (x) the restrictions and obligations contained in _Section 5.1_ and
this _Section 5.2_ will continue to apply to such Lock-Up Shares after
any Transfer of such Lock-Up Shares, and (y) the Transferee of such Lock-Up
Shares shall have no rights under this Agreement, unless, for the avoidance
of doubt, such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee in accordance with this
Agreement. Any Transferee of Lock-Up Shares who is a Permitted Transferee of
the Transferor pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be required, at the time
of and as a condition to such Transfer, to become a party to this Agreement by
executing and delivering a joinder in the form attached to this Agreement as
__Exhibit A__, whereupon such Transferee will be treated as a Party
(with the same rights and obligations as the Transferor) for all purposes of
this Agreement.

Article VI 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 6.1 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party
Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise permitted hereunder, no Party may assign
such Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of PubCo and the IVP Representative
(for so long as the IVP Representative has the right to appoint a nominee to
the Board), in the case of an assignment by the Sponsor (including a Founder
Holder) or a CCNB1 Independent Director, or the Sponsor (for so long as CC
Capital (on behalf of the Sponsor) has the right to appoint a nominee to the
Board), in the case of an assignment by an Equityholder. Any such assignee
may not again assign those rights, other than in accordance with this
_Article VI_. Any attempted assignment of rights or obligations in violation
of this _Article VI_ shall be null and void.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (other than
the succeeding sentence of this _Section 6.1(b)_), no Holder may
Transfer such Holder's rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or in part, except in connection with a Transfer of such Holder's Registrable
Securities, in whole or in part, to (a) any Person with the prior written
consent of PubCo or (b) any of such Holder's Permitted Transferees. In no
event can the Sponsor (including the Founder Holders), the Equityholders
or the IVP Representative assign any of such Person's rights under _Section
3.1_. Any Transferee of Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section
6.1(b)_ shall be required, at the time of and as a condition to such Transfer,
to become a party to this Agreement, whereupon such Transferee will be
treated as a Party (with the same rights and obligations as the
Transferor) for all purposes of this Agreement, as applicable and to the
extent in accordance with this _Section 6.1(b)_.

  



  

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon the Parties and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and
representatives, but shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
successors, assigns, heirs and representatives of any Party only to the
extent that they are permitted successors, assigns, heirs and representatives
pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, 
_Section 3.4_ and _Section 5.1_ shall only inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by (i) PubCo (with respect to each other Party) and (ii) each
other Party (with respect to PubCo's obligations to such other Party,
as applicable).

  



  

  

   

33

 



    



   



  

(d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Party, other than the Parties and their respective
permitted successors, assigns, heirs and representatives, any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise create any third party beneficiary
hereto.

  



  

Section 6.2   _Termination_. _Section 3.1_ shall terminate in
accordance with its terms. _Sections 3.2_ and _3.3_ shall terminate at the
end of the Standstill Period. _Article IV_ of this Agreement shall terminate
as set forth in _Section 4.13_. The remainder of this Agreement shall
terminate automatically (without any action by any Party) as to each Holder
when such Holder ceases to hold any Registrable Securities; provided, that, a
Party may elect to terminate all of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement prior to such time (which termination shall terminate such Party's
rights under _Section 6.4(b)_, but shall not, for the avoidance of doubt,
terminate such Party's obligations under _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_,
_Section 3.3_, _Article V _and _Article VI_).

  



  

Section 6.3   _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement
is determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental
Entity, the remaining provisions hereof, to the extent permitted by Law shall
remain in full force and effect.

  



  

Section   6.4 _ Entire Agreement; Amendments; No Waiver_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement, together with __Exhibit A__ to this
Agreement, the BCA, the LLC Agreement, and all other Ancillary Agreements (as
such term is defined in the BCA), constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings and discussions,
whether oral or written, relating to such subject matter in any way and there
are no warranties, representations or other agreements among the Parties in
connection with such subject matter except as set forth in this Agreement and
therein.

  



  

(b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified in
whole or in part at any time without the express written consent of (i)
PubCo, (ii) for so long as the IVP Equityholders and their Permitted
Transferees collectively Beneficially Own Economic Interests (in the
Operating Company and PubCo, without duplication) representing 20% or more of
the Economic Interests held by the IVP Equityholders immediately after the
Closing, the IVP Representative, and (iii) for so long as the Sponsor and its
Permitted Transferees collectively Beneficially Own Economic Interests in
PubCo representing 20% or more of the Economic Interests held by the
Sponsor immediately after the Closing, the Sponsor Representative; provided
that any such amendment or modification that would be materially adverse in
any respect to any Holder shall require the prior written consent of such
Holder; provided, further that a provision that has terminated with respect
to a Party shall not require any consent of such Party (and such Party's
Economic Interests shall not be considered in computing any percentages) with
respect to amending or modifying such provision.

  



  

   

34

 



    



  

(c) No waiver of any provision or default under, nor consent to
any exception to, the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless in
writing and signed by the Party to be bound and then only to the specific
purpose, extent and instance so provided.

  

  

  



  

Section 6.5 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and
any other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more
counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic transmission, each of
which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement. No Party shall raise the use of a fax machine or email to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a fax machine or email as
a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each Party
forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Notices_.  All notices, demands and other
communications to be given or delivered under this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when personally delivered

Business Day and, if otherwise, on the next Business Day, (b) one (1)
Business Day following sending by reputable overnight express courier (charges

Section 6.7 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_.
The Law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Actions, claims or
matters related to or arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-
contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction,
interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Agreement, and the
performance of the obligations imposed by this Agreement, in each case
without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or
provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN
OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS
ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES
FURTHER WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH
PARTY'S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH
PARTY'S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of
the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the
Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the
Action shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to
bring any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
courts. Nothing in this _Section 6.7_, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at
equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Action so brought shall
be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law or at equity.

  

  



  

Section 6.8 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees and
acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that
would be suffered if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations
imposed on them by this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure,
an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not have an adequate
remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled (in addition to
any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or in equity) to
injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce such
obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Action should be
brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, none of
the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Subsequent Acquisition of Shares_. Any Equity
Securities of PubCo or Operating Company acquired subsequent to the Effective
Date by a Holder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and such shares shall be considered to be "Registrable
Securities" as such term is used in this Agreement.

BY-LAWS 
 

  

OF 
 

  

E2OPEN PARENT HOLDINGS, INC.

  



  

Article I. 
 STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

Section 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of E2open Parent
Holdings, Inc. (the " _Corporation_ ") for the purpose of electing directors
and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought
before the meeting shall be held on such date, and at such time and place, if
any, within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of
remote communications pursuant to paragraph (C)(2) of Section 12, as may be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board_ "). The Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel any
annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled.

  



  

Section 2. Except as otherwise required by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") or the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), and
subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of Preferred
Stock (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), special meetings of
the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at the direction
of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation. Special meetings may be held either at a place, within or without
the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communications pursuant to
paragraph (C)(2) of Section 12 as the Board may determine. The Board may
postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting of the stockholders
previously scheduled.

  



  

Section 3. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of the date, time, place
(if any), the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for stockholders
entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special meeting, the
purpose or purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be given not more
than sixty (60), nor less than ten (10), days previous thereto (unless
a different time is specified by applicable law), to each stockholder
entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as
it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner by
which notices of meetings otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders,
any such notice may be given by electronic transmission in the manner
provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 4. The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the
stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise
provided herein, by applicable law or by the Certificate of Incorporation;
but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum
present, the chairman of the meeting or, by a majority in voting power
thereof, the stockholders present (either in person or by proxy) may, to the
extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if
any, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders may
be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, until a
quorum shall be present or represented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where
a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or
classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. At
any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented by
proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. Notice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the
time, date and place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any,
by which stockholders may be deemed present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of
such adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to
each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of
the record date for notice of such adjourned meeting.

  



  

   

 



    



  

Section 5. The Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of the
Chairman of the Board or at the Chairman of the Board's direction, the
Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer's absence or at
the Chief Executive Officer's direction, any officer of the Corporation shall
call all meetings of the stockholders to order and shall act as chairman of
any such meetings. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in such officer's
absence, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting. If
neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman of
the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. The Board may adopt
such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as
it shall deem appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the Board prior to
the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine the order of business
and shall have the authority in his or her discretion to regulate the conduct
of any such meeting, including, without limitation, convening the meeting and
adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), announcing the
date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter
upon which the stockholders will vote, imposing restrictions on the persons
(other than stockholders of record of the Corporation or their duly appointed
proxies) who may attend any such meeting, establishing procedures for
the transaction of business at the meeting (including the dismissal of
business not properly presented), maintaining order at the meeting and safety
of those present, restricting entry to the meeting after the time fixed for
commencement thereof and limiting the circumstances in which any person may
make a statement or ask questions at any meeting of stockholders. Unless and
to the extent determined by the Board or the chairman over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

  



  

Section 6. At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled
to vote thereat shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, subject to
applicable law. Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may
authorize another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy
pursuant to the DGCL, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a
stockholder may grant such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing
authorizing another person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and
execution of the writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the
stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such
writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or
(2) a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing by means of electronic
transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a
proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent
duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive
such transmission, provided that any such means of electronic transmission
must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
If it is determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the
inspector or inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such
inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall specify the
information upon which they relied.

  



  

A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and
only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support
an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date.

  



  

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this
Section 6 (including any electronic transmission) may be substituted or used
in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for
which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

  



  

Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the
commencement of the meeting to which they relate.

  



  

Section 7. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the votes cast ( _provided_ that an abstention or
broker non-vote shall not count as a vote cast) shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the DGCL a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required
and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast
( _provided_ that an abstention or broker non-vote shall not count as a vote
cast) by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act
of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon
which by express provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-Laws
or the DGCL a different vote is required, in which case such express
provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.

Section 8. (A) In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required
by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the
date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such
meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date,
that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for
making such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided, however_ , that the Board may fix a new record date for
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and
in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to
notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at
the adjourned meeting.

  



  



  

 (B) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 9. At any time when action by one or more classes or series
of stockholders of the Corporation is permitted to be taken by written
consent pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation, the provisions of this section shall apply. All consents
properly delivered in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the
DGCL shall be deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the
Corporation as required by the DGCL, written consents signed by the
holders of a sufficient number of shares to take such corporate action are so
delivered to the Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been
taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the
record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were
delivered to the Corporation as provided in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Any action taken pursuant to such written consent or consents of the
stockholders shall have the same force and effect as if taken by the
stockholders at a meeting thereof. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board.
If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by the DGCL,
shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth
the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by
delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by
the DGCL, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

  



  

Section 10. The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days
before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting ( _provided, however_ , if the
record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than
ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the
stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date),
arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder
and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such
list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any
purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior
to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided
that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the
principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information
is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting
shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the
list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the
whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and
the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice
of the meeting.

Section 11. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the
stockholders, may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes, who may
be employees or agents of the Corporation or stockholders or their proxies,
but who shall not be directors of the Corporation or candidates for election
as directors. In the event that the Board fails to so appoint one or more
inspectors of stockholder votes or, in the event that one or more inspectors
of stockholder votes previously designated by the Board fails to appear or act
at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint one
or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill such vacancy or
vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at any meeting of
the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall
take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of inspector of
stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the best of their
ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. The inspector or
inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting
power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the
Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of
the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the
meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such
certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors
may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.

  



  

Section 12.

  



  

(A) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_.

  



  

(1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the
proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at
an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) as provided in the Investor Rights
Agreement (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), (b) pursuant to
the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) delivered
pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws, (c) by or at the direction
of the Board or any authorized committee thereof or (d) by any stockholder of
the Corporation who is entitled to vote on such election or such other
business at the meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set
forth in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph (A) of this Section
12 and who was a stockholder of record at the time such notice was delivered
to the Secretary of the Corporation.

  



  

(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to Article I, Section
12(A)(1)(d) of these By-laws, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation (even if such matter
is already the subject of any notice to the stockholders or a public
announcement from the Board), and, in the case of business other than
nominations of persons for election to the Board, such other business must be
a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the date of the
annual meeting is scheduled for more than thirty (30) days before, or more
than seventy (70) days following, such anniversary date, or if no annual
meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be
timely must be so delivered not later than the tenth day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. For
purposes of the application of Rule 14a-4(c) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") (or any successor provision), the
date for notice specified in this paragraph (A)(2) shall be the earlier of
the date calculated as hereinbefore provided or the date specified in
paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 14a-4. For purposes of the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the adoption of these By-Laws, the date of the
preceding year's annual meeting shall be deemed to be [●]1 of the preceding
calendar year.

Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a
director all information relating to such person that is required to be
disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is
otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including such person's
written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and
to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the
stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the
business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or
business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration
and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these By-
Laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting
such business at the meeting and any substantial interest (within the meaning
of Item 5 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act) in such business of such
stockholder and the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner,
if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and
address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books and
records, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class or series and number of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such
beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of
record of the stock of the Corporation at the time of the giving of the
notice, will be entitled to vote at such meeting and will appear in person or
by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (iv) a
representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, will
be or is part of a group which will (A) deliver a proxy statement and/or form
of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the voting power of the
Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the
proposal or elect the nominee and/or (B) otherwise solicit proxies or votes
from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, (v) a
certification regarding whether such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any,
have complied with all applicable federal, state and other legal requirements
in connection with the stockholder's and/or beneficial owner's acquisition of
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Corporation and/or the
stockholder's and/or beneficial owner's acts or omissions as a stockholder of
the Corporation and (vi) any other information relating to such stockholder
and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies
for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an
election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (d) a
description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the
nomination or proposal and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of
stock of the Corporation between or among the stockholder giving the notice,
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made, any of their respective affiliates or associates and/or any others
acting in concert with any of the foregoing (collectively, " _proponent
persons_ "); and (e) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including without limitation any contract to purchase or sell,
acquisition or grant of any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell,
swap or other instrument) the intent or effect of which may be (i)
to transfer to or from any proponent person, in whole or in part, any of the
economic consequences of ownership of any security of the Corporation, (ii)
to increase or decrease the voting power of any proponent person with respect
to shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation and/or (iii) to
provide any proponent person, directly or indirectly, with the opportunity to
profit or share in any profit derived from, or to otherwise benefit
economically from, any increase or decrease in the value of any security of
the Corporation. A stockholder providing notice of a proposed nomination for
election to the Board or other business proposed to be brought before a
meeting (whether given pursuant to this paragraph (A)(2) or paragraph (B)
of this Section 12) shall update and supplement such notice from time to time
to the extent necessary so that the information provided or required to be
provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and as of the
date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, provided that if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
information shall be supplemented and updated as of such later date. Any such
update and supplement shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) days
after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of
the meeting (in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as of
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting), not later than ten (10) days prior to the date for the meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update or
supplement required to be made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof) and not later than five (5) days
after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, but no later than the date prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update and supplement
required to be made as of a date less than fifteen (15) days prior the date of
the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). The Corporation may
require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as a director of the Corporation and to determine the independence of
such director under the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder and
applicable stock exchange rules.

The foregoing notice requirements of this paragraph (A)(2) of Section 12
shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than
nominations) if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such
stockholder's intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in
compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Exchange Act, and
such stockholder has complied with the requirements of such Rule for
inclusion of such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the
Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. Nothing in this
paragraph (A)(2), Section 12 shall be deemed to affect any rights of
stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy
statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph
(A)(2) of this Section 12 to the contrary, in the event that the number of
directors to be elected to the Board is increased, effective after the time
period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of
this Section 12, and there is no public announcement naming all of the
nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board made by
the Corporation at least one hundred (100) days prior to the
first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's
notice required by this Section 12 shall also be considered timely, but only
with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it
shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day
following the day on which a public announcement of such increase is first
made by the Corporation.

  



  

(B) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall
be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting
pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of these By-Laws. Nominations of persons for
election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of
meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof or (b)
provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such
meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote on
such election at the meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set
forth in this Section 12 and who is a stockholder of record at the time such
notice is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. In the event the
Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to
vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the
case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the
Corporation's notice of meeting if the stockholder's notice as required by
paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 12 is delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting
or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made
of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board
to be elected at such meeting.

  



  

(C) _General_. (1) Only persons who are nominated in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 shall be eligible
to be elected to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted
at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12\. Except as
otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws,
the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether
a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 and, if
any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 12,
to declare that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such
proposed business shall not be transacted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to
present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For
purposes of this Section 12, to be considered a qualified representative of
the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or
partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by
such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder
to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such
person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

(2) If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject
to such rules, regulations and procedures as the Board may adopt,
stockholders of the Corporation and proxyholders not physically present at a
meeting of stockholders of the Corporation may, by means of
remote communication participate in a meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation and be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation whether such meeting is to be held at a
designated place or solely by means of remote communication;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting
by means of remote communication is a stockholder of the Corporation or
proxyholder; (ii) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders of the Corporation and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
the stockholders of the Corporation, including an opportunity to read or hear
the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such
proceedings; and (iii)  if any stockholder of the Corporation or proxyholder
votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote
communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by
the Corporation.

  



  

(3) For purposes of this Section 12, " _public announcement_ "
shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News
Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service, in a document
publicly filed or furnished by the Corporation with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
or otherwise disseminated in a manner constituting " _public disclosure_ "
under Regulation FD promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  



  

(4) No adjournment or postponement or notice of adjournment or
postponement of any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice (or
extend any notice time period) of such meeting for purposes of this Section
12, and in order for any notification required to be delivered by a
stockholder pursuant to this Section 12 to be timely, such notification must
be delivered within the periods set forth above with respect to the
originally scheduled meeting.

  



  

(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 12; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any references in these By-Laws to the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not
intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or
proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section
12 (including paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) hereof), and compliance with
paragraphs (A)(1)(d) and (B) of this Section 12 shall be the exclusive means
for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business. Nothing in
this Section 12 shall apply to the right, if any, of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for as long as the
Investor Rights Agreement remains in effect with respect to the
Stockholder Parties (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), the
Stockholder Parties (to the extent then subject to the Investor
Rights Agreement) shall not be subject to the notice procedures set forth in
paragraphs (A)(2), (A)(3) or (B) of this Section 12 with respect to any
annual or special meeting of stockholders to the extent necessary to effect
the transactions and rights set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement.

Article II. 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  

  



  

Section 1. The Board shall consist, subject to the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Investor Rights Agreement, of such number of
directors as shall from time to time be fixed exclusively by resolution
adopted by the Board. Directors shall (except as hereinafter provided for the
filling of vacancies and newly created directorships and except as otherwise
expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation) be elected by the
holders of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of such directors in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Investor Rights Agreement, as applicable. A majority of
the total number of directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business. Except as otherwise provided by law, these By-
Laws or the Certificate of Incorporation, the act of a majority of the
directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act
of the Board. Directors need not be stockholders.

  



  

Section 2. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor
Rights Agreement, unless otherwise required by the DGCL or Article
II, Section 4 of these By-Laws, any newly created directorship on the Board
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation, removal, retirement,
disqualification or otherwise) shall be filled only by a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum, by any authorized
committee of the Board or by a sole remaining director.

  



  

Section 3. Meetings of the Board shall be held at such place, if any,
within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed
by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of any
meeting. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such times as may
from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may
be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief
Executive Officer, or by a majority of the total number of directors then in
office, by written notice, including facsimile, e-mail or other means of
electronic transmission, duly served on or sent and delivered to each
director in accordance with Article X, Section 2\. Notice of each special
meeting of the Board shall be given, as provided in Article X, Section 2, to
each director (i) at least twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting if such
notice is oral notice given personally or by telephone or written notice
given by hand delivery or by means of a form of electronic transmission and
delivery; (ii) at least two (2) days before the meeting if such notice is
sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service; and (iii) at
least five (5) days before the meeting if such notice is sent through the
United States mail. If the Secretary shall fail or refuse to give such
notice, then the notice may be given by the officer who called the meeting or
the directors who requested the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not
specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held
without notice immediately after the annual meeting of stockholders at the
same place, if any, at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given
of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the
Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall
attend such meeting (except when the director attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting,
in writing (including by electronic transmission).

  



  

Section 4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any
one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the
right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or
more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and other features of
such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Certificate of
Incorporation (including any certificate of designation relating to any series
of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto. The number of directors that may be
elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be
in addition to the total number of directors fixed by the Board pursuant to
the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in the terms of such series, the number of directors that
may be so elected by the holders of any such series of stock shall be elected
for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and vacancies
among directors so elected by the separate vote of the holders of any such
series of Preferred Stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors elected by such series, or, if there are
no such remaining directors, by the holders of such series in the same manner
in which such series initially elected a director.

Section 5. The Board may from time to time establish one or more
committees of the Board to serve at the pleasure of the Board, which shall
be comprised of such members of the Board, subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement, and have such duties as the Board shall from time to time
determine. Any director may belong to any number of committees of the Board.
Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor Rights
Agreement, the Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members
of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any
meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of
a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not
disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a
quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the
meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member, subject to
the Investor Rights Agreement. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, these By-Laws or the resolution of the Board designating the
committee, a committee may create one or more subcommittees,
each subcommittee to consist of one or more members of the committee, and may
delegate to a subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the
committee.

  



  

  

Section 6. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken
at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without
a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing (including by electronic transmission), and the
writing or writings (including any electronic transmission or transmissions)
are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board.

  



  

Section 7. The members of the Board or any committee thereof may
participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case may be, by
means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute
presence in person at such a meeting.

  



  

Section 8. The Board may establish policies for the compensation of
directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of directors, in
each case, in connection with services provided by directors to the
Corporation.

  



  

Article III. 
 OFFICERS

  



  

Section 1. The Board shall elect officers of the Corporation, including
a Chief Executive Officer, a President and a Secretary. The Board may also
from time to time elect such other officers as it may deem proper or may
delegate to any elected officer of the Corporation the power to appoint and
remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of
office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated
Executive, Senior or Corporate, or may be given such other designation or
combination of designations as the Board or the Chief Executive Officer may
determine. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person. The Board
may also elect or appoint a Chairman of the Board, who may or may not also be
an officer of the Corporation. The Board may elect or appoint co-Chairmen of
the Board, co-Presidents or co-Chief Executive Officers and, in such case,
references in these By-Laws to the Chairman of the Board, the President or
the Chief Executive Officer shall refer to either such co-Chairman of the
Board, co-President or co-Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be.

  



  

Section 2. All officers of the Corporation elected by the Board shall
hold office for such terms as may be determined by the Board or, except with
respect to his or her own office, the Chief Executive Officer, or until their
respective successors are chosen and qualified or until his or her earlier
resignation or removal. Any officer may be removed from office at any time
either with or without cause by the Board, or, in the case of appointed
officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have
been conferred by the Board.

  



  

Section 3. Each of the officers of the Corporation elected by the Board
or appointed by an officer in accordance with these By-Laws shall have the
powers and duties prescribed by law, by these By-Laws or by the Board and, in
the case of appointed officers, the powers and duties prescribed by the
appointing officer, and, unless otherwise prescribed by these By-Laws or by
the Board or such appointing officer, shall have such further powers and
duties as ordinarily pertain to that office.

  



  

Section 4. Unless otherwise provided in these By-Laws, in the absence or
disability of any officer of the Corporation, the Board or the Chief
Executive Officer may, during such period, delegate such officer's powers and
duties to any other officer or to any director and the person to whom such
powers and duties are delegated shall, for the time being, hold such office.

Article IV. 
 INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

  



  

Section 1. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative or any other type whatsoever (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
an officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an " _indemnitee_ "), whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director, officer, employee, agent or trustee or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest
extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments,
fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith;
except as provided in Section 3 of this Article IV with respect to proceedings
to enforce rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses or with
respect to any compulsory counterclaim brought by such indemnitee, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 2. In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in
Section 1 of this Article IV, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be
paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred in
appearing at, participating in or defending any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition or in connection with a proceeding brought to establish
or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Article IV (which shall be governed by Section 3 of this Article IV)
(hereinafter an " _advancement of expenses_ "); _provided, however_ , that, if
(x) the DGCL requires or (y) in the case of an advance made in a proceeding
brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement, an
advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made solely upon delivery to the Corporation
of an undertaking (hereinafter an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined after final judicial decision from which there is no further right
to appeal (hereinafter a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is
not entitled to indemnification under this Article IV or otherwise.

  



  

Section 3. If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this Article IV is not
paid in full by the Corporation within (i) sixty (60) days after a written
claim for indemnification has been received by the Corporation or (ii) twenty
(20) days after a claim for an advancement of expenses has been received by
the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or to
obtain advancement of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, if the indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in any
such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.
In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense of the
Corporation that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the
Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final
adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for
indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee
of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have
made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that
indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the
indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL,
nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including by its directors
who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the
indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of
such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit
brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an
advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden
of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such
advancement of expenses, under this Article IV or otherwise shall be on the
Corporation.

Section 4.

  



  

(A) The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of
expenses and costs to any indemnitee under this Article IV, or
the entitlement of any indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of
expenses and costs under this Article IV, shall not limit or restrict in any
way the power of the Corporation to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to
such indemnitee in any other way permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of,
or invalidate, any right to which any indemnitee seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses and costs may be entitled under any law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in such indemnitee's capacity as an officer, director, employee or
agent of the Corporation and as to action in any other capacity.

  



  

(B) Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined
below) may arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director
and/or officer of the Corporation or as a director, officer, employee, agent
or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise at the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as
defined below), the Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for
the payment to the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of
expenses in connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this Article IV, irrespective of any
right of recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related
entities. Under no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any
right of subrogation against or contribution by the indemnitee-related
entities and no right of advancement, indemnification or recovery the
indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or
otherwise alter the rights of the indemnitee or the obligations of the
Corporation under this Article IV. In the event that any of the indemnitee-
related entities shall make any payment to the indemnitee in respect of
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to any jointly
indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity making such payment shall
be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery
of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the indemnitee shall
execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all things that may be
reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such
documents as may be necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee-
related entities shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to this
Section 4(B) of Article IV, entitled to enforce this Section 4(B) of Article
IV.

  



  

For purposes of this Section 4(B) of Article IV, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

  



  

(1) The term " _indemnitee-related entities_ " means any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any
other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has
agreed, on behalf of the Corporation or at the Corporation's request, to
serve as a director, officer, employee or agent and which service is covered
by the indemnity described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or
in part, the Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement
obligation.

  



  

(2) The term " _jointly indemnifiable claims_ " shall be broadly
construed and shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or
proceeding for which the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or
advancement of expenses from both the indemnitee-related entities and the
Corporation pursuant to applicable law, any agreement, certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement,
certificate of formation, certificate of limited partnership or comparable
organizational documents of the Corporation or the indemnitee-related
entities, as applicable.

  



  

Section 5. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this Article IV
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article IV that adversely affects any
right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall
not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

Section 6. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of
expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of
the provisions of this Article IV with respect to the indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other

shares in uncertificated form if the owner: (i) requests such a new
certificate before the Corporation has notice that the certificate
representing such shares has been acquired by a protected purchaser; (ii) if
requested by the Corporation, delivers to the Corporation a bond sufficient to
indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the

shares; and (iii) satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the
Corporation.

  



  

(B) If a certificate representing shares has been lost, apparently
destroyed or wrongfully taken, and the owner fails to notify the
Corporation of that fact within a reasonable time after the owner has notice
of such loss, apparent destruction or wrongful taking and the Corporation
registers a transfer of such shares before receiving notification, the owner
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be precluded from asserting
against the Corporation any claim for registering such transfer or a claim to
a new certificate representing such shares or such shares in uncertificated
form.

thereof, such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing, or from an
individual presenting proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority
to transfer the shares of stock; or, in the case of stock represented by

number of shares or accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power.

  



  

(B) The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any
agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock

Section 5. _Registered Stockholders_. Before due presentment for
registration of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the

uncertificated shares, the Corporation may treat the registered owner as the
person exclusively entitled to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger
and the other books and records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive
dividends or notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise
all the rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person
who is the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a

beneficial ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as
are provided under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records
of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 6. _Regulations_. The Board shall have power and authority to
make such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable
requirement of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with
respect to the issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock

Article X. 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  



  

Section 1. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of
any meeting need not be given to any person who shall attend such meeting
(except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive
notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing (including by
electronic transmission).

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Section 2. Means of Giving Notice. Except as otherwise set forth in any
applicable law or any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-Laws, notice of any meeting shall be given by the following means:

  



  

(A) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws notice is required to be
given to any director, such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and
sent by mail, or by a nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means
of facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or
(iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director
will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage
and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when
deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the
director at the director's address appearing on the records of the
Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the
facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of
the Corporation, (v) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the
electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission,
when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director
appearing on the records of the Corporation.

  



  

(B) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means
any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission
of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed
by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by
such a recipient through an automated process.

  



  

(C) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting
the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by
the Corporation to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the
Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these By-Laws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to
stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that
address to whom such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such
stockholder's consent by delivering written notice of such revocation to the
Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the
Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the
Corporation of its intention to send such a single written notice shall be
deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(D) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_.

  



  

(1) Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not
be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority
or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any
action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to any such
person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and
effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action
taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such
is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons
entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is
unlawful.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

(2) Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation,
under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these By-Laws, to any stockholder to whom (x) notice of two consecutive
annual meetings of stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of
the taking of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to
such stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual
meetings, or (y) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail)
of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown
on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the
giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action
or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder
shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.
If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written
notice setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement
that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to
be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(x) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 3. Section headings in these By-Laws are for convenience of
reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect in limiting or
otherwise construing any provision herein.

  



  

Section 4. In the event that any provision of these By-Laws is or
becomes inconsistent with any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL, the provision of these By-laws shall not be given
any effect to the extent of such inconsistency but shall otherwise be given
full force and effect.

having voting rights generally, and shall have the exclusive right to vote
for the election of directors and all other matters properly submitted to a
vote of the stockholders.

any corporation or property of the Corporation, the holders of Class A Common
Stock (including Class A Common Stock which converted to Class A Common Stock

to the record date for such dividend or other distribution) and Class B
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive ratably, taken together as a
single class, in proportion to the number of shares held by each such
stockholder such dividends and other distributions as may from time to time
be declared by the Board in its discretion out of the assets of the
Corporation that are by law available therefor at such times and in such
amounts as the Board in its discretion shall determine. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, the
payment of any dividend or other distribution so declared with respect to the
Class B Common Stock shall be contingent upon, and no dividend or other
distribution shall be paid unless and until, the occurrence of a Conversion
Event (as defined below), if any, in respect of any such share of Class B
Common Stock and, upon declaration of any dividend or other distribution, the
record date for such dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares
of Class B Common Stock (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the Class A
Common Stock) shall be one day before the Conversion Date with respect to
such shares of Class B Common Stock, and the Board shall so set the record

entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by each such
stockholder. The holders of shares of (i) Class B Common Stock (other than to
the extent such liquidation, dissolution or winding up constitutes a
Conversion Event, in which case such Class B Common Stock shall automatically

the holders of such resulting Class A Common Stock shall be treated as a
holder of Class A Common Stock in accordance with this Section 4.3(C)) and

(D) _Conversion of Class B Common Stock_. Immediately upon a B-1
Conversion Event (as defined below) with respect to a share of Series
B-1 Common Stock, each such share of Series B-1 Common Stock then outstanding
shall automatically, without any further action on the part of the record
holder thereof or any other person (including the Corporation), convert into
and become an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, which
conversion shall be effective on the Conversion Date with respect to a
corresponding Series 1 RCU (each, as defined in the LLC Agreement) (such
date, the " _Series B-1 Conversion Date_") with respect to such shares of
Series B-1 Common Stock, and the holder of each such share of Series B-1
Common Stock shall become a record holder of Class A Common Stock as of such
Series B-1 Conversion Date. Immediately upon a B-2 Conversion Event (as
defined below) with respect to a share of Series B-2 Common Stock, each such
share of Series B-2 Common Stock then outstanding shall automatically,
without any further action on the part of the record holder thereof or any
other person (including the Corporation), convert into and become an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock, which conversion shall be effective
on the Conversion Date with respect to a corresponding Series 2 RCU (each, as
defined in the LLC Agreement) (such date, the " _Series B-2 Conversion
Date_") with respect to such shares of Series B-2 Common Stock, and the
holder of each such share of Series B-2 Common Stock shall become a record
holder of Class A Common Stock as of such Series B-2 Conversion Date. Each
outstanding stock certificate or book-entry credit, as applicable, that,
immediately prior to a Conversion Event, represented one or more shares of
Class B Common Stock shall, upon such Conversion Event, be automatically
deemed to represent as of the Conversion Date an equal number of shares of
Class A Common Stock, without the need for any surrender, exchange or
registration thereof or any consent or notification, and on or promptly after
the Conversion Date, if such shares are uncertificated, the Corporation or
the transfer agent of the Corporation shall register such shares in book-
entry form, reflecting that such holder is a record holder of Class A Common
Stock as of the Conversion Date in respect of the relevant shares of Class B
Common Stock, without the need for any surrender, exchange or registration
thereof or any consent or notification. The Corporation, or any transfer
agent of the Corporation, shall, upon the request on or after the
Conversion Date of any holder whose shares of Class B Common Stock have been
converted into shares of Class A Common Stock as a result of a Conversion
Event and upon surrender by such holder to the Corporation of the outstanding
certificate(s) formerly representing such holder's shares of Class B Common
Stock (if any), issue and deliver to such holder certificate(s)
representing the shares of Class A Common Stock into which such holder's
shares of Class B Common Stock were converted as a result of such Conversion
Event (if such shares are certificated). Upon the occurrence of a Conversion
Event with respect to a share of Class B Common Stock, the Dividend Catch-Up
Payment (as defined below) in respect of such share of Class B Common Stock
shall become payable as of the Conversion Date with respect to such share of
Series B Common Stock by the Corporation to the holder of record of such
share of Class B Common Stock as of the day immediately prior to such
Conversion Date, and shall be paid in accordance with this _Section 4.3(D)_.
The Corporation shall pay, no later than five (5) Business Days (as defined
in the LLC Agreement) following the Conversion Date with respect to a share of
Class B Common Stock for which a Conversion Event has occurred, the dividends
previously declared in respect of such share of Class B Common
Stock beginning at the time of the Closing and ending on the day before the
Conversion Date with respect to such Class B Common Stock (" _Dividend Catch-
Up Period_ "), but not including dividends declared on the Conversion Date
(which amount, excluding any amounts declared on the Conversion Date, shall
be, for the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate per share amount of dividends
declared in respect of a share of Class A Common Stock during the Dividend
Catch-Up Period (each such payment, a " _Dividend Catch-Up Payment_ ")). If
any portion of a Dividend Catch-Up Payment was declared by the Corporation as
an in-kind dividend (which, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
Certificate of Incorporation, shall not include any transaction subject to
_Section 4.3(G)_ hereof), then such portion of the Dividend Catch-Up Payment
shall also be paid as an in-kind dividend; provided, however, to the extent
the Corporation received cash in lieu of the in-kind distributions in respect
of its Common Units held in the Company which were declared substantially
concurrently with such in-kind dividend by the Corporation comprising a
portion of the Dividend Catch-Up Payment, then such equivalent portion of the
Dividend Catch-Up Payment shall be paid in cash in lieu of such in-kind
dividend and such holder of Class B Common Stock shall be treated for all
purposes as if it received the in-kind distribution of property, which is
then immediately exchanged by such holder for cash of equivalent value. If a
dividend is declared by the Corporation on a Conversion Date, such dividend
shall be paid to the holder of each share of Class B Common Stock converting
on such Conversion Date as a holder of Class A Common Stock, and not as part
of the Dividend Catch-Up Payment, and the Corporation shall ensure that the
holder of the applicable shares of Class B Common Stock on such Conversion
Date shall be treated as a record holder of Class A Common Stock (in respect
of each share of Class B Common Stock which converted into a share of Class A
Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 4.3(D)_ on such Conversion
Date) for purposes of such dividend. For purposes of this Certificate of
Incorporation, (i) "B-1 Conversion Event" means (a) the occurrence of a VWAP
1 Vesting Event (as such term is defined in the LLC Agreement, (b)
the occurrence of (i) a Continuing Member COC (as such term is defined in the
LLC Agreement), with respect to any Series B-1 Common Stock held by any
Person other than the Sponsor (or its Affiliates) or those certain independent
directors of PubCo as of immediately prior to the date hereof who hold shares
of Series B-1 Common Stock, or (ii) a Sponsor COC (as such term is defined in
the LLC Agreement), with respect to any Series B-1 Common Stock held by the
Sponsor (or its Affiliates) or those certain independent directors of the
Corporation as of immediately prior to the date hereof who hold shares of
Series B-1 Common Stock, or (c) a Liquidating Event (as such term is defined
in the LLC Agreement) pursuant to which each share of Class A Common Stock
would be entitled to at least $13.50 per share (taking into account the
conversion of each share of Series B-1 Common Stock to a share of Class A
Common Stock); _provided_ , _however_ , that the reference to $13.50 shall
be decreased by the aggregate per share amount of dividends actually paid in
respect of a share of Class A Common Stock between the date hereof and the
date of such Liquidating Event., (ii) a " _B-2 Conversion Event_ " means a
Series 2 Vesting Event (as such term is defined in the LLC Agreement) and

(E) _Cancellation of Class V Common Stock; Cancellation of Class
B Common Stock_. In the event that any outstanding share of Class V Common
Stock shall cease to be held directly or indirectly by a holder of a Common
Unit (as defined in the LLC Agreement), as set forth in the books and records
of the Company (including pursuant to an Exchange (as defined in the LLC
Agreement)), such share shall automatically and without further action on the
part of the Corporation or any holder of Class V Common Stock be transferred
to the Corporation and cancelled for no consideration. The Corporation shall
not issue additional shares of Class V Common Stock after the Closing Date
other than in connection with the valid issuance of Common Units in accordance
with the LLC Agreement or the vesting of any Restricted Common Units (as
defined in the LLC Agreement) into Common Units upon the occurrence of an
applicable Vesting Event (as defined in the LLC Agreement). To the extent
that, on or before the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing Date, a
Conversion Event has not occurred with respect to any share of Class B Common
Stock, then immediately and without any further action by the Corporation or
the holder thereof, on the date that is the tenth (10th) anniversary of
the Closing Date, all such shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding shall
automatically be forfeited to the Corporation and canceled for no
consideration therefor and shall cease to be outstanding and any dividend
declared in respect of such shares of Class B Common Stock and any Dividend
Catch-Up Payment shall also be forfeited to the Corporation for no
consideration therefor; provided, that, with respect to any share of Class B
Common Stock which was issued pursuant to the Business Combination
Agreement as consideration for a Company Option (as such term is defined in
the Business Combination Agreement), any reference in this sentence to "the
tenth (10th) anniversary" shall be deemed to refer to the "fifth (5th)
anniversary".

  



  

(F) _Reservation of Stock_. The Corporation shall at all times
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class
A Common Stock an amount equal to the number of then-outstanding Common Units
subject to Exchange (as defined in the LLC Agreement) and then-outstanding
Restricted Common Units plus the number of then-outstanding shares of Class B
Common Stock, in each case, from time to time. The Corporation shall at all
times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of
Class V Common Stock an amount equal to the number of then-outstanding
Restricted Common Units, from time to time.

  



  

   

6

 

    



  

(G) _Splits_. If the Corporation at any time combines or subdivides
(by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization,
merger, amendment of this Certificate of Incorporation, scheme, arrangement
or otherwise (each, a " _Split_ ")) any class of Common Stock into a greater
or lesser number of shares, the shares of each other class of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately
similarly combined or subdivided such that the ratio of shares of
outstanding Class B Common Stock and Class V Common Stock, respectively, to
shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such
subdivision shall be maintained immediately after such combination or
subdivision; _provided_ , that such actions with respect to the Class V
Common Stock shall be subject to Section 4.1(d) and the last sentence of
Section 3.2 of the LLC Agreement. Any adjustment described in this Section
4.3(G) shall become effective at the close of business on the date the
combination or subdivision becomes effective. In the event of any Split of
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock occurs prior to the
B-1 Conversion Date, the per share amount used to calculate the amount of
the Dividend Catch-Up Payment owed in respect of the shares of Series B-1
Common Stock with respect to any dividend declared prior to such Split shall
be ratably adjusted in a manner consistent with such Split such that, in the
aggregate, the holders of Series B-1 Common Stock would not receive a greater
or lesser Dividend Catch-Up Payment than such holders would have
received absent such Split. In the event of any Split of shares of Class A
Common Stock or Class B Common Stock occurs prior to the B-2 Conversion Date,
the per share amount used to calculate the amount of the Dividend Catch-Up
Payment owed in respect of the shares of Series B-2 Common Stock with respect
to any dividend declared prior to such Split shall be ratably adjusted in a
manner consistent with such Split such that, in the aggregate, the holders of
Series B-2 Common Stock would not receive a greater or lesser Dividend Catch-
Up Payment than such holders would have received absent such Split.

  



  

(H) _Transfers of Class B Common Stock_. No share of Class B
Common Stock may be Transferred (as such term is defined in the
LLC Agreement), other than to the holder of such share of Class B Common
Stock's Permitted Transferees (as such term is defined in the LLCA), prior to
the Conversion Date of such shares of Class B Common Stock, at which time the
shares of Class A Common Stock into which such shares of Class B Common Stock
convert in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation may be Transferred, subject to any restrictions on transfer
applicable to the holder of such Class A Common Stock and applicable law.

  



  

Article V

  



  

Section 5.1. _By-Laws_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
powers conferred by the DGCL, the Board is expressly authorized to make,
amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation (as the
same may be amended from time to time, the " _By-Laws_ ") without the assent
or vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of
the State of Delaware or this Certificate of Incorporation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Incorporation or any
provision of law which might otherwise permit a lesser vote of the
stockholders, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation required herein (including any
certificate of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock), by
the By-Laws or pursuant to applicable law, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding
shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order
for the stockholders of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind,
in whole or in part, any provision of Article I, Article II or Article IV of
the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any provision inconsistent
therewith and, with respect to any other provision of the By-Laws of the
Corporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders
of the Corporation to alter, amend, repeal or rescind, in whole or in part,
any such provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation, or to adopt any
provision inconsistent therewith.

Article VI

  



  

Section 6.1. _Board of Directors_.

  



  

(A) Except as otherwise provided in this Certificate of
Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the Corporation shall
be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Subject to the investor
rights agreement (the "Investor Rights Agreement") dated on or about the date
hereof, by and among (i) the Corporation; (ii) the IVP Blocked Equityholders
(as defined therein); (iii) the Elliott Equityholders (as defined therein);
(iv) the Sponsor; (v) Insight E2open Aggregator, LLC and (vi) the other
parties thereto, the total number of directors constituting the whole Board
shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board.
Subject to the Investor Rights Agreement, the directors (other than those
directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a series or together with one or more other such series, as the
case may be) shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II
and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third
of the total number of such directors. Class I directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of
stockholders following the Closing Date, Class II directors shall initially
serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders
following the Closing Date and Class III directors shall initially serve for
a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the
Closing Date. At each annual meeting following the Closing Date, successors
to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be
elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders. If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or
decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number
of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such
additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship
resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that
shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a
decrease in the number of directors remove, or shorten the term of, any
incumbent director. Any such director shall hold office until the annual
meeting at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall
be elected and qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board is
authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to their
respective class in accordance with the Investor Rights Agreement.

  



  

(B) Subject to the rights granted to the holders of any one or more
series of Preferred Stock then outstanding and the rights granted pursuant to
the Investor Rights Agreement, any newly-created directorship on the Board
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal or other cause) shall be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by the stockholders). Any
director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

  



  

   

8

 

    



  

(C) Any director may resign at any time upon notice to the
Corporation given in writing or by any electronic transmission permitted
by the By-Laws. Subject to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, any or
all of the directors (other than the directors elected by the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a series or
together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) may be
removed only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Investor Rights Agreement, in case the Board or any one or
more directors should be so removed, new directors may be elected pursuant to
Section 6.1(B).

  



  

(D) Whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred
Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a
series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect
directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term
of office, removal and other features of such directorships shall be governed
by the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate
of designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto.
Notwithstanding Section 6.1(A), the number of directors that may be elected
by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be in addition to
the number fixed pursuant to Section 6.1(A) hereof, and the total number of
directors constituting the whole Board shall be automatically adjusted
accordingly.

  



  

(E) Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written
ballot unless the By-Laws shall so provide.

  



  

Article VII

  



  

Section 7.1. _Meetings of Stockholders_. Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the holders of stock of the Corporation must be
effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may
not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders unless such action
is recommended or approved by all directors of the Corporation then in office;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any action required or permitted to be taken by
the holders of Class V Common Stock, voting separately as a class, or, to the
extent expressly permitted by the certificate of designations relating to one
or more series of Preferred Stock, by the holders of such series of Preferred
Stock, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more
other such series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares of the relevant
class or series having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal
place of business, or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.
Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special
meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by or at
the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive
Officer of the Corporation or as otherwise provided in the By-Laws.

Article VIII

  



  

Section 8.1. _Limited Liability of Directors_. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, no director of the Corporation will have any
personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages
for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL,
as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this Article VIII
shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any limitation on the
personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing prior to such
amendment or repeal.

  



  

Section 8.2. _Director and Officer Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_. The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall
indemnify and advance expenses to any Person made or threatened to be made a
party to any action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director or officer of the Corporation or any predecessor of the
Corporation, or, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation,
serves or served at any other enterprise as a director or officer at the
request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.3. _Employee and Agent Indemnification and Advancement of
Expenses_. The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, may
indemnify and advance expenses to any Person made or threatened to be made a
party to an action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or any predecessor of the
Corporation, or serves or served at any other enterprise as an employee or
agent at the request of the Corporation or any predecessor to the
Corporation.

voting stock of the Corporation owned by such group immediately prior to the
business combination or the transaction which resulted in the

is an interested stockholder, the voting stock of the Corporation deemed to
be outstanding shall include stock deemed to be owned by the person through
application of the definition of "owner" below but shall not include any

pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person or any of such
person's Affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is accepted for
purchase or exchange; or (ii) the right to vote such stock pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding; _provided_ ,  _however,_ that a
person shall not be deemed the owner of any stock because of such person's
right to vote such stock if the agreement, arrangement or understanding to
vote such stock arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given in
response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to 10 or more persons; or

(12) " _voting stock_ " means stock of any class or series entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors and, with respect to any entity

Article X

  



  

Section 10.1. _Competition and Corporate Opportunities_.

  



  

(A) In recognition and anticipation that members of the Board who
are not employees of the Corporation (" _Non-Employee Directors_ ") and their
respective Affiliates and Affiliated Entities (each, as defined below) may now
engage and may continue to engage in the same or similar activities or
related lines of business as those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage and/or other business activities that overlap with or
compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or indirectly,
may engage, the provisions of this Article X are set forth to regulate and
define the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with respect to
certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they may involve
any of the Non-Employee Directors or their respective Affiliates and the
powers, rights, duties and liabilities of the Corporation and its directors,
officers and stockholders in connection therewith.

  



  

(B) No Non-Employee Director or his or her Affiliates or Affiliated
Entities (the Persons (as defined below) above being referred
to, collectively, as " _Identified Persons_ " and, individually, as an "
_Identified Person_ ") shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, have any duty to refrain from directly or indirectly (1) engaging in
the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which the
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, has historically engaged, now engages
or proposes to engage at any time or (2) otherwise competing with the
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, no Identified Person shall be liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for breach of any
fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that such Identified
Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy
in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business
opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for an Identified Person and
the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, except as provided in Section
10.1(C) of this Article X. Subject to Section 10.1(C) of this Article X, in
the event that any Identified Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity
for itself, herself or himself and the Corporation or any of its Affiliates,
such Identified Person shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or
other business opportunity to the Corporation or any of its Affiliates and,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall not be liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders or to any Affiliate of the Corporation for
breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder, director or officer of the
Corporation solely by reason of the fact that such Identified Person pursues
or acquires such corporate opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or
offers or directs such corporate opportunity to another Person.

  



  

   

14

 

    



  

(C) Subject to Section 10.1(D), the Corporation does not renounce
its interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any Non-
Employee Director if such opportunity is expressly offered or presented to
such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Corporation, and the provisions of Section 10.1(B) of this Article X shall not
apply to any such corporate opportunity.

  



  

(D) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Article X, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor contractually
permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the
Corporation's business or is of no practical advantage to the Corporation,

Article XI

  



  

Section 11.1. _Severability_. If any provision of this Certificate of
Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied
to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation (including, without
limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Certificate of

Article XII

  



  

Section 12.1. _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to
the selection of an alternative forum, (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director,
officer, other employee, agent or stockholder of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, or any claim for aiding and
abetting such alleged breach, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee, agent
or stockholder of the Corporation (a) arising pursuant to any provision of
the DGCL, this Certificate of Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated)
or the By-Laws or (b) as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the
Delaware Court of Chancery or (iv) any action asserting a claim against
the Corporation or any current or former director, officer, other employee,
agent or stockholder of the Corporation governed by the internal affairs
doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, as to any action in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, be solely and exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of
Chancery;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any
claim (a) as to which the Delaware Court of Chancery determines that there is
an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such
determination), (b) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court
or forum other than the Delaware Court of Chancery, or (c) arising
under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, as to which the federal district courts of the United States of
America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole
and exclusive forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Article XII will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty
created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole
and exclusive forum. If any action the subject matter of which is within the
scope of the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located
within the State of Delaware (a " _foreign action_ ") in the name of any
stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the
personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the
State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to
enforce the forum provisions (an " _enforcement action_ "); and (y) having
service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action
by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the foreign action as agent for
such stockholder. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the
Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or
holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be
deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Article XII.
