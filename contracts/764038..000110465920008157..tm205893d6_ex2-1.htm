such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled

Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and (B) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares or dividends or distributions
payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of South
State Common Stock which the shares of CenterState Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this

proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of South State, threatened, that would reasonably be expected to lead
to the revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension or restriction of any such registrations, permits, licenses,

of South State or CenterState, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
law to make or continue to make the South State Board Recommendation or the CenterState Board Recommendation, as applicable, such
Board of Directors may, in the case of South State, prior to the receipt of the Requisite South State Vote, and in the case of
CenterState, prior to the receipt of the Requisite CenterState Vote, submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation
(although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event such
Board of Directors may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint Proxy Statement

not take any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least three (3) business days&rsquo; prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination
to take such action (including, in the event such action is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material terms
and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof,
or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of such notice period, takes into account
any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely
than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the South State Board Recommendation
or CenterState Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be
a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section
6.3. Neither South State nor CenterState shall adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case
may be, except that South State or CenterState (1) shall be permitted to adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting or the CenterState
Meeting, as the case may be, to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the South State Board or the CenterState Board, as the case may be, has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed
by such party&rsquo;s shareholders prior to the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case may be and (2) shall
adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of South State Common Stock or CenterState Common Stock, as the case may
be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting CenterState or South State, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite CenterState Vote or the Requisite South State Vote; <U>provided</U> that, without the
prior written consent of the other party, neither South State nor CenterState shall adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting
or the CenterState Meeting, as the case may be, under this clause (2) for more than five (5) business days in the case of any individual
adjournment or postponement or more than twenty (20) business days in the aggregate. If the CenterState Meeting or the South State
Meeting is adjourned or postponed, South State and CenterState will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the South State

date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
(x) the South State Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of South State at the South

at the CenterState Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve either South State or CenterState of such obligation.</P>
