WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of South State, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, has resolved to recommend that South State's shareholders approve

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger

hereby, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article I 
  
 The Merger

  



  

1.1   _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the South Carolina Business Corporation Act of
1988, as amended (the " _SCBCA_ ") and the Florida Business Corporation Act,
as amended (the " _FBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, CenterState shall merge
with and into South State (the " _Merger_ "), with South State surviving the
Merger (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "
_Surviving Entity_ "). The Surviving Entity shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of South Carolina. Upon consummation of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of CenterState shall terminate.

  



  

   

-1- 

 



    



  

1.2   _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place by
electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date
which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by CenterState and South State. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to as the  " _Closing Date_."

  



  

1.3   _Effective Time_. On or (if agreed by CenterState and
South State) prior to the Closing Date, South State and CenterState,
respectively, shall cause to be filed articles of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of South Carolina (the " _South Carolina Secretary_ ")
and articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida
(the " _Florida Secretary_ ") (collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ ").
The Merger shall become effective at such time as specified in the Articles of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the SCBCA and the FBCA,
or at such other time as shall be provided by applicable law (such time
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

1.4   _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the SCBCA and the FBCA.

  



  

1.5   _Conversion of CenterState Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of South
State, CenterState or the holder of any securities of South State or
CenterState:

  



  

(a)  Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of CenterState issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the " _CenterState Common Stock_ "), except for
shares of CenterState Common Stock owned by CenterState or South State (in
each case other than shares of CenterState Common Stock (i) held in trust
accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties or
(ii) held, directly or indirectly, by CenterState or South State in respect of
debts previously contracted), shall be converted into the right to receive
0.3001 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ " and such shares the "
_Merger Consideration_ ") of the common stock, par value $2.50 per share, of
South State (the " _South State Common Stock_ ").

  



  

(b)  All of the shares of CenterState Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an "
_Old Certificate_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to "
_Old Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of CenterState Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of CenterState Common Stock
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) a New Certificate
representing the number of whole shares of South State Common Stock which
such shares of CenterState Common Stock have been converted into the right to
receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of
CenterState Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section
2.2(e), without any interest thereon and (iii) any dividends or distributions
which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2, in
each case, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of South State Common Stock or CenterState Common Stock
shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock
split or reverse stock split, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or
distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio to give South State and the holders of CenterState Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; _provided_ that nothing contained in this sentence shall be
construed to permit CenterState or South State to take any action with respect
to its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

-2- 

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
at the Effective Time, all shares of CenterState Common Stock that are owned
by CenterState or South State (in each case other than shares of CenterState
Common Stock (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and
the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity that are
beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by
CenterState or South State in respect of debts previously contracted) shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no South State Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

1.6   _South State Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of South State Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Surviving Entity and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

1.7   _Treatment of CenterState Equity Awards; Warrants_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
CenterState Common Stock (a " _CenterState Stock Option_ ") that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any required
action on the part of CenterState or any holder of such CenterState Stock
Option, be vested and converted into a vested option (a " _South State Stock
Option_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of South State Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the
total number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to such
CenterState Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
(B) the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of South State
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of
(A) the exercise price per share of CenterState Common Stock of such
CenterState Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(B) the Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7,
each such South State Stock Option shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the corresponding CenterState Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that each South State Stock
Option shall remain exercisable through the remainder of its term.

  



  

   

-3- 

 



    



  

(b)  At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase shares of
CenterState Common Stock (a " _CenterState Warrant_ ") that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any required action on the part of CenterState or any
holder of such CenterState Warrant, be converted into a warrant (a " _South
State Warrant_ ") to purchase (i) that number of shares of South State Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the
total number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to such CenterState
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share of South State Common
Stock (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of CenterState Common Stock of such CenterState
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio. Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7, each such South
State Warrant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding CenterState Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that each South State Warrant shall remain exercisable through the
remainder of its term. Where the context so requires, all references to
CenterState (or an affiliate or a predecessor of CenterState) in the assumed
agreements representing the CenterState Warrants shall be deemed to
be references to the Surviving Entity (or its Subsidiaries, as applicable),
and all references to the Board of Directors of CenterState (or an affiliate
or a predecessor of CenterState) shall be deemed to be references to the Board
of Directors of the Surviving Entity.

  



  

(c)  At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of
CenterState Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction (a " _CenterState Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any required action on the part of CenterState or any holder of such
CenterState Restricted Stock Award, be converted into a restricted stock
award (a " _South State Restricted Stock Award_ ") in respect of that number
of shares of South State Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of CenterState Common
Stock subject to the CenterState Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 1.7, each such South State Restricted Stock Award
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding CenterState Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  At the Effective Time, each time-vesting restricted stock
unit award in respect of a share of CenterState Common Stock (a  "
_CenterState RSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any required action
on the part of CenterState or any holder of such CenterState RSU Award, be
converted into a time-vesting restricted stock unit award (a " _South State
RSU Award,_ " and together with the converted South State Stock Options and
South State Restricted Stock Awards, the " _South State Converted Equity
Awards_ ") in respect of that number of shares of South State Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to the CenterState
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly provided in this Section 1.7, each such
South State RSU Award shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
applied to the corresponding CenterState RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(e)  At the Effective Time, each performance-vesting restricted
stock unit award in respect of a share of CenterState Common Stock (a "
_CenterState PSU Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any required action
on the part of CenterState or any holder of such CenterState PSU Award, be
converted into a South State RSU Award in respect of that number of shares of
South State Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject
to the CenterState PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. For purposes of this Section 1.7(e),
the number of shares of CenterState Common Stock subject to a CenterState PSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be determined
assuming performance goals are satisfied based on the greater of target and
actual performance as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the
Effective Time, each such South State RSU Award shall be subject only to time-
vesting through the remainder of the originally scheduled performance period
(or any later scheduled vesting date). Except as expressly provided in this
Section 1.7, each such South State RSU Award shall be subject to the same
terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding CenterState PSU Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7 or in the applicable plan and award agreements governing the CenterState
Equity Awards, (i) in the event that the employment of a holder of a South
State Converted Equity Award is terminated by the Surviving Entity without
"cause" or for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the
applicable award agreement evidencing the South State Converted Equity Award
(which is generally expected to be consistent with the definitions in the
corresponding CenterState Equity Award (if any))) prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, then such South State Converted Equity Award
shall become fully vested, and (ii) notwithstanding any acceleration of
vesting that occurs as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or this Section 1.7, the settlement of any South State RSU Award
that has been converted from a CenterState RSU Award or a CenterState PSU
Award shall occur in a manner that complies with Section 409A of the Code and
in a manner consistent with the timing set forth in the plan and award
agreement applicable to the corresponding CenterState Equity Award.

  



  

(g)  At or prior to the Effective Time, CenterState, the Board
of Directors of CenterState and its compensation committee, as applicable,
shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7.

  



  

(h)  As of the Effective Time, the number and kind of shares
available for issuance under each equity incentive plan of CenterState shall
be adjusted to reflect South State Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable plan.

  



  

(i)  South State shall take all corporate actions that are
necessary for the assumption of the CenterState Equity Awards pursuant to
Sections 1.7(a) through 1.7(e), including the reservation, issuance and
listing of South State Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.7. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, South State shall file with the SEC a post-effective
amendment to the Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares of South
State Common Stock underlying such CenterState Equity Awards, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such assumed CenterState Equity Awards remain
outstanding.

1.8   _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Entity_. At the
Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of South State, as amended as
set forth in _Exhibit A_ (such amendment, the " _South State Articles
Amendment_ "), shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

1.9   _Bylaws of Surviving Entity_. At the Effective Time, the
bylaws of South State, as amended as set forth in _Exhibit B_ (such amendment,
the " _South State Bylaws Amendment_ "), shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

1.10   _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of
reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

  



  

1.11   _Bank Merger_.

  



  

(a)  Immediately following the Merger, South State Bank, a South
Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary of South State ("
_South State Subsidiary Bank_ "), will merge with and into CenterState Bank,
N.A., a national banking association and wholly owned Subsidiary of
CenterState (" _CenterState Subsidiary Bank_ ") (the " _Bank Merger_
"). CenterState Subsidiary Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank
Merger (the " _Surviving Bank_ ") and, following the Bank Merger, the
separate corporate existence of South State Subsidiary Bank shall cease and
CenterState Subsidiary Bank shall be renamed "South State Bank, N.A."
effective as of the Effective Time. Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, South State Subsidiary Bank and CenterState Subsidiary Bank will
enter into an agreement and plan of merger in the form set forth in _Exhibit
C_ (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). Each of South State and CenterState
shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement and the Bank Merger as the sole
shareholder of South State Subsidiary Bank and CenterState Subsidiary Bank,
respectively, and South State and CenterState shall, and shall cause South
State Subsidiary Bank and CenterState Subsidiary Bank, respectively, to,
execute certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and
certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank
Merger Certificates_ ") immediately following the Effective Time. The Bank
Merger shall become effective at such time and date as specified in the Bank
Merger Agreement in accordance with applicable law, or at such other time as
shall be provided by applicable law.

  



  

(b)  It is intended that the Bank Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
the Bank Merger Agreement is intended to be and will be adopted as a plan of
reorganization for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

Article II 
  
 Exchange of Shares

  



  

2.1   _South State to Make Consideration Available_. At or prior
to the Effective Time, South State shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company mutually agreed upon by South State
and CenterState (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for exchange in accordance with
this Article II for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates,
certificates or, at South State's option, evidence in book-entry form,
representing shares of South State Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 1.5 (collectively, referred to herein as  " _New Certificates_ "),
and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section
2.2(e) (such cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of South State Common Stock payable in
accordance with Section 2.2(b), being referred to herein as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

  



  

2.2   _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a)  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than five (5) days thereafter, the Surviving Entity shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old
Certificates representing shares of CenterState Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive South State Common Stock pursuant to Article I, a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in
exchange for New Certificates representing the number of whole shares of
South State Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of CenterState Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.2(b) (such materials and instructions to include
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with
respect to book-entry shares). Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or
Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent (it being
understood that no certificates shall be required to be delivered for shares
of CenterState Common Stock held in book-entry at the Effective Time),
together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, (i) a New Certificate representing that number
of whole shares of South State Common Stock to which such holder of
CenterState Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions
of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II and (B) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and
the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or dividends or distributions payable to holders of Old
Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of whole shares of
South State Common Stock which the shares of CenterState Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends
or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

  



  

   

-7- 

 



    



  

(b)  No dividends or other distributions declared with respect
to South State Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Old Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Old Certificate
in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate
in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to
the whole shares of South State Common Stock that the shares of CenterState
Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive.

  



  

(c)  If any New Certificate representing shares of South State
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are
registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old
Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of South
State Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of CenterState of the shares of CenterState Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old Certificates representing such shares
are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for New Certificates representing shares of South State Common
Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this Article
II.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of South State
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to South State Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of South State. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, the Surviving Entity shall pay to each former
holder of CenterState Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of South
State Common Stock on NASDAQ as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for
the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days ending on the day
preceding the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of CenterState Common Stock held by such holder immediately
prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) of South State Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties
acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

  



  

   

-8- 

 



    



  

(f)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the shareholders of CenterState for twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the Surviving Entity. Any former holders of CenterState
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the shares of
South State Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the South State Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each former share of CenterState Common Stock such
holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of South State,
CenterState, the Surviving Entity, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of CenterState Common Stock for
any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by former holders of shares of CenterState Common Stock immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g)  The Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of South State Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of CenterState
Common Stock or CenterState Equity Awards, such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment or
distribution under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
CenterState Common Stock or CenterState Equity Awards in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

(h)  In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the
shares of South State Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares,
as applicable, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Article III 
  
 Representations And Warranties Of CenterState

  



  

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by CenterState
to South State concurrently herewith (the " _CenterState Disclosure Schedule_
"); _provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an
exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in
the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii)
the mere inclusion of an item in the CenterState Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by
CenterState that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a
section of this Article III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section
of this Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other
sections of this Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its
face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other
sections or (b) as disclosed in any CenterState Reports filed by CenterState
since December 31, 2017, and prior to the date hereof (but disregarding risk
factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures
of risks set forth in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any
other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature), CenterState hereby represents and warrants to
South State as follows:

  



  

3.1   _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a)  CenterState is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Florida, and is
a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended (the " _BHC Act_ ") and has elected to be treated as a
financial holding company under the BHC Act. CenterState has the corporate
power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. CenterState is
duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or operated
by it makes such licensing, qualification or standing necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good standing would
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. As used in this Agreement, the
term  " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to South State,
CenterState or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, any effect, change,
event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that, either
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such party and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ that, with respect to this
clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact
of (A) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable regulatory accounting requirements,
(B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general
applicability to companies in the industries in which such party and its
Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or
in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as
changes in interest rates) conditions affecting the financial services
industry generally and not specifically relating to such party or its
Subsidiaries, (D) public disclosure of the transactions contemplated hereby
or actions expressly required by this Agreement or that are taken with the
prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (E) a decline in the trading price of a party's
common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet earnings projections
or internal financial forecasts, but not, in either case, including any
underlying causes thereof; except, with respect to subclause (A), (B), or (C),
to the extent that the effects of such change are materially
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities,
results of operations or financial condition of such party and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry
in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such
party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in
this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any
person, means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, bank
or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or person of
which (x) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls at least
a majority of the securities or other interests having by their terms
ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or others
performing similar functions or (y) such first person is or directly or
indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing
member or others performing similar functions. True and complete copies of
the articles of incorporation of CenterState (the " _CenterState Articles_
") and the bylaws of CenterState (the " _CenterState Bylaws_ "), in each case
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made
available by CenterState to South State.

(b)  Except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on CenterState, each Subsidiary of CenterState (a " _CenterState Subsidiary_
") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or
foreign) where its ownership, leasing or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires it to be so licensed or qualified or in good
standing and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of CenterState or any
Subsidiary of CenterState to pay dividends or distributions except, in the
case of CenterState or a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for
restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all
similarly regulated entities. The deposit accounts of CenterState Subsidiary
Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ")
through the Deposit Insurance Fund (as defined in Section 3(y) of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act of 1950) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all
premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are
pending or threatened. Section 3.1(b) of the CenterState Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of CenterState as of
the date hereof. No Subsidiary of CenterState is in violation of any of the
provisions of the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of such Subsidiary of CenterState. There
is no person whose results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders'
equity or financial position are consolidated in the financial statements of
CenterState other than the CenterState Subsidiaries.

commitments, understandings or arrangements by which CenterState may become
bound to issue additional shares of its capital stock or other equity or
voting securities of or ownership interests in CenterState, or that otherwise
obligate CenterState to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire, any of the foregoing (collectively, " _CenterState Securities_
"). Other than CenterState Equity Awards, no equity or equity-based awards
(including any cash awards where the amount of payment is determined, in
whole or in part, based on the price of any capital stock of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries) are outstanding. No CenterState Subsidiary owns any
capital stock of CenterState. There are no voting trusts, shareholder
agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect to which CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or transfer
of CenterState Common Stock, capital stock or other voting or equity
securities or ownership interests of CenterState or granting any shareholder
or other person any registration rights.

  



  

(b)  Except as would not, either individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on CenterState, CenterState owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the CenterState Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, claims,
title defects, mortgages, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security

3.3   _Authority; No Violation_.

  



  

(a)  CenterState has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly and
validly approved by the Board of Directors of CenterState. The Board of
Directors of CenterState has determined that the Merger, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests
of CenterState and its shareholders, has adopted and approved this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and has
directed that this Agreement be submitted to CenterState's shareholders for
approval at a meeting of such shareholders and has adopted a resolution to
the foregoing effect. Except for the approval of this Agreement by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on this
Agreement by the holders of CenterState Common Stock at a meeting called
therefor (the " _Requisite CenterState Vote_ ") and subject to the adoption
and approval of the Bank Merger Agreement by CenterState as CenterState
Subsidiary Bank's sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the
part of CenterState are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by CenterState and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by South State) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of CenterState, enforceable against CenterState in accordance with
its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws of general
applicability affecting the rights of creditors generally and the
availability of equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ")).

  



  

(b)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
CenterState nor the consummation by CenterState of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Bank Merger),
nor compliance by CenterState with any of the terms or provisions hereof,
will (i) violate any provision of the CenterState Articles or the CenterState
Bylaws or the articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or similar

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState,
neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected
or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of CenterState included
in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2019 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since

process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of CenterState or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. CenterState (x)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to
CenterState, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of CenterState by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-
Oxley Act_ "), and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation
prior to the date hereof, to CenterState's outside auditors and the audit
committee of CenterState's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect CenterState's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in CenterState's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management
to CenterState's auditors and audit committee. CenterState has no reason to
believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,

or a plan that has two (2) or more contributing sponsors at least two (2) of
whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA
(a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and none of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries nor any CenterState ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability

CenterState Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid
on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and
records of CenterState.

their duties to the CenterState Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the CenterState Benefit Plans that would reasonably be

4.1   _Corporate Organization_.

  



  

(a)  South State is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of South Carolina,

has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its

conducted. South State is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned, leased or operated by it makes such licensing, qualification or
standing necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or
to be in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on South State. True
and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of South State (the "
_South State Articles_ ") and the bylaws of South State (the " _South State
Bylaws_ "), in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by South State to CenterState.

duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where

independent public accountants of South State as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with South State on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(b)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either

nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected
or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of South State included

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on South State. South State (x)

defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to South State, including its Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of South

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in South State's internal controls over financial
reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to South
State's auditors and audit committee. South State has no reason to believe

officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required

applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as

objections and authorizations (and the expiration or termination of all
statutory waiting periods in respect thereof) (i) from the Federal Reserve
Board, the SCBFI and the OCC, (ii) under the HSR Act and (iii) set forth in
Section 3.4 or Section 4.4 that are necessary to consummate the transactions

other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose

obtained, or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.

of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives of the
other party, access, during normal business hours during the period prior to

federal or state banking laws (other than reports or documents that South
State or CenterState, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law), and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Neither South
State nor CenterState nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or

CenterState's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information
(after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense or similar agreement between the parties) or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of

confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the confidentiality agreement, dated October 1, 2019, between South State
and CenterState (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(c)  No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other set forth
herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other
party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective

6.3   _Shareholder Approvals_. Each of South State and
CenterState shall call, give notice of, establish a record date for, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _South State Meeting_ " and the
" _CenterState Meeting_ ," respectively) to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose
of obtaining (a) in the case of CenterState, the Requisite CenterState Vote,
and in the case of South State, the Requisite South State Vote, and (b) if so
desired and mutually agreed, a vote upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders in connection with the
approval of a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and
each of CenterState and South State shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the
same date. Each of South State and CenterState and their respective Boards of
Directors shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the
shareholders of South State and CenterState, as applicable, the Requisite
South State Vote and the Requisite CenterState Vote, as applicable, including
by communicating to the respective shareholders of South State and
CenterState its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement) that, in the case of South State, the shareholders of South
State adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and approve the South State Articles Amendment (the "
_South State Board Recommendation_ "), and, in the case of CenterState, the
shareholders of CenterState adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _CenterState Board Recommendation_
"). Each of South State and CenterState and their respective Boards
of Directors shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to the other party the South State Board Recommendation, in the case
of South State, or the CenterState Board Recommendation, in the case of
CenterState, (ii) fail to make the South State Board Recommendation, in the
case of South State, or the CenterState Board Recommendation, in the case of
CenterState, in the Joint Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or
endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt,
approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly
and without qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or
(B) reaffirm the South State Board Recommendation, in the case of South
State, or the CenterState Board Recommendation, in the case of CenterState,
in each case within ten (10) business days (or such fewer number of days as
remains prior to the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as
applicable) after an Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by
the other party to do so, or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing
(any of the foregoing a " _Recommendation Change_ "). However, subject to
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of South State or
CenterState, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good
faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law to make or continue to make the South
State Board Recommendation or the CenterState Board Recommendation, as
applicable, such Board of Directors may, in the case of South State, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite South State Vote, and in the case
of CenterState, prior to the receipt of the Requisite CenterState Vote,
submit this Agreement to its shareholders without recommendation (although
the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be
rescinded or amended), in which event such Board of Directors may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Joint
Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; _provided_ that such Board of Directors may not take
any actions under this sentence unless it (A) gives the other party at least
three (3) business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such
action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise
to its determination to take such action (including, in the event such action
is taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest material
terms and conditions and the identity of the third party in any such
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe
in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (B) at the end of
such notice period, takes into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by the other party and, after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to make or continue to make the South State Board
Recommendation or CenterState Board Recommendation, as the case may be. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new
notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3. Neither South State nor
CenterState shall adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting or the
CenterState Meeting, as the case may be, except that South State or
CenterState (1) shall be permitted to adjourn or postpone the South State
Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case may be, to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the South State Board or the CenterState Board, as the case
may be, has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by such party's shareholders prior
to the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case may be and
(2) shall adjourn or postpone the South State Meeting or the CenterState
Meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting is
originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of South State Common Stock
or CenterState Common Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting CenterState or South
State, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite CenterState Vote or the
Requisite South State Vote; _provided_ that, without the prior written
consent of the other party, neither South State nor CenterState shall adjourn
or postpone the South State Meeting or the CenterState Meeting, as the case
may be, under this clause (2) for more than five (5) business days in the case
of any individual adjournment or postponement or more than twenty (20)
business days in the aggregate. If the CenterState Meeting or the South
State Meeting is adjourned or postponed, South State and CenterState will use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the South State Meeting or the
CenterState Meeting, as the case may be, to also be adjourned or postponed
such that the meetings occur on the same date. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms, (x) the South State Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of South State at the
South State Meeting and (y) the CenterState Meeting shall be convened and
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of CenterState at the
CenterState Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve
either South State or CenterState of such obligation.

6.4   _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to
Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of South State and CenterState shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any
other third party that is required to be obtained by CenterState or
South State or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.5   _Stock Exchange Listing_. South State shall cause the
shares of South State Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

6.6   _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a)  From the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending
on December 31, 2020 (the " _Transition Period_ "), unless otherwise mutually
determined, the CenterState Benefit Plans and South State Benefit Plans in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (other than such benefit plans as may
be mutually agreed) shall remain in effect with respect to employees of
CenterState and South State (and their respective Subsidiaries),
respectively, covered by such plans at the Effective Time who continue to be
employed by the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ "). During the Transition Period, the Surviving
Entity shall, subject to applicable law and the terms of such plans, review,
evaluate and analyze the South State Benefit Plans and CenterState Benefit
Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new benefit plans with
respect to the Continuing Employees (collectively, the " _New Benefit Plans_
"), which shall be effective beginning as of January 1, 2021. CenterState and
South State shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, develop New
Benefit Plans (including amending existing plans) which, among other things,
(i) treat similarly situated employees on a substantially equivalent basis,
taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, geographic
location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, and (ii) do not discriminate
between employees who were covered by South State Benefit Plans, on the one
hand, and those covered by CenterState Benefit Plans on the other hand, at
the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) from and after
January 1, 2021, unless otherwise mutually determined by CenterState and
South State, the Surviving Entity shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
provide employees of CenterState who are Continuing Employees with employee
compensation and benefits under the New Benefit Plans on terms and conditions
that are substantially the same as those that apply to similarly situated
South State employees who are Continuing Employees and (ii) South State and
CenterState agree that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, any Continuing Employees who
experience a qualifying termination of employment during such one (1)-year
period will be eligible for severance in accordance with Section 6.6(a) of the
CenterState Disclosure Schedule and the South State Disclosure Schedule,
respectively.

  



  

   

-61- 

 



    



  

(b)  With respect to any New Benefit Plans in which any
Continuing Employees first become eligible to participate on or after January
1, 2021, and in which such employees did not participate prior to January 1,
2021, the Surviving Entity shall: (i) waive all preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under
any New Benefit Plans in which such employees first become eligible to
participate after January 1, 2021, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous South State Benefit Plan or CenterState Benefit Plan, as the case
may be, (ii) provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the end of the
Transition Period (or, if later, prior to the time such employee commenced
participation in the New Benefit Plan) under a South State Benefit Plan or
CenterState Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under
the analogous CenterState or South State Benefit Plan) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Benefit
Plans in which such employee first become eligible to participate after
January 1, 2021, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with
CenterState and South State, and their respective Subsidiaries, for all
purposes in any New Benefit Plan in which such employees first become eligible
to participate after January 1, 2021 to the same extent that such service was
taken into account under the analogous CenterState or South State Benefit
Plan prior to the end of the Transition Period; _provided_ that the foregoing
service recognition shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in
duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (B) for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, (C) for purposes of
any benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (D) to any
benefit plan that is a frozen plan, either with respect to level of benefits
or participation, or provides grandfathered benefits.

  



  

(c)  The occurrence of the Effective Time shall constitute a
"change in control," "change of control" or similar phrase for purposes of
the South State Benefit Plans. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, each South State Equity Award that is
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall vest in full at
the Effective Time and shall remain exercisable through the remainder of its
term, with any applicable performance goals deemed satisfied based on the
greater of target and actual performance as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In respect of each South State Equity Award that is granted
following the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding as of the
Effective Time, in the event that the employment of a holder of such
South State Equity Award is terminated by the Surviving Entity without
"cause" or for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the applicable
award agreement evidencing the South State Equity Award) prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, then such South State Equity Award shall
become fully vested and exercisable (as applicable). In respect of
each CenterState Equity Award that is granted following the date of this
Agreement and that remains outstanding as of the Effective Time, in the event
that the employment of a holder of such CenterState Equity Award is terminated
by the Surviving Entity without  "cause" or for "good reason" (as such terms
are defined in the applicable award agreement evidencing the CenterState
Equity Award) prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, then such
CenterState Equity Award shall become fully vested and exercisable (as
applicable).

  



  

(d)  Prior to Closing, CenterState and South State shall
cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the CenterState 401(k) Plan
(the " _CenterState 401(k) Plan_ ") and the South State 401(k) Plan (the "
_South State 401(k) Plan_ ") and make a mutual determination as to which of
the CenterState 401(k) Plan and the South State 401(k) Plan will continue to
be maintained by the Surviving Entity following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuing 401(k) Plan_ ") and which one will be terminated prior to
Effective Time (such plan, the " _Terminated 401(k) Plan_ "). The Board of
Directors (or an appropriate committee thereof) of CenterState or South
State, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action
as is necessary or appropriate to terminate the Terminated 401(k) Plan,
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time. CenterState or South State, as applicable,
shall provide the other party with evidence that the Terminated 401(k) Plan
has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
reasonable review and comment by the other party) not later than two (2) days
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii) the Continuing Employees who
participated in the Terminated 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time shall
be eligible to participate, effective as of the Effective Time, in the
Continuing 401(k) Plan. South State and CenterState shall take any and all
actions as may be required, including amendments to the CenterState 401(k)
Plan and/or the South State 401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees to
make rollover contributions from the Terminated 401(k) Plan to the Continuing
401(k) Plan of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash, notes (in the case of
loans), South State Common Stock or a combination thereof in an amount equal
to the full account balance distributed to such employee from the
Terminated 401(k) Plan.

(e)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee,
officer, director or consultant of South State or CenterState or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Surviving Entity, CenterState, South State or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the
Surviving Entity, CenterState, South State or any Subsidiary or affiliate
thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of South State or CenterState or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend, or modify any CenterState Benefit Plan, South State Benefit Plan, New
Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Entity or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular CenterState Benefit Plan, South State Benefit Plan, New Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of
Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee,
officer, director or consultant of South State or CenterState or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

6.7   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_. 

  



  

(a)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity
shall indemnify and hold harmless and shall advance expenses as incurred, in
each case to the extent (subject to applicable law) such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by CenterState pursuant to the
CenterState Articles, the CenterState Bylaws, the governing or organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of CenterState and any indemnification agreements
in existence as of the date hereof and disclosed in Section 6.7(a) of the
CenterState Disclosure Schedule, each present and former director or officer
of CenterState and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) (collectively, the " _CenterState Indemnified Parties_ ") against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether
arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such
person is or was a director or officer of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , that in the case of advancement of expenses, any
CenterState Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
CenterState Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

   

-63- 

 



    



  

(b)  For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by CenterState (
_provided_ , that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies with
a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that the Surviving Entity shall
not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300%
of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by CenterState for
such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Entity
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving
Entity's good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, South
State or CenterState, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of
South State, may (and at the request of South State, CenterState shall use
its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six
(6)-year "tail" policy under CenterState's existing directors' and officers'
insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  



  

(c)  The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each CenterState Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any
other person or engages in any similar transaction, then in each such case,
the Surviving Entity will cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity will expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

  



  

6.8   _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of
South State, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of CenterState, on the other
hand) or to vest the Surviving Entity with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to
the Merger or the Bank Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party
to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by South State.

  



  

6.9   _Advice of Changes_. South State and CenterState shall
each promptly advise the other party of any effect, change, event,
circumstance, condition, occurrence or development (i) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would
reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, obligations, covenants or agreements contained
herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the
aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that
any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to
any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9
or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be
satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party
failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would
independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2
or 7.3 to be satisfied; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or
noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

   

-64- 

 



    



  

6.10   _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of South
State and CenterState shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of South State Common Stock and CenterState Common Stock
and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that holders of CenterState Common Stock
shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in
any quarter with respect to their shares of CenterState Common Stock and any
shares of South State Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

  



  

6.11   _Shareholder Litigation_. Each party shall give the other
party prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against such party or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall give the other party the opportunity to participate (at
such other's party's expense) in the defense or settlement of any such
litigation. Each party shall give the other the right to review and comment
on all filings or responses to be made by such party in connection with any
such litigation, and will in good faith take such comments into account. No
party shall agree to settle any such litigation without the other party's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , that the other party shall not be
obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include a full release
of such other party and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief after the Effective Time upon the Surviving Entity or
any of its affiliates.

  



  

6.12   _Corporate Governance; Headquarters; Name_.

6.13   _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

(a)  Each party agrees that it will not, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any
person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, have or participate in any discussions with
any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any
term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with
this Section 6.13) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the receipt of the Requisite South State Vote, in the
case or South State, or the Requisite CenterState Vote, in the case of
CenterState, a party receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this
Section 6.13(a), such party may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and
its Subsidiaries' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such
negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition
Proposal if the Board of Directors of such party concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to
financial matters, its financial advisors) that failure to take such actions
would be more likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that, prior to furnishing any
confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
this sentence, such party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal on terms no less favorable
to it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality
agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate
with such party. Each party will, and will cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person
other than CenterState or South State, as applicable, with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Each party will promptly (within twenty-four (24)
hours) advise the other party following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the terms and conditions of
and the identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal),
will provide the other party with an unredacted copy of any such Acquisition
Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other materials received in

or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated assets of the party, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share

that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by the parties.

necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may

Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as

therewith, (i) South State and CenterState shall cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts to execute and deliver any supplemental indentures and (ii)

actions required to be taken, by the Trust Preferred Indentures in connection
with the redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, and (iii) concurrently
with the consummation of the redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, if
no Trust Preferred Securities remain outstanding under any Trust Preferred
Indentures, take all actions required to be taken by such Trust Preferred

CenterState Common Stock into shares of South State Common Stock in the
Merger and the conversion of CenterState Equity Awards into

Board of Directors of South State and of CenterState, or a committee of non-
employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter, and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
required to cause (in the case of CenterState) any dispositions of
CenterState Common Stock or CenterState Equity Awards by the CenterState
Insiders, and (in the case of South State) any acquisitions of South State
Common Stock or South State Equity Awards by any CenterState Insiders who,
immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Entity subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by

termination.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but
without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages to
the extent permitted herein, in no event shall either party be required to pay
the Termination Fee more than once.

  



  

(e)  Each of South State and CenterState acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if South State or CenterState, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against
the non-paying party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such
non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other
party (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit.
In addition, if South State or CenterState, as the case may be, fails to pay
the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2, then such party shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts at a rate per annum equal to the "prime
rate" published in the _Wall Street Journal_ on the date on which such
payment was required to be made for the period commencing as of the date that
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date
that such overdue amount is actually paid in full.

obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby

security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  



  

9.13   _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or
