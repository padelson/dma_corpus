#### 

  

### (c) If the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock is registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company, it shall be a condition of delivery that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery shall have paid all
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

  

### 

  

### (d) If any holder of shares of Company Common Stock is unable to
surrender such holders Certificates because such Certificates have been
lost, mutilated or destroyed, such holder may deliver in lieu thereof an
affidavit in form and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to
the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (e) The Exchange Agent on behalf of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement in respect of shares of Company Common Stock such
amount as it reasonably determines is required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended through the date hereof (the " _Code_ "). To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. The
Exchange Agent shall

  



        
   

  



  

### promptly pay any amounts so withheld to the Internal Revenue Service
or applicable state taxing authorities.

  

### 

  

### (f) In the event of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may
be), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, occurring
(or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted
to reflect fully such event.

  

### 

  

### (g) No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or cancellation of Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote
or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder and all Uncertificated
Shares that have been cancelled pursuant to Section 2.06(a)) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the weighted
average of the per share closing prices of Parent Common Stock on The New
York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") Composite Transactions Reporting System
during the ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days prior to the
Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (h) At any time following the sixth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Exchange Agent
and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including all
interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them or cancellation of Uncertificated Shares held by
them pursuant to Section 2.06(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Government
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and public
policy, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (i) All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever
a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the
Parent Common Stock, the record date

  



        
   

  



  

### for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. In the case of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by Certificate(s) only, no dividends or other distributions
in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.08(d)) is surrendered for exchange
in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.08(d) or notice of guaranteed delivery
as described above), or in the case of Uncertificated Shares,
the cancellation of such shares in accordance with Section 2.06(a),
there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender or cancellation, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

### 

  

### (j) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

  

### 

  

### (k) It is intended that, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, the
Exchange Agent shall issue at or promptly following the Effective Time the
consideration set forth in Section 2.08(b)(ii) with respect to such shares
without action by the holders thereof. The parties hereto shall make
appropriate adjustments to this Section 2.08 to the extent reasonably
necessary to effect such issuance.

the Leased Properties (" _Lease Documents_ ") have been made available to
Parent. Each of the Lease Documents is valid, binding and in full force and
effect as against the Company or the applicable Subsidiary and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, as against the other party thereto and none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default of any such Lease
Document, except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company. All material payments required to have been made
under the Lease Documents by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been
made. Except in accordance with the terms of the relevant Lease Document,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has exercised any option or
right to terminate, renew or extend or otherwise affect the rights or
obligations of the tenant under any Leased Properties, and no consent of any
party is necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries and affiliates to legally

date of each such Company Title Insurance Policy, the Companys or the
applicable Subsidiarys (whether directly or as a successor-in-interest) fee
simple or leasehold title to the Company Properties, subject only to
Permitted Encumbrances, and to the Companys Knowledge, such policies
are, at the date hereof, valid and in full force and effect and no written
claim has been made against any such policy. To the Companys Knowledge, no
Company Title Insurance Policy contains what is commonly referred to as a
standard survey exception (i.e. any state of facts which an accurate survey
would show). A correct and complete copy of each Company Title Insurance
Policy has been previously made available to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (d) Section 3.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth each

maintenance, operation or use of any buildings or other improvements on any
of the Company Properties or by the continued maintenance, operation or use
of the parking areas located thereon or appurtenant thereto or used in
connection therewith, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, which would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

  



     

      
  

  

###

Company.

lease is for more than 100,000 square feet and is for a duration of six
months or more (individually, " _Company Lease_ " and collectively, "
_Company Leases_ "). Each Company Lease is in full force and effect and is
valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms against (a) the
Company or a Subsidiary of the Company and (b) to the Knowledge of the
Company, the other parties thereto, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company. Except as listed in Section 3.12(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, or as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with
respect to the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all
obligations required to be performed by it to date under each of the Company
Leases and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under any Company Lease, which default, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company (and to the Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred which, with
due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default). The
Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of each
Company Lease and all material amendments or material modifications thereto.
Section 3.12(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes any Company Lease
which has been executed for which the term has not yet commenced. With

its Subsidiaries has granted any unexpired option agreements or rights of
first refusal with respect to the purchase of a Company Property or any
portion thereof

each of its Subsidiaries operated thereon to be operated in the Ordinary

aggregate, would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. The major
structural elements of the improvements comprising the Company Property,
including, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilation, air conditioning or
plumbing systems, elevators or parking elements, are in sufficiently good
condition (except for ordinary wear and tear) to allow the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to be operated in the Ordinary Course, except as

Property is located in a special flood hazard area designated by any
Governmental Authority. Each Company Property has sufficient parking that
complies with all applicable Law (including variances and legal non-
conforming approvals) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company. Each of the Company Properties is an independent property that does
not rely on any facilities (other than public facilities, public roads and
off-site parking) located in any real property which is not a Company
Property to fulfill any requirement of any Governmental Authority or for the
furnishing to such Company Property of any essential building system or
utility, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

Company and its Subsidiaries own, license or otherwise possess legally
enforceable rights to use all Intellectual Property used in the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to

individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the

misappropriating any of the Intellectual Property owned or used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for infringements, violations or
misappropriations which would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company. To the Companys Knowledge, the Company has not infringed or
otherwise violated the Intellectual Property of any third party during the
five (5) year period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement.

  

###

any other taxing authority any agreement, waiver or other document or
arrangement extending or having the effect of extending the period for
assessment or collection of Taxes (including, but not limited to,

to any Tax matter is currently in force and to the Knowledge of the Company,

indirect interest therein, owned any assets that would cause the Company to

Disclosure Schedule with respect to any section or subsection of this Article
IV shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection
of this Article IV to the extent such relationship is reasonably inferable,
_provided_ that nothing in the Parent Disclosure Schedule is intended to
broaden the scope of any representation or warranty of Parent or Purchaser
made herein), or as disclosed in Parent SEC Reports filed with, or furnished

their respective directors, officers and representatives not to, (i) solicit,
initiate, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
non-public information) any inquiries with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) initiate, participate in or knowingly encourage any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,

the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal or a proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal that was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement or that did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 6.04, the Company may furnish, or cause to be
furnished, non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person who made such proposal and may participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such proposal if (A) each of the
Company Board and the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such action
is necessary in order for such directors to comply with the directors
statutory duties under Section 2-405.1 of the MGCL and fiduciary duties under
the Company Charter, (B) each of the Company Board and the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (C) prior to taking
such action, the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with respect
to such proposal that contains confidentiality provisions no less restrictive
than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours) notify Parent after receipt by the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions thereof, to
the extent known, the identity of the third

discussions or negotiations (including any material amendments to the
proposal) between the Company and the Person making such proposal.

  

### 

  

### (c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company Board and the Special
Committee shall not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose to
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser, the
Company Recommendation or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, adopt or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal to holders of
the Company Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event an
Acquisition Proposal is made prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, each
of the Company Board and the Special Committee may take such action if the
Company has complied with the notice provisions set forth in the last
sentence of Section 6.04(b) and each has determined in good faith (x) after
consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in
order for such directors to comply with the directors statutory duties under
Section 2-405.1 of the MGCL and fiduciary duties under the Company Charter
and (y) after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. In the event
that the Company Board and the Special Committee comply with their respective
obligations in the preceding sentence, the Company may enter into a
definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, but not prior to such
time as the Company has provided Parent with written notice that the
Company has elected to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e)
and otherwise complied with the Companys obligations in the preceding
sentence and in Section 8.01(e).

  

###

contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or from making any other
disclosure to its stockholders or in any other regulatory filing if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board and the Special Committee, based on
the advice of their respective outside counsel, failure to so disclose would
be inconsistent with their or the Companys obligations under applicable Law
(it being understood that nothing in this Section 6.04(d) shall affect
Parents termination rights under Section 8.01(f)).

  

### 

  

## SECTION 6.05. _Employees and Employee Benefits Matters_. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall hire any natural person as an
employee, nor will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enter into any
agreement with a natural person for the provision of services to the Company

Employee Plan.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.06. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.
(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation Charter and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws shall contain
provisions for the indemnification to the full extent permitted by Law of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which
provisions shall not be

  



        
   

  



  

## amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of those individuals, unless such modification shall be
required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

  

## 

  

### (b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall,
jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
or any applicable contract or agreement in effect on the date hereof and
made available to Parent, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, each present and former director and officer of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of or pertaining to any action or omission, or alleged act or omission, in
their capacity as an officer or director, whether occurring before or at the
Effective Time, for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the event
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification hereunder shall promptly notify Parent
upon learning of same; provided that the failure to so notify shall not
relieve Parent of any liability it may have hereunder except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Parent. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received and
(ii) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this Section 6.06(b) to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (in addition to local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in
any single action except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified
Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action; and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that, in the event that any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made within such six year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of such claim shall continue until the
disposition of such claim.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six years from
the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time
containing terms and conditions that are not in the aggregate less favorable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.06(c) more than an amount per
year equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of an expiration,
termination or cancellation of such current policies, Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
maximum annual amount in aggregate annual premiums.

  



        
   

  



  

### (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or assigns, to maintain the
policies and honor the obligations provided for in this Section 6.06.

  

### 

  

### (e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.06. The
provisions of this Section 6.06 are intended for the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and representatives.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 6.07. _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including using its reasonable best efforts
to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and orders of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the
Company and its Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and to fulfill the conditions to the Merger.
In case, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take all such action. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall discuss in good faith and agree to
increase the amount of the Cash Consideration (subject to a corresponding
decrease in the amount of the Stock Consideration) in the event that it is
determined that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger and the Advisor Merger would require the approval of
the stockholders of Parent under the listing standards of the NYSE.

  

## 

  

### (b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in
connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 6.07(a),
including the preparation and making of any filings referred to therein and,
if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder,

providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and their
advisors prior to filing, and to the extent practicable and permissible under
applicable Law neither of the parties will file any such document or have any
communication with any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with
the other party. Each party shall keep the other apprised reasonably promptly
of the content and status of any communications with, and communications
from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the extent practicable and permitted by a
Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the
other party to participate in meetings and calls with such Governmental
Authority.

  

### 

  

### (c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, the Company
shall, with respect to any U.S. federal tax filing relating to the REIT
status of the Company that is filed

  



        
   

  



  

### by the Company between the date hereof and Closing, give Parent
a reasonable opportunity to comment on such filing before it is filed with
the IRS and shall accept any reasonable comments (the reasonableness of which
shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion) that are provided
by Parent with respect to the content of such filing.

  

### 

  

### (d) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any Action, including administrative
or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or
prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

  

### 

  

## SECTION 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Merger shall be issued by either party without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.09. _Affiliates_. Prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of
those Persons who are, in the Companys reasonable judgment, as of the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company within the
meaning of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. There shall be added to such
list the names and addresses of any other Person subsequently identified by
the Company (in consultation with Parent) as a Person who may be deemed to be
such an affiliate of the Company. The Company shall exercise its reasonable
efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Closing,
from each affiliate of the Company identified in the foregoing list (as the
same may be supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the Closing Date
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ (the " _Affiliate Letter_
").

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.10. _Dividends_. The Company and Parent shall coordinate the
declaration, setting of record dates and payment dates of dividends on shares
of Company Common Stock and Parent Common Stock so that holders of shares of
Company Common Stock do not receive dividends on both shares of Company
Common Stock and shares of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in
respect of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs or fail to
receive a dividend on either shares of Company Common Stock or shares of
Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of such calendar
quarter; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein is intended to prevent
holders of shares of Company Common Stock from receiving a dividend on (i)
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to the period from the beginning
of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs to the Closing Date, and
(ii) on shares of Parent Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of
shares of

  



        
   

  



  

## Company Common Stock with respect to the period from the Closing Date to
the end of the calendar quarter in which the Closing occurs.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.11. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws to enable
the deregistration of the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 6.12. _1031 Exchange_. The Company agrees to cooperate, subject to
the restrictions and conditions stated herein, should Parent elect to
acquire, immediately before and in connection with the closing of the Merger,
one or more of the Companys assets as part of a like-kind exchange under
Section 1031 of the Code (such assets thus acquired hereinafter referred to
as "Replacement Properties"), including the execution of such documents and
the taking of such actions as Parent may reasonably request to complete the
acquisition of the Replacement Properties immediately prior to and in
connection with the closing of the Merger, provided, however, (i) that any
such like-kind exchange shall be consummated through the use of a qualified
intermediary or exchange accommodation titleholder (the "Assignee"); (ii)
Parents contemplated exchange shall not impose upon the Company any cost,
additional liability or financial obligation, and Parent agrees to hold the
Company harmless from any liability that might arise in connection with such
exchange. The Company agrees to cooperate with Parent in attempting to close
the acquisition of the Replacement Properties two days before the closing for
the Merger; provided however that the Company may refuse to consent to an
acquisition of the Replacement Properties that does not close immediately
before and in connection with the Merger if Company in its sole discretion
believes that an earlier closing could have adverse consequences to the
Company. Without limiting the generality of the immediate preceding sentence,
any real property transfer, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer
and stamp taxes, stamp duties, and any transfer, recording, registration and
other fees, charges, premiums and any similar taxes shall be borne solely by
Parent; and Parent shall unconditionally guarantee the full and timely
performance by the Assignee of each and every one of the representations,
warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings of the Parent under
this Agreement (and any amendments or modifications hereto) that relate to
the Replacement Properties. As such guarantor, Parent shall be treated as
primary obligor with respect to those representations, warranties,
indemnities, obligations and undertakings, and, in the event of breach, the
Company may proceed directly against Parent on this guarantee without the
need to join Assignee.

  

## 

  

In the event any exchange contemplated by Parent should fail to occur, for
whatever reason, the Merger shall nonetheless be consummated as provided
herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company makes no representation or warranty, and undertakes no other
obligation, in each case with respect to the tax consequences of
the transactions referred to in this Section 6.12 (including whether the

  



        
   

  



  

transactions qualify under Section 1031 of the Code) and shall not be
responsible for any loss or liability relating to any tax liability to Parent
from such transactions.

### 

  

## SECTION 8.04. _Deferral Provisions to Insure Compliance with REIT Gross
Income Tests_. (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
any payments otherwise to be made by the Parent to the Company pursuant to
Section 8.03(c) or by the Company to Parent under Section 8.02 or Section
8.03(b) for any calendar year shall not exceed the sum of (a) the amount that
it is determined should not be gross income of the party receiving such
payment (the "Receiving Party") for purposes of the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, with such determination to be set forth in an
opinion of outside tax counsel selected by the Receiving Party (the "
_Counsel s Gross Income Opinion_") plus (b) such additional amount that it
is estimated can be paid to the Receiving Party in such taxable year without

  



        
   

  



  

## creating a risk that the payment would cause the Receiving Party to fail
to meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Section 856(c)(2)(A) -(H) and 856(c)(3)(A) - (I) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), which determination shall be made by independent tax accountants
to the Receiving Party and (c) in the event the Receiving Party receives a
letter from outside tax counsel to the Receiving Party (" _Counsel s Ruling
Letter_") indicating that Receiving Party has received a ruling from the
Internal Revenue Service holding that the Receiving Partys receipt of the
additional amount otherwise to be paid under Section 8.03(c) either would
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income of the
Receiving Party for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the "
_Specified REIT Requirements_ "), the aggregate payments otherwise required
to be made under this Agreement (determined without regard to this Section
8.04) less the amount otherwise previously paid under clauses (a) and (b)
above. The obligation of the party required to make such payment (the "Paying
Party") to pay any unpaid portion of the payment otherwise required under
this Agreement that remains unpaid solely by reason of this Section 8.04
shall terminate five years from the date such payment otherwise would have
been made but for this Section 8.04.

  

## 

  

### (b) The Paying Party shall place the full amount of any payments
otherwise to be made by the Paying Party to the Receiving Party under Section
8.02 or 8.03(c) or 8.03(d), as the case may be, in a mutually agreed escrow
account upon mutually acceptable terms which shall provide that any portion
thereof shall not be released to the Receiving Party unless and until the
Paying Party receives any of the following: (x) a letter from the Receiving
Partys independent tax accountants indicating the amount that it is
estimated can be paid at the time to the Receiving Party without creating a
risk that the payment would cause the Receiving Party to fail to meet the
Specified REIT Requirements for the taxable year in which the payment would
be made, which determination shall be made by such independent tax
accountants, (y) Counsels Ruling Letter or (z) an opinion of outside
tax counsel selected by the Receiving Party, to the effect that, based upon
a change in Law or interpretation after the date on which payment was
first deferred hereunder, receipt of the additional amount otherwise to be
paid under this Agreement either would be excluded from gross income of the
Receiving Party for purposes of the Specified REIT Requirements or would
constitute Qualifying Income, in any of which events the Paying Party shall
pay to the Receiving Party the lesser of the unpaid amounts due under this
Agreement (determined without regard to this Section 8.04 or the maximum
amount stated in the letter referred to in clause (x) above). At the end of
the five year period referred to above in this Section 8.04 with respect to
any amount placed in such escrow, if none of the events referred to in
clauses (x), (y) or (z) or the preceding sentences shall have occurred, such
amount shall be released from such escrow to be used as determined by the
Paying Party in its sole and absolute discretion.

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby

hereof and supersedes, except as set forth in Section 6.03(c), all prior

of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and any of
the rights or obligations hereunder shall not be assigned (whether pursuant
to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise) by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties and any such purported
assignment shall be null and void, except that Parent and Purchaser may
assign all or any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided that no such assignment shall relieve
the assigning party of its obligations hereunder and such assignment does not
alter the type or amount of the Merger Consideration and would not and would
not reasonably be likely to prevent, materially delay or materially impair
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.05. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this

reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.06 (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and may be enforced by such
parties).

  



        
   

  



  

## SECTION 9.06. _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy shall
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this

Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the parties
are entitled at Law or in equity.

by the MGCL). All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any New York state or
federal court sitting in New York, New York (Borough of Manhattan). The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such
court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action,
any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by any of the
above-named courts. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 9.02 as to giving
notice hereunder shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
