holder  thereof be converted   7    automatically into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $43.25  payable, without interest, to the
holder of such share of Company Common  Stock, upon surrender of the
Certificate that formerly evidenced such share  of Company Common Stock
and/or Restricted Stock Agreement in the manner  provided in Section 2.5 (the
"Merger Consideration").   (b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent
or Sub  shall be cancelled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or 
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) At the Effective
Time, all shares of the Company Common Stock  converted pursuant to Section
2.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and  shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and cease to exist, and each  holder of a Certificate and/or
Restricted Stock Agreement shall cease to  have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the  Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.4(a).   (d) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Sub  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be  converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable  share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving  Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital  stock of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.5. Surrender of
Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer Books.   (a) Not less than
five days prior to the Shareholders\' Meeting, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock reasonably acceptable to the Company to
receive the funds necessary to make the payments to such holders pursuant to
Section 2.4 upon surrender of their Certificates and/or Restricted Stock
Agreements. Parent will, on or prior to the Effective Time, deposit with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
all of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding at the Effective
Time, including shares covered by Company Restricted Stock Awards (whether
vested or unvested), but excluding shares cancelled pursuant to Section
2.4(b) (the "Fund"). The Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments, shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation.
Parent shall replace any monies lost through any investment made pursuant to
this Section 2.5(a). The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided in
Section 2.4.   (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective
Time, a holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4, including shares
covered by Company Restricted Stock Awards (whether vested or unvested), a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates and/or the Restricted Stock
Agreements to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates and/or the Restricted Stock Agreements pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate and/or the Restricted Stock Agreement, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate and/or the Restricted Stock
Agreement shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate and each share covered by a Company Restricted Stock Award
(whether vested or unvested), and such Certificate and/or Restricted Stock
Agreement shall then be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate and each Restricted Stock Agreement shall, at and after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of any
Certificate or any Restricted Stock Agreement with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or Restricted
Stock Agreement. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered on the   8   stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed
in blank or to the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. If any Certificate or
Restricted Stock Agreement shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
or Restricted Stock Agreement to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate or Restricted Stock Agreement, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate or
Restricted Stock Agreement the applicable Merger Consideration such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.4.   (c) At any time following the
day that is one hundred eighty days after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any portion of the Fund which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock (including,
without limitation, all interest and other income received by the Paying
Agent in respect of all amounts held in the Fund or other funds made
available to it), and thereafter each such holder shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Laws), and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to
any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Restricted Stock Agreements held by such holder. If
any Certificates or Restricted Stock Agreements shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate or Restricted Stock Agreement would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such cash,
shares, dividends or distributions payable in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a share of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law.   (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, except for Parent, the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including shares covered by Company Restricted Stock Awards (whether vested
or unvested), shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable
Law, and all cash paid pursuant to this Article II upon the surrender or
exchange of Certificates or Restricted Stock Agreements shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Restricted Stock Agreement.   (e) Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, including shares
covered by Company Restricted Stock Awards (whether vested or unvested), such
amounts that Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.   9    SECTION 2.6. Company Stock
Awards. Parent will, at or subsequent to the Effective Time, cause the
Surviving Corporation to make the payments set forth in this Section 2.6.  
(a) (i) Each outstanding Company Stock Award that is an option to
acquire Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") shall be cancelled
and shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount equal to the difference between (A) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (such amount,
the "Company Stock Option Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all Company
Stock Options converted pursuant to this Section 2.6(a) shall no longer be
outstanding, and each holder of an Option Agreement shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Company Stock
Option Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.6(a)(i).   (ii)
Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to
be mailed to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
a Company Stock Option entitled to receive the Company Stock Option
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i) a form of letter of transmittal
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the agreements
granting the Company Stock Option (the "Option Agreements"). Upon surrender
to the Surviving Corporation of an Option Agreement, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Option Agreement shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Company Stock Option
Consideration for the Company Stock Options formerly evidenced by such Option
Agreement, and such Option Agreement shall then be cancelled. No interest
shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial owner of Company Stock Options or
any holder of any Option Agreement with respect to the Company Stock Option
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Option Agreement. If
any Option Agreement shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making
of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Option Agreement to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
the Surviving Corporation or Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Option Agreement, the
Surviving Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Option Agreement the applicable Company Stock Option Consideration
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(i).   (b) At
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each participant
in the Company\'s employee stock purchase plan (the "Company ESPP"), in
exchange for the cancellation of such participant\'s rights under the
Company ESPP, an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the Merger
Consideration by (ii) the number of shares (and fractional shares) of Company
Common Stock that could be purchased for the participant under the Company
ESPP based on the total contributions credited to the participant under the
Company ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time and an exercise price of
$33.78 per share, and each participant\'s rights under the Company ESPP shall
thereafter be cancelled.   (c) At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each participant in the Company\'s "Equity Swap
Program" (i.e., notional shares credited to the Deferred Stock Account under
the Executive Incentive Plan (the "ESP Shares")), in exchange for the
cancellation of the ESP Shares, an amount determined by multiplying (i) the
Merger Consideration by (ii) the number of ESP Shares credited to the
participant (whether or not vested) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and each ESP Share shall thereafter be cancelled.   (d) Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Company Stock Award Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Stock Awards such amounts that Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making   10   of such payment under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Stock
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.   ARTICLE III.   THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION   SECTION 3.1. Articles of Incorporation. At the
Effective Time, the Company Articles of Incorporation shall be amended and
restated as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto, so that they shall be
identical to the articles of incorporation of Sub in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or
repealed in accordance with the VSCA or the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 3.2. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Company Bylaws shall be amended and restated as set forth on Exhibit C
attached hereto, so that they shall be identical to the bylaws of Sub in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or
repealed in accordance with the VSCA, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION
3.3. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed in accordance with applicable Law, (a) the
directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE IV.  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the

as presently conducted and (c) is duly qualified or licensed to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has furnished

of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws affecting the enforceability of creditors\' rights
generally, general equitable principles and the discretion of courts in
granting equitable remedies (regardless of whether the issue of
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).   (b) At
a meeting duly called and held on May 14, 2005, the Board of Directors of the

from a financial point of view. A copy of such opinion is included in the
Company Disclosure Letter.   SECTION 4.3. Capitalization. The authorized
capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common

exercisability, if applicable. Except as set forth above or in the
Company Disclosure Letter, there are no options, warrants, convertible
securities, subscriptions, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans or
stock equivalents or other rights, agreements, including shareholder
rights agreements, arrangements or commitments (contingent or otherwise) of
any character issued or authorized by the Company relating to the issued or
unissued capital stock of the Company or obligating the Company to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or options, warrants, convertible
securities, subscriptions or other equity interests in, the Company. All
shares of capital stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on
the terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they
are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected,
except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which could not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.  
SECTION 4.6. Required Filings and Consents. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by the Company will not, require any consent, approval,

Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.7. Compliance. Each of the Company and

to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries or by which any property, business

Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.8. Litigation. There is no Litigation pending

Reports; Financial Statements.   (a) The Company and each Subsidiary, as
necessary, has filed all forms, reports, statements and documents required to
be filed with any regulatory authority established by Law in a foreign
jurisdiction, except for cases where the failure to make such filing would

with the SEC since the Spin-Off Date (those required to be filed with the SEC
are collectively referred to as the "SEC Reports," and together with any
foreign jurisdiction reports, the "Government Reports"), each of which
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or, in
the case of a foreign jurisdiction, the relevant Laws of that jurisdiction,
each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the Government Reports
(including, but not limited to, any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein) contained when filed
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.   (b) The principal executive officer
of the Company and the principal financial officer of the Company have made
the certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company\'s filings pursuant to the
Exchange Act. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.   (c) All of the Company Financial
Statements, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with
the SEC or with relevant authorities in foreign jurisdictions, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of the unaudited statements, as may be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC
and subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal, recurring
audit adjustments) and fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the
respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and
changes in cash flows for the periods indicated.   (d) There are no
liabilities of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,
whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute, that are
material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than
(i) liabilities disclosed or provided for in the Company Financial
Statements, (ii) liabilities disclosed in the SEC Reports, (iii) liabilities
incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
contemplated Merger, and (iv) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2005, none of which in
the case of clause (iv) are, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to be material to the Company.   (e) The Company has heretofore
furnished or made available to Parent and listed in the Company Disclosure
Letter a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which
have not yet been filed with the SEC to agreements, documents or other
instruments which previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC as
exhibits to the SEC Reports pursuant to the Securities Act and the  
14   rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.   SECTION 4.10. Absence
of Certain Changes or Events. Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as
disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since December
31, 2004, the Company and the Subsidiaries have conducted their respective
businesses in the ordinary course and consistent with prior practice and
there has not been (a) any event or occurrence of any condition that has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or any other
distribution with respect to any of the capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary other than the expected payment of the Company\'s second quarter
dividend of $.04 per share of Company Common Stock on or about June 16, 2005,
(c) any material change in accounting methods, principles or practices
employed by the Company, or (d) any action of the type described in Section
6.1(b) which had such action been taken after the date of this
Agreement would be in violation of such Section.   SECTION 4.11. Taxes.  
(a) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has filed all income and
other material Tax Returns (determined both individually and in the
aggregate) that it was required to file. All Combined Groups have filed all
income and other material Tax Returns (determined both individually and in
the aggregate) that (i) it was required to file and (ii) for which any Taxes
reflected thereon could be assessed against one or more of the Company and
the Subsidiaries. All such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all
material respects. All material amounts of Taxes owed by any of the Company
and the Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been paid
if due or adequately provided for in the Company Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP. None of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file
any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company or any Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or
may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. There are no
security interests on any of the assets of any of the Company and the
Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure)
to pay any Tax.   (b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries has withheld
and paid all material amounts of Taxes required to have been withheld and
paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party.   (c) There is no
audit, dispute or claim concerning any material amount of Tax liability of
any of the Company or the Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
for which any of such Persons could be held responsible either (i) claimed or
raised by any authority in writing or (ii) as to which any of the directors,
officers and employees responsible for Tax matters of the Company and the

income tax purposes in all jurisdictions where state income tax returns are
filed by the Company or such Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has knowledge through any of its officers or employees responsible
for Tax matters of any basis or claim on which such election could be held to
be invalid. In connection with the transaction giving rise to such election,
the Company (i) entered into a tax allocation agreement that is currently
binding on all of the parties thereto and (ii) performed such valuations as
it deemed prudent in connection with effecting such election. The Company has
provided true, correct and complete copies of all such documentation to

valid leasehold interests in, all tangible personal properties and assets

absence of such ownership or leasehold interest could not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.13. Real
Property.   (a) Except as set forth in the 10-K, the Company and the
Subsidiaries have good and marketable fee simple title to, or a valid
leasehold interest in, all of their real properties reflected in the 10-K or

covenant, agreement, term or condition of or contained in any lease of Leased
Real Property to which it is a party and there has not occurred any event

such a default or breach, except for such breaches or defaults that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, the consummation of the transactions
provided for herein will not create or constitute a default under any real
property lease covering the Leased Real Property that requires payments by
the Company or any Subsidiary in excess of $250,000 per year.   (c) All

any Subsidiary has incurred, and no fact exists that reasonably could
be expected to result in, liability to the Company or a Subsidiary as a

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, registered,
qualified, invested, operated and administered in all material respects in

penalty or fee under ERISA, the Code or any Applicable Benefit Law (other
than to pay premiums, contributions or benefits in the ordinary course under
the Current Company Benefit Plans identified in the Company Disclosure
Letter), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no
fact or circumstance exists that could adversely affect the tax-exempt status
of a Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be tax-exempt. Further, each
Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code and the trusts maintained thereunder that are intended to
be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or other letter indicating that the form of the
Company Benefit Plan satisfies Section 401(a) of the Code.   (g) No Company
Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) for current or former employees,

periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service,

contributions or premiums required to be made by the Company or
any Subsidiary under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan or by Applicable
Benefit Laws have been made in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms
of the Company Benefit Plan and Applicable Benefit Law. The liabilities of
each Current Company Benefit Plan are either fully insured, fully funded by
assets held in a segregated account or trust or fully reserved as a liability
on the books of the Company or applicable Subsidiary in accordance with GAAP,
considering each such plan as material for purposes of applying GAAP reserve
requirements.   (i) The Company or a Subsidiary has the right under the
terms of each Company Benefit Plan and under Applicable Benefit Law to amend,
revise, merge or terminate such plan (or its participation in such plan) or
transfer the assets of such plan to another arrangement, plan or fund at any
time exclusively by action of the Company or such Subsidiary.   (j) The
execution, delivery and performance of, and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee, director, officer, consultant, independent contractors, contingent
worker or leased employee (or any of their dependents, spouses
or beneficiaries) of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or (iii) increase the amount of compensation due any such
individual.   (k) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened complaint, claim (other than a routine claim for benefits),

of any kind in or before any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan and, to   20   the Knowledge of the Company, there exists
no state of facts that after notice or lapse of time or both reasonably could

or other proceeding or to affect the registration of any Company Benefit Plan
required to be registered.   SECTION 4.17. Labor Relations.   (a) None of

SECTION 4.20. Intellectual Property.   (a) The Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list of (i) the Intellectual Property Rights
and (ii) the Licensed Rights. The Company represents and warrants that,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (A) the Company and the Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to the Intellectual Property Rights; (B) the Company and the
Subsidiaries possess licenses or other valid rights to use the Licensed
Rights; (C) the Intellectual Property Rights are free and clear of any liens,
claims, other than any claim as to the validity of any pending application
for patent, trademark, service mark, trade name or copyright protection,
which claim is made to the authority issuing such protection, which claims
are set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, or encumbrances, are
not subject to any license (royalty bearing or royalty free) and are not
subject to any other arrangement requiring any payment to any Person or the
obligation to grant rights to any Person in exchange; (D) the Licensed Rights
are free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or royalties arising
from the action of Company or any of the Subsidiaries; provided that the
Licensed Rights may be subject to royalties payable by Company or its
Subsidiaries to the entity granting such Licensed Rights to Company or its
Subsidiaries, the method by which royalties are calculated appearing in the
document or attachments thereto granting such Licensed Rights to Company or
its Subsidiaries; and (E) the Intellectual Property Rights and the Licensed
Rights are all those rights pertaining to patents, copyrights, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, trade secrets, databases, and Company Software
that are   23   necessary to the conduct of the business of each of the
Company, the Subsidiaries and the Company\'s Affiliates as presently
conducted. The validity of the Intellectual Property Rights and title thereto
and validity of the Licensed Rights, (x) have not been questioned in any
prior Litigation; (y) are not being questioned in any pending Litigation; and
(z) to the Knowledge of the Company, are not the subject(s) of any threatened
or proposed Litigation. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the business of each of
the Company and the Subsidiaries, as presently conducted, does not infringe
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, has not been alleged to infringe any
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks or copyrights or
misappropriate any trade secret rights of others. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of
any of the Intellectual Property Rights or the Company\'s or
the Subsidiaries\' right to use any of the Licensed Rights, except where such
losses or impairments would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are
no third parties using any of the Intellectual Property Rights material to
the business of the Company or the Subsidiaries as presently conducted.  
(b) The Company Disclosure Letter lists all of the material
Company Proprietary Software. The Company has developed the Company
Proprietary Software through its own efforts, as described in Section
4.20(d), and for its own account, and the Company and the Subsidiaries have
all right, title and interest in and to all intellectual property rights in
the Company Proprietary Software, free and clear of all mortgages, liens,
pledges, security interests, charges, claims, restrictions and encumbrances
of any nature whatsoever, except for such mortgages, liens, pledges, security
interests, charges, claims, restrictions and encumbrances that would not,
individually or in the aggregate have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
use of the Company Licensed Software and the use of the Company Proprietary
Software by the Company or its Subsidiaries does not breach any terms of any
license or other contract between the Company or any Subsidiary and any third
party, except for such breaches that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and the
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all license
agreements in favor of the Company and the Subsidiaries relating to the
Company Licensed Software, except where the failure to comply would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (c) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company Proprietary
Software does not infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade name or
service mark or misappropriate any trade secret of any third party. The
source code for the Company Proprietary Software has been maintained in
confidence.   (d) The Company Proprietary Software was: (i) developed by the
employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries working within the scope of
their employment at the time of such development; (ii) developed by agents,
consultants, contractors or others who have executed appropriate instruments
of assignment in favor of the Company or any Subsidiary as assignee that have
conveyed to the Company or such Subsidiary ownership of the intellectual
property rights in the Company Proprietary Software; or (iii) acquired by the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with acquisitions in which the
Company or any Subsidiary obtained representations, warranties and
indemnities that the Company reasonably deemed appropriate from the
transferring party relating to the title to such Company Proprietary
Software. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received written notice
from any third party claiming any right, title or interest in the Company
Proprietary Software.   (e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
granted rights in Company Software to any third party.   SECTION 4.21.
Insurance Policies. The Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
correct list of the Company Insurance Policies. The Company has delivered or
made available to Parent prior to the date hereof a complete and accurate
list of all insurance policies in force naming the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries or employees thereof as an insured or beneficiary or as a
loss payable payee or for which the Company or any Subsidiary has paid or
is obligated to pay all or part of the premiums. With respect to each
Company Insurance Policy, the Company Disclosure Letter specifies (a) the
insurer, (b) the amount of and nature of coverage, (c) the risk insured
against, (d) the deductible amount (if   24   any) and (e) the date
through which coverage will continue by virtue of premiums already paid. The
Company and the Subsidiaries have, and, all times since the Spin-Off Date,
have had, in effect insurance coverage with reputable insurers which, in
respect of amounts, premiums, types and risks insured, the Company believes
constitutes reasonable coverage against all risks customarily insured against
by corporations comparable in size and operations to the Company and
the Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has reached or
exceeded its policy limits for any insurance policies in effect at any time
during the past five years. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
required to maintain pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, and does not
maintain, insurance with respect to any Customer Inventory. With respect to
each Company Insurance Policy, (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received written notice of any pending or threatened cancellation or premium
increase (retroactive or otherwise) with respect thereto; (ii) the policy is
legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect; (iii) the
policy will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full
force and effect on identical terms through the Closing and following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein; (iv) neither the
Company, any Subsidiary, nor any other party to any Company Insurance Policy
is in breach or default (including with respect to the payment of premiums or
giving of notices), and no event has occurred which, with notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a breach or default, or permit
termination, modification or acceleration, under such policy; (v) no party
has repudiated any provision thereof; (vi) there are no pending claims
against such insurance as to which insurers are defending under reservation
of rights or have denied liability; and (vii) there exists no claim under
such insurance policy that has not been properly filed by the Company or any
Subsidiary, except in the case of clauses (ii) through (vii) above as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   SECTION 4.22. Notes Receivable. There are no notes receivable of
the Company or any Subsidiary owing by any director, officer, shareholder
or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, other than notes receivable of
the Company or any Subsidiary owing by any non-officer employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary issued in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.   SECTION 4.23. Transactions with
Affiliates. Except as set forth in the SEC Reports (other than compensation
and benefits received in the ordinary course of business as an employee or
director of the Company or the Subsidiaries), no director, officer or other
Affiliate or Associate of the Company or any Subsidiary or any entity in
which, to the Knowledge of the Company, any such director, officer or other
Affiliate or Associate, owns any beneficial interest (other than a publicly
held corporation whose stock is traded on a national securities exchange or
in the over-the-counter market and less than 1% of the stock of which is
beneficially owned by any such Persons) has any interest in: (a) any
contract, arrangement or understanding with, or relating to the business or
operations of, the Company or any Subsidiary; (b) any loan, arrangement,
understanding, agreement or contract for, or relating to, indebtedness of the
Company or any Subsidiary; or (c) any property (real, personal or mixed),
tangible, or intangible, used or currently intended to be used in, the

Company or any Subsidiary has cancelled, terminated, or made any threat to
cancel or otherwise terminate its contract, or to decrease its usage of the
Company\'s or any Subsidiary\'s services or products that would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any notice that, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is not,
any current customer or supplier may terminate or materially alter its
business relations with the Company or any Subsidiary, either as a result
of the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise, that would result in
a Company Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.25. Ethical Practices. The
Company and each Subsidiary is (and has been at all times) in compliance with
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (15 U.S.C. sec.sec. 78dd-1, -1 and -3).

or given, and, no Person has offered or given on its behalf, anything of
value to: (a) any foreign official, any foreign political party or official
thereof or any candidate for political office; or (b) any Person, while
knowing that all or a portion of such thing of value will be offered, given,
or promised, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, to any  
25   foreign political party or official thereof, or to any candidate for
foreign political office for the purpose of the following: (i) influencing
any act or decision of such foreign official, political party, party
official, or candidate in his or its official capacity, inducing such foreign
official, political party, party official, or candidate to do or omit to do
any act in violation of the lawful duty of such foreign official, political
party, party official, or candidate, or securing any improper advantage or
(ii) inducing such foreign official, political party, party official, or
candidate to use his or its influence with a foreign government or
instrumentality thereof to affect or influence any act or decision of such
government or instrumentality, in order to assist the Company or any
Subsidiary in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing
business to, any Person.   SECTION 4.26. Customs Matters. Since January 1,
2002, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has acted as an
"importer of record," as that term is defined in 19 U.S.C. sec. 1484, on
import entry documentation required by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border
Protection ("Customs"). The Company and each Subsidiary possesses all
Licenses required to conduct their respective businesses in accordance with
the Laws enforced by Customs, including 19 U.S.C. sec. 1623, 19 U.S.C. sec.
1641 and 19 C.F.R. sec. 111, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All such Licenses are
currently in full force and effect and no misrepresentations were made by the
Company or any Subsidiary of any material fact in obtaining them, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No administrative or judicial proceedings have been instituted or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or are contemplated by Customs
against the Company or any Subsidiary seeking fines, forfeitures, liquidated
damages, or penalties or the modification, revocation, or suspension of any
License required to conduct their respective businesses in accordance with
the Laws enforced by Customs, except for such administrative or
judicial proceedings that if resolved adversely to the Company or any
Subsidiary would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary is in material
compliance with all Laws enforced by Customs.   SECTION 4.27. Government
Contracts.   (a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been suspended
or debarred from bidding on contracts or subcontracts for any Governmental

action been commenced. There is no valid basis for the suspension or
debarment of the Company or any Subsidiary from bidding on contracts or
subcontracts for any Governmental Entity.   (b) Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has, with respect to any contracts or subcontracts for any
Governmental Entity and within the preceding three years, received a cure

civil judgment rendered against it for (i) commission of fraud or a criminal
offense in connection with obtaining or attempting to obtain, or performing a
federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; (ii) violation of

any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement, the proper officers of each party to this Agreement and the
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all

required under the antitrust laws of any applicable jurisdiction with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby.   30    (b) In connection with,
and without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall (i) take all actions
necessary to ensure that no state antitakeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes operative with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any
state antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
operative with respect to this Agreement the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, take all actions necessary to ensure that
this Agreement the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 6.5. Board Recommendations.  
(a) In connection with the Merger and the Shareholders\' Meeting, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) subject to Section 6.5(b),
recommend to the holders of the Company Common Stock to approve the Plan of
Merger and this Agreement and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the necessary approvals by the Company Shareholders of the Plan of Merger and
this Agreement and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by
this Section 6.5(b), (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the
approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof of the Plan of Merger, this Agreement or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any transaction involving an
Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined) from a third party (an
"Alternative Transaction"), or (iii) cause the Company to enter into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to any
Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the
approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger by the Company
Shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after it has received a Superior Proposal in compliance with Section 6.9 and
after consultation with and having taken into consideration advice from
independent outside legal counsel with respect to its duties to the Company
and the Company Shareholders under applicable Virginia law, that such action
is likely required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with
its duties to the Company and the Company Shareholders under applicable
Virginia law, the Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and
the following sentences) inform the Company Shareholders that it no longer
believes that the Merger is advisable and that it no longer recommends
approval of the Plan of Merger (a "Subsequent Determination") and may enter
into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only
at a time that is after the fifth business day (or the second business day,
in the case of a material amendment to a Superior Proposal) following
Parent\'s receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal. Such
written notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (and include a copy thereof with all
accompanying documentation, if in writing), identify the Person making such
Superior Proposal and state that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to make a Subsequent Determination. During such five business day
period (or two business day period in the case of a material amendment), the
Company shall provide an opportunity for Parent to propose such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to
proceed with its recommendation to the Company Shareholders without a
Subsequent Determination. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into
an Alternative Transaction which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith business judgment (based on, among other things,
the advice of an independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
Company Shareholders than the Merger from a financial point of view (taking
into account, among other things, whether, in the good faith business
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after obtaining the advice
of such independent financial advisor, the third party is reasonably able to
finance the   31   transaction, and any proposed changes to this
Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to such Alternative
Transaction).   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14(e)-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to the Company Shareholders if, in the good faith
business judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
consultation with independent outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with applicable Law; provided, however, neither the
Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as
specifically permitted by Section 6.5(b), withdraw, qualify, or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, its position with respect to the Plan
of Merger or this Agreement or approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend an Alternative Transaction.   SECTION 6.6. Shareholder Litigation.
Unless and until the Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.1
hereof, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any shareholder Litigation against the Company and
its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Merger; provided, however, that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent\'s consent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.   SECTION 6.7. Indemnification.   (a) It is understood and
agreed that all rights to indemnification by the Company now existing in
favor of each present and former director and officer of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter Documents, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any
other indemnification agreements in effect on the date hereof, copies of
which have been provided to Parent, shall survive the Merger and Parent shall
(i) cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force and effect for
a period of at least six years from the Effective Time and (ii) perform, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving
Corporation\'s obligation with respect thereto. Parent and Sub agree that any
claims for indemnification hereunder as to which they have received written
notice prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive,
whether or not such claims shall have been finally adjudicated or
settled.   (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the
Effective Time, if available, the current directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policies covered by such policies (provided that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.7(b) more than an amount per
year equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of current annual premiums
paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation
would be required to expend more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of
current annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum
amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of current annual premiums. In lieu of
Parent causing the Surviving Corporation to maintain the policies as
described above, Parent may elect to cause the Company to purchase
immediately prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" pre-paid policy on
terms and conditions not materially less favorable than the current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies, such policy to be
effective as of the Effective Time.   (c) If the Surviving Corporation or
any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7.   (d) The rights of each current and former officer, director, employee
or agent under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights of such
Person under the Company Charter Documents or under Virginia   32   Law.
The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each present and former director, officer,
employee and agent of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their heirs and
their representatives.   (e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall unconditionally guarantee the timely performance of all obligations of
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.7.   SECTION 6.8. Public
Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as may be required in order to comply with Law or any listing agreement with
a national securities exchange or trading system to which Parent or
the Company is a party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 6.8, either party may respond to questions from employees
or stockholders or inquiries from financial analysts and media
representatives that is consistent with and no more expansive than then-
existing public disclosures.   SECTION 6.9. Acquisition Proposals. The
Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Subsidiaries
to, and shall instruct and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly take any other action to facilitate the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (b) participate in or knowingly
encourage any discussion or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person
any non-public information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, provided
that if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors reasonably believes may, upon clarification, constitute a
Superior Proposal, the Company may communicate in writing (with a copy to
Parent) with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal solely to the
limited extent necessary to obtain the necessary clarification; provided,
however, that prior to the approval of the Plan of Merger and this Agreement
by the Company Shareholders the foregoing shall not prohibit the Board of
Directors of the Company from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an Acquisition
Proposal that is unsolicited or that did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 6.9, if, and to the extent that, (i) the Board of Directors
of the Company, after consultation with and having taken into consideration
advice of independent outside legal counsel, determines in its good faith
business judgment that such action is likely required for the Board of
Directors of the Company to comply with its duties to the Company and the
Company Shareholders under applicable Virginia law, (ii) prior to taking such
action, the Company receives from such Person an executed agreement in
reasonably customary form relating to the confidentiality of information to
be provided to such Person; provided that such confidentiality agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall not be any less protective to the
Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) the
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company shall provide prompt
(but in any event by the following day) oral and written notice to Parent of
(A) the receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal and any clarification,
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry which
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (B) the
material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (C)
the identity of such Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry and (D) the Company\'s intention to furnish information to, or enter
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person. The Company shall
continue to keep Parent informed of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall cease and cause to be
terminated immediately all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any offer or proposal with
respect to a merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange,
tender offer, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving the Company, or any purchase or other
acquisition of 10% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or 10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.   33    SECTION 6.10. Shareholders\'
Meeting.   (a) The Company shall (i) cause the Shareholders\' Meeting to be
duly called and held as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger and (ii) take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter Documents to duly
call, give notice of, and convene the Shareholders\' Meeting.   (b) The
Company shall, at the direction of Parent, solicit from holders of shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Shareholders\' Meeting proxies
in favor of such approval and shall take all other action necessary or, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent, helpful to secure the vote or consent
of such holders required by the VSCA, the Company Charter Documents or
this Agreement to effect the Merger.   SECTION 6.11. Proxy Statement.  
(a) The Company will as promptly as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement file the Proxy Statement with the SEC and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC and to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company Shareholders at the
earliest practical time. The Company will notify the Parent promptly of the
receipt of the comments of the SEC, if any, and of any request by the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional
information with respect thereto, and will supply the Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If (i) at any time prior to the
Shareholders\' Meeting, any event should occur relating to the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries which should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly inform
Parent and (ii) if at any time prior to the Shareholders\' Meeting, any event
should occur relating to Parent or Sub or any of their respective Associates
or Affiliates, or relating to the plans of any such persons for the Company
after the Effective Time that should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent will promptly inform the Company,
and in the case of (i) or (ii) the Company will, upon learning of such event,
promptly prepare and file and, if required, mail such amendment or supplement
to the Company Shareholders; provided, however, that prior to such filing or
mailing, the Company and Parent shall consult with each other with respect to
such amendment or supplement and shall incorporate the other\'s comments
thereon.   (b) The Company hereby represents that the Company Financial
Advisor has, subject to the terms of its engagement letter with the Company
and the Board of Directors of the Company, consented to the inclusion of
references to its opinion in the Proxy Statement. The Company and its counsel
shall permit Parent and its counsel to participate in all communications with
the SEC and its staff, including any meetings and telephone conferences,
relating to the Proxy Statement, the Merger or this Agreement.   SECTION
6.12. Shareholder Lists. The Company shall promptly upon the request by
Parent, or shall cause its transfer agent to promptly, furnish Parent and Sub
with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders
of shares of Company Common Stock and with security position listings
of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of the
most recent practicable date, together with all other available listings and
computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of
record holders and beneficial owners of shares of Company Common Stock. The
Company shall furnish Parent and Sub with such additional information,
including, without limitation, updated listings and computer files of the
Company Shareholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such
other assistance as Parent, Sub or their agents may reasonably request.  
SECTION 6.13. Undertakings of Parent. Parent shall perform, or cause to be
performed, when due all obligations of Sub under this Agreement.   SECTION
6.14. Director Resignations. The Company shall cause to be delivered to
Parent resignations of all the directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries
to be effective upon the Effective   34   Time. The Company shall cause
such directors, prior to resignation, to appoint new directors nominated by
Parent to fill such vacancies.   SECTION 6.15. Company Stock Awards. As
promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of the holders of Company Stock
Awards to agree to the termination and expiration of their Company Stock
Awards immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger in exchange for
the Company Stock Award Consideration described in Section 2.6.   SECTION
6.16. Employee Matters.   (a) Company Benefit Plan Contributions. Prior to
the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall (or shall cause the
applicable Subsidiary to) (i) make all contributions under any Current
Company Benefit Plan, including any employer matching and profit sharing
contributions, required for periods ending on or before the consummation of
the Merger or (ii) with respect to each Current Company Benefit Plan that is
not fully funded or fully insured, fully reserve as a liability on the books
of the Company or applicable Subsidiary in accordance with GAAP, considering
each such plan as material for purposes of applying GAAP reserve
requirements, all liabilities for benefits accrued under such plan as of the
consummation of the Merger.   (b) Other Actions. Parent and the Company
agree to take those actions identified on Exhibit D attached hereto.   (c)
Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards. The long-term incentive plan awards granted
on January 21, 2004 (the "LTIP Awards") shall be paid in accordance
with Section 6.16(c)(i) or, with the consent of the participant, shall be
amended prior to the consummation of the Merger to provide for payment in
accordance with Section 6.16(c)(ii).   (i) Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.16(c)(ii), each LTIP Award  shall be paid to each participant on
the consummation of the Merger on  account of achieving the target
performance objectives. Each participant  shall be deemed to have earned the
number of performance shares scheduled  to be earned on account of achieving
the target performance objectives.  Each participant shall be deemed to have
earned the cash payment scheduled  to be earned on account of achieving the
target performance objectives.  Each participant shall receive a single sum
payment equal to the cash  payout under the LTIP Award assuming achievement
of the target performance  objectives plus an amount determined by
multiplying (x) the Merger  Consideration by (y) the number of performance
shares earned under the LTIP  Award assuming achievement of the target
performance objectives. The amount  payable under this Section 6.16(c)(i)
shall be paid in a single cash  payment at the Effective Time.   (ii) With
the consent of a participant, the participant\'s LTIP Award  shall be amended
to provide: (A) that such participant shall be deemed to  have earned the
cash payment scheduled to be earned on account of achieving  the maximum
performance objectives, (B) that such participant shall be  deemed to have
earned the number of performance shares scheduled to be  earned on account of
achieving the maximum performance objectives, and (C)  that such participant
shall receive a single sum payment equal to the  amount described in the
following sentence if the participant continues  employment with the Company
or Parent (or any affiliate thereof) until the  second anniversary of the
consummation of the Merger (or January 1, 2007,  in the case of the LTIP
Award held by Leo Suggs if he consents to the  application of this Section
6.16(c)(ii)) or if the participant\'s employment  ends before such date, as
applicable, on account of death, disability or a  termination without Cause
or a resignation with Good Reason. The amount  payable to such participant is
equal to the maximum cash payout under the  LTIP Award assuming achievement
of the maximum performance objectives plus  an amount determined by
multiplying (x) the Merger Consideration by (y) the  number of performance
shares earned under the LTIP Award assuming  achievement of the maximum
performance objectives. Any amount payable  pursuant to such amendment shall
be paid in a single cash payment on the  second anniversary of the
consummation of the Merger or, if such date is  not a   35    business
day, on the immediately succeeding day (or January 2, 2007, in the  case of
Leo Suggs). For purposes of the amended LTIP Awards and this  Section
6.16(c)(ii), the terms "Cause" and "Good Reason" shall have the  same meaning
as set forth in the Stock Incentive Plan.   (d) Information. Prior to the
consummation of the Merger, the Company shall provide Parent, if available
from existing records of the Company or any Subsidiaries, the following:  
(i) a schedule that contains a true and complete list of (A) all of  the
officers of the Company and each Subsidiary as of the date hereof,

Purchaser for each of them, (B) all of the employees (whether full-time,

independent contractors as of the date hereof, specifying  the nature of the
services performed and the consulting or other  independent contractor fees
and any other information reasonably requested  by the Purchaser; and  
(ii) true, correct and complete copies of each written consent by an  officer

approval of matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
Company Shareholders:   (a) By mutual written consent of duly authorized
representatives of  Parent and the Company;   (b) By any of Parent, Sub or
the Company if any court of competent  jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity shall have issued an order,  decree, ruling or taken any other action

pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall  use all commercially reasonable
efforts to have such order, decree, ruling  or action vacated;   (c) By any
of Parent, Sub or the Company if the Merger shall not have  been consummated
on or before November 15, 2005; provided, however, that  the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not  be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under  this   37   
Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure to 
consummate the Merger on or before such date;   (d) By Parent or Sub if the
Board of Directors of the Company (i)  shall have withdrawn or shall have
modified in a manner adverse to Parent  or Sub its approval or recommendation

into an Acquisition Agreement  with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
shall have approved or  recommended any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) shall

Parent and Sub, (ii) the Company shall breach in any  material respect any of
its covenants or other obligations hereunder or  (iii) the Company shall
breach any representation or warranty hereunder  (without giving effect to
any materiality or Company Material Adverse  Effect qualifications) and such
breach of a representation or warranty,  together with all other such
breaches, would entitle Parent or Sub not to  consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 7.2(a). The  foregoing notwithstanding, if
in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii), the  breach giving rise to the right of
termination is capable of being cured,  the Parent or Sub may not exercise

after written notice of such breach to  the Company from Parent, such breach
shall not have been cured in all  material respects or waived by Parent or
Sub and the Company shall not have  provided reasonable assurance to Parent
and Sub, in the reasonable  discretion of Parent and Sub, that such breach

shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been  waived by
the Company or (ii) Parent or Sub shall breach in any material  respect any
of their respective obligations hereunder or (iii) Parent or  Sub shall
breach any representation or warranty hereunder (without giving  effect to
any materiality or material adverse effect qualifications) and  such breach

would entitle the Company not to consummate the transactions  contemplated
hereby under Section 7.3(a). The foregoing notwithstanding, if  in the case
of clauses (ii) or (iii), the breach giving rise to the right  of termination
is capable of being cured, the Company may not exercise its  right of
termination with respect to such breach unless within ten days  after written
notice of such breach to Parent from the Company, such breach  shall not have
been cured in all material respects or waived by the Company  and Parent or
Sub, as the case may be, shall not have provided reasonable  assurance to the
Company, in the reasonable discretion of the Company, that  such breach will
be cured in all material respects on or before the  Effective Time; or  
(h) By the Company if, in compliance with its obligations under  Sections 6.5
and 6.9, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have  withdrawn or
shall have modified in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub its  approval or
recommendation of the Plan of Merger or this Agreement and (ii)  the Company
shall have entered into an Acquisition Agreement with respect  to a Superior
Proposal.   SECTION 8.2. Effect of Termination.   (a) If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 8.1, this  Agreement shall forthwith be
terminated and have no further effect, except  as specifically provided in
this Section 8.2 and in Sections 9.10 and 9.11,  there shall be no liability
on the part of any party hereto, provided that  nothing herein shall relieve
any party from liability for any willful  breach hereof.   (b) If (i)

8.1(d) or (ii) the Company exercises its right to  terminate this Agreement
under Section 8.1(h), the Company shall pay to  Parent within five business
days of Parent\'s demand thereof, the sum of (A)  all reasonable documented

damages and not  as a penalty, to reimburse Parent for its time, expense and
lost  opportunity costs of pursuing the Merger.   (d) Notwithstanding

Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided, however,
that after approval of the Plan of Merger by the Company Shareholders, no
amendment may be made without the further approval of the
Company Shareholders if the effect of such amendment would be to reduce the
Merger Consideration or change the form thereof or if otherwise required by
the VSCA.   SECTION 8.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
whether before or after the Shareholders\' Meeting, any party hereto, by

performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other
party hereto or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties
or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any
other party or with any conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party
by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to
assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time.   ARTICLE IX.   GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 9.1. No Third Party
Beneficiaries. Other than the provisions of Section 6.7 hereof, nothing in

the parties hereto.   SECTION 9.2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire Agreement among the parties

hereby agree that for purposes of this Agreement (including, but not limited
to conditions to Closing) neither party has made to the other any
representations, warranties or covenants or other disclosures other than
those contained in this Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter. No
amendment, modification or alteration of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement or the   39   Company Disclosure Letter shall be binding unless
the same shall be in writing and duly executed by the parties hereto.  
SECTION 9.3. Succession and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their
respective successors. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties; provided, however, that Sub may freely assign
its rights to another wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without such prior
written approval but no such assignment shall relieve Sub or Parent of any of
its respective obligations hereunder.   SECTION 9.4. Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the

Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflicts of Law thereof.   SECTION 9.7. Severability. Any
term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.   SECTION
9.8. Specific Performance. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties
agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any action instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof
having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter, in addition to any other
remedy to which it may be entitled, at Law or in equity.   SECTION 9.9.
Construction. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no
rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the

shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."   SECTION
