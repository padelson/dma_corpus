NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein, and intending to
be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.01 The Merger. On and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein,
and in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company, with (i) the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub thereupon ceasing and (ii) the Company surviving the
Merger as a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of 

Buyer (the Company, as the surviving corporation after the Effective Time, is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation").

1.02 Filing of Merger Certificate; Effective Time. At the Closing, subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions specified in Article VII, (i) the
Company will execute a certificate of merger in substantially the form of
Exhibit B (the "Certificate of Merger") in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and (ii) the Company and Merger Sub will, and Buyer
will cause Merger Sub to, cause such executed Certificate of Merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
the DGCL, and the Merger will be effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or
at such later time as may be agreed in writing by Buyer and the Company and
specified therein (the "Effective Time").



1.03 Effect of the Merger; Further Assurances



(a)The Merger will have the effects provided in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation determines that any
further documents or acts are necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation
the title to any properties, rights, privileges, powers or franchises of the
Constituent Corporations acquired in the Merger or to otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its officers and
directors will execute and deliver all such documents and do all such acts,
and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of the Constituent Corporations or otherwise to take
any and all such action after the Effective Time solely for the purposes set
forth in this Section 1.03.



(b)Subject to compliance with Section 6.05(a), at the Effective Time the
certificate of incorporation of the Company will, by operation of Law and
without any further action by any Person, be amended and restated as set forth
on Exhibit C, and as so amended and restated will be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended or
repealed in accordance with the provisions thereof, and applicable Law.



(c)Subject to compliance with Section 6.05(a), at the Effective Time, the
bylaws of the Company will, by operation of Law and without any further action
by any Person, be amended and restated in its entirety to contain the
provisions set forth in the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (except for any references to the name of Merger
Sub), and as so amended and restated will be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended or repealed in accordance with the
provisions thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, and applicable Law.



(d)The directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified in the manner provided in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their
earlier resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law. 



(e)The officers of the Company in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors
are duly elected and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, their earlier
resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by applicable Law.



(f)In furtherance of the foregoing, unless prior to the Closing Buyer delivers
a written notice to the Company instructing otherwise, the Company shall take
all necessary action to cause a written letter of resignation to be obtained
from each of the directors of the Company, which resignation shall be
conditioned upon, and effective as of, the Effective Time.



1.04 Conversion of Shares; Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the securities described below:



(a)Each share of the common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one (1) validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(b)Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock cancelled pursuant to
Section 1.04(c) and Dissenting Shares) will be converted into the right to
receive the Closing Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration plus any
amount payable with respect to such share of Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.08, as applicable, and will automatically be cancelled and retired and will
cease to exist.



(c)Each share of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each
share of Common Stock owned or held, directly or indirectly, by the Company,
Buyer, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist without any conversion thereof and no payment of cash or any other
consideration will be made with respect thereto.



(d)Each unexercised Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that becomes either a Vested Option at the Closing or is deemed to be a Vested
Option following the Closing (in accordance with the terms of Section 1.08 and
the Option Plan) will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into the right
to receive the Closing Option Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 1.06 plus any amount payable with respect to such Option pursuant
to Section 1.08 (as applicable), in each case, subject to any applicable Tax
withholding pursuant to Section 1.10, and will automatically be cancelled and
retired and will cease to exist. Each Option that does not otherwise become a
Vested Option as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence shall be
cancelled and retired and cease to exist effective as of the Effective Time,
with no consideration therefor. The amount of cash each Optionholder is
entitled to receive with respect to his or her Vested Options shall be rounded
down to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all
Options held by such Optionholder. Prior to receiving any payment pursuant to
this Section 1.04(d), each Optionholder shall execute an option cancellation
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the "Option Cancellation
Agreement").







1.05 Pre-Closing Merger Consideration Estimate



(a)At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will
prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) an estimated unaudited balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the
"Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a statement (the "Estimated
Closing Statement") setting forth a calculation of (1) the estimated Closing
Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Closing Net Working Capital"), (2) the
estimated Closing Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (3) the estimated
Closing Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), (4) the estimated
Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Transaction Expenses"), (5) the Company's
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration derived from the foregoing,
(6) the Closing Stock Payment payable at the Closing to each Stockholder in
accordance with Section 1.05(b), and (7) the Closing Option Payment payable at
the Closing to each Optionholder in accordance with Section 1.05(c). The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement will be
prepared, and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing
Cash, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction
Expenses will be determined, in each case, in good faith, on a consolidated
basis in accordance with the definitions set forth in this Agreement, and,
with respect to the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital,
using the same accounting methods, assumptions, policies, principles,
practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the Latest Audited
Balance Sheet, except, in the case of Net Working Capital, as adjusted in the
manner set forth (including with reference to the accounts and contractual
adjustments specified) on Exhibit E. Following the delivery of the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Closing Statement, the Company shall
provide the Buyer and its accountants with reasonable supporting documentation
for the calculations included therein and make the relevant books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably available to the
Buyer and its accountants in connection therewith and consider in good faith
any comments or proposed modifications from Buyer with respect to such amounts
and calculations; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company
is unwilling in good faith to accept any such comments or modifications, then
the amounts and estimates set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
the Estimated Closing Statement will be used for Closing (including the
payments to be made at Closing pursuant to Section 1.06).



(b)The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Stockholder will be
entitled to receive at the Closing to be set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement (the "Closing Stock Payment") will equal the product of (i) Closing
Common Stock Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time which were converted in accordance with Section 1.04(b).
Buyer's sole obligation with respect to any such payment is to make the
payment to the Paying Agent contemplated by Section 1.06(a). The Closing Stock
Payment for each Stockholder shall be determined by the Representative, and
none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates will have
any liability or obligation to any Stockholder, any Optionholder, the
Representative or any other Person for payments made or not made in accordance
with instructions from the Representative. 



(c)The portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration each Optionholder will be
entitled to receive at the Closing in respect of his or her Options converted
in accordance with Section 1.04(d) to be set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement (the "Closing Option Payment") will equal the product of (i) Closing
Option Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Common Stock corresponding to such Optionholder's Vested Option at the
Effective Time, based on the Estimated Merger Consideration. Buyer's sole
obligation with respect to any such payment is to make the payment to the
Surviving Corporation contemplated by Section 1.06(b) and to cause the
Surviving Corporation to make the aggregate payments to Optionholders
contemplated by Section 1.06(b). The Closing Option Payment for each
Optionholder shall be determined by the Representative (except that any
withholding Tax amounts applicable to such payments shall be determined by the
Surviving Corporation), and none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates will have any liability or obligation to any Stockholder, any
Optionholder, the Representative or any other Person for payments made or not
made in accordance with instructions from the Representative (except that the
Surviving Corporation will be liable for determining and withholding any Taxes
applicable to payments to Optionholders).



(d)From the Adjustment Calculation Time and until the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any
dividend or distributions of Cash or use any Cash to pay any Transaction
Expenses or to repay any Indebtedness. If, as a result of a breach by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its covenants contained in this Section
1.05(d), Cash shall have changed between the Adjustment Calculation Time and
the Effective Time, then, without limiting any remedy otherwise available to
Buyer, any such changes shall be included in the calculation of Cash for
purposes of the Closing Statement.



1.06 Closing Payment



(a)At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deposit with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Closing Stock Payments payable to the Stockholders
as set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Paying Agent no
later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



(b)At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver the
aggregate Closing Option Payments payable to the Optionholders as set forth in
the Estimated Closing Statement by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Company at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date. The Company will distribute to the Optionholders,
no later than the next scheduled payroll of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
their respective Closing Option Payments, subject to any applicable Tax
withholding pursuant to Section 1.10. After the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make timely payment to the appropriate taxing
authority or authorities of any amounts withheld from payment to the
Optionholders under this Section 1.06.



(c)At the Closing, Buyer will, or will cause Merger Sub to, deliver the Escrow
Deposit Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a separate escrow account designated by the Escrow Agent no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "Escrow Account")
and established pursuant to the terms of the



Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Account will be maintained separately in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.



(d)At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, to the
Representative, the Representative Holdback Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Representative at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



(e)At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all Estimated Transaction Expenses to
such Persons as they are owed by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to accounts designated by the Company at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain
"paid in full" invoices (evidencing the amounts owed to such Persons) from all
Persons set forth in clause (a) of the definition of Transaction Expenses
receiving any such payment.



(f)At the Closing, Buyer will pay, or will cause Merger Sub to pay, on behalf
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all amounts required to be paid under the
Payoff Letters delivered pursuant to Section 5.08 in order to fully discharge
the Indebtedness owed to the Persons thereunder, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts designated in such Payoff Letters.



(g)In accordance with the paying agent agreement to be dated as of the Closing
Date and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Paying
Agent Agreement"), the Paying Agent will act as the Representative's agent in
delivering to each Stockholder its respective Closing Stock Payment in return
for the Certificates which, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Common Stock (other than shares of Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section
1.04(c) and Dissenting Shares), as well as any amounts owed to such
Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.08. At or after the Effective Time, upon
surrender of Certificates and delivery by a Stockholder of a duly executed
letter of transmittal substantially in the form of Exhibit G (the "Letter of
Transmittal") to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will pay each such
Stockholder the Closing Stock Payment to which such Stockholder is entitled
under Section 1.05. The Stock Consideration payable to a Stockholder will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
in writing by such Stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal, unless
alternative arrangements are specified by such holder in the Letter of
Transmittal, to the extent permitted by the Letter of Transmittal. Each such
Stockholder that makes the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by this
Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the Paying Agent Agreement at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date will be paid his, her or its
Closing Stock Payment on the same Business Day as the Effective Time. Each
such Stockholder that makes the deliveries to the Paying Agent required by
this Agreement, the Letter of Transmittal and the Paying Agent Agreement
thereafter will be paid his, her or its Closing Stock Payment as soon as
possible after delivery thereof is made (but in any event no later than three
(3) Business Days after the date such delivery thereof is made).



(h)If any Certificate has been or is claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
that a Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and Buyer) and, if required by the
Paying



Agent or Buyer, the delivery of such indemnity by such Person, as is
reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent and Buyer, the Paying Agent will
deliver to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate or instrument representing shares of Common Stock the proper
amount of the Stock Consideration to which they are entitled hereunder,
subject to the other deliveries required by this Section 1.06.



(i)At any time that is more than six (6) months after the Effective Time,
Buyer may cause the Paying Agent to pay over to the Surviving Corporation any
portion of the Stock Consideration (including any earnings thereon) that had
been delivered to the Paying Agent and that has not been disbursed to
Stockholders as of such six (6) month anniversary (other than any amounts then
subject to dispute). After the Paying Agent makes such payments to the
Surviving Corporation, all former Stockholders will be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation (subject to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the cash payable upon surrender of their Certificates pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Paying Agent will have no further obligation under this
Section 1.06 in its capacity as such. None of the Surviving Corporation,
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Representative or the Paying Agent will be liable to
any Person in respect of amounts paid to a public official to the extent
required under any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(j)At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and no further registration of transfers of shares shall thereafter be
made on the books and records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates representing shares of Common Stock are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, they will be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this Section 1.06.



1.07 Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment. Following the Closing Date,
the Merger Consideration will be adjusted, if at all, dollar-for-dollar as set
forth below:



(a) Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Representative within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the Adjustment Calculation Time (the "Closing Balance
Sheet") and (ii) a statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth a
calculation of (1) Closing Net Working Capital, (2) Closing Cash, (3) Closing
Indebtedness, (4) the Transaction Expenses, (5) Buyer's calculation of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration derived from the foregoing, and (6) with respect
to each of the foregoing, the changes in such amounts from the corresponding
amounts on the Estimated Closing Statement. The Closing Balance Sheet and
Closing Statement will be prepared, and Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses will be determined, in
each case, in good faith, on a consolidated basis in accordance with the
definitions set forth in this Agreement, and, with respect to the Closing
Balance Sheet and Net Working Capital, using the same accounting methods,
assumptions, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent
classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the
preparation of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet, except, in the case of Net
Working Capital, as adjusted in the manner set forth (including with reference
to the accounts and contractual adjustments specified) on Exhibit E. The
Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement will not include any changes in
assets or liabilities as a result of purchase or other accounting adjustments
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the Transactions. The 

parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement and calculating Final Adjusted Merger Consideration is to
(x) accurately measure the amount of Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Transaction Expenses and (y) measure the
difference in Closing Net Working Capital from Target Net Working Capital, and
such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
reserves classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
calculating Final Adjusted Merger Consideration than were used in the
calculation of Estimated Merger Consideration.



(b)On or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day following Buyer's delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, the Representative may give
Buyer a written notice stating in reasonable detail the Representative's
proposed adjustments, if any, to the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement (a "Notice of Disagreement"). During such 45-day period and any
period of dispute thereafter with respect to such Closing Balance Sheet and/or
Closing Statement, Buyer will, and will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, (i) provide the Representative and its Advisors reasonable access to the
relevant books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents), supporting data, and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including Company personnel responsible for accounting and finance and the
Company's senior management) in connection with the Representative's review of
the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Statement, and (ii) otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Representative and its Advisors in connection with such
review. Any determination set forth on the Closing Statement (including the
resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses) that is not specifically objected to in the Notice of
Disagreement will be deemed acceptable to the Representative, and will be
final and binding upon all parties upon delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement. If the Representative does not deliver to Buyer a Notice of
Disagreement within such 45-day period, then the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (including the resulting Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses) will be final and
binding upon the parties as of the expiration of such 45-day period, and the
Adjusted Merger Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement will
constitute the Adjusted Merger Consideration for all purposes of this Section
1.07.

(c)Following Buyer's receipt of any Notice of Disagreement, the Representative
and Buyer will attempt to resolve disputed matters set forth therein, and all
such discussions and negotiations related thereto shall (unless otherwise
agreed by Buyer and the Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and any
applicable similar state rule. In the event that the Representative and Buyer
fail to agree on any of the Representative's proposed adjustments set forth in
the Notice of Disagreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer receives the
Notice of Disagreement, the Representative and Buyer agree to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause KPMG LLP (the "Firm") to make the
final written determination of all matters included in the Notice of
Disagreement that remain in dispute; provided, however, that if KPMG LLP is
unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Representative and Buyer
shall jointly select an alternative Firm that is an independent and impartial,
nationally-recognized independent accounting or valuation firm, within forty-
five (45) days immediately following such first 30-day period; further,
provided, however, that if the Representative and Buyer are unable or
unwilling to jointly select an alternative Firm within that timeframe
(including if the Representative resigns



and is not timely replaced) then the Firm shall be an independent and
impartial, nationally-recognized independent accounting or valuation firm
selected by the American Arbitration Association. Buyer and the Representative
will instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make a final determination of
the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement
(including the resulting Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses), to the extent any such amounts are in
dispute, solely in accordance with this Agreement. Buyer and the
Representative will execute a customary engagement letter, and will cooperate,
with the Firm during the term of its engagement. Buyer and the Representative
will instruct the Firm not to, and the Firm will not, assign a value to any
item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other hand, or less than
the smallest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and the Representative will also
instruct the Firm to, and the Firm will, make its determination based solely
on written submissions by Buyer and the Representative that are in accordance
with this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (including the resulting
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses), in each case, as determined by the Firm in accordance
with this Section 1.07(c), will be final and binding on the parties on the
date the Firm delivers its final determination in writing to Buyer and the
Representative. The latest date on which the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Statement (including the resulting Closing Net Working Capital,
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses) are deemed final
pursuant to Section 1.07(b), are agreed upon by Buyer and the Representative
pursuant to this Section 1.07(c) or are determined by the Firm in accordance
with this Section 1.07(c) is referred to as the "Settlement Date." The fees,
costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one
hand, and Representative, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally determined by the Firm)
bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted. For example, if the
Representative submits a Notice of Disagreement for $1,000, and if Buyer
contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Representative, and if the
Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Representative $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated
sixty percent (60%) (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and forty percent (40%) (i.e.,
200/500) to the Representative.



(d)If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Adjusted Merger
Consideration (such excess, the "Excess Amount"), Buyer and the Representative
will deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer (or its designee), within five (5) Business Days
after the Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Excess Amount from the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer may elect to exclude any "Indebtedness" pursuant to
clause (m) of the definition of "Indebtedness" from the Excess Amount and
pursue recovery of any amount so excluded pursuant to Section 6.08(p) or
Section 10.02(vii).



(e)If the Adjusted Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration (such excess, the "Adjustment Amount"), then Buyer will, within
five (5) Business Days after the Settlement Date, make payment of the
Adjustment Amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds, to the
Paying Agent, with such amounts received



pursuant to this Section 1.07(e), subject to Section 11.19(b), to be paid to
the Stockholders or Optionholders in accordance with Section 1.08.

(f)The parties hereto agree that any payment made pursuant to this Section
1.07 shall be treated as an adjustment to the aggregate consideration for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.



1.08 Certain Payments After the Effective Time. Within ten (10) Business Days
of the receipt of any Additional Merger Consideration, the Representative will
in good faith compute or re-compute, as the case may be, (i) the number of
Vested Options, (ii) the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares, (iii) the
Aggregate Option Exercise Price, (iv) the Final Adjusted Merger Consideration,
(v) the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration, (vi) the Final Common Stock
Per Share Merger Consideration, (vii) the Final Option Per Share Merger
Consideration and (viii) the appropriate amount payable to each Stockholder
and Optionholder based on the foregoing from the Additional Merger
Consideration taking into account any amounts previously received by such
Stockholders and Optionholders in accordance with this Agreement and the terms
of the Option Plan (except that any withholding Tax amounts applicable to such
payments shall be determined by the Surviving Corporation). Promptly
thereafter, the Representative will notify the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation of such calculations and the amount that should be distributed to
each Stockholder and to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of each
Optionholder based upon the calculations and re-calculations contemplated by
the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Stockholder and Optionholder will receive the difference between (x) the
amounts payable to such Stockholder or Optionholder based upon the
calculations and re-calculations contemplated by this Section 1.08 and (y) the
Closing Stock Payment or Closing Option Payment received by such Stockholder
or Optionholder, as applicable. The Representative, the Surviving Corporation
(solely to the extent of funds made available to it for such purpose by the
Representative or the Paying Agent) and the Paying Agent, as applicable, will
distribute such amounts, as applicable, in accordance with the irrevocable
written instructions so received from the Representative (except that any
withholding Tax amounts applicable to such payments shall be determined by the
Surviving Corporation). None of the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent, the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer or any of their Affiliates will have any
liability or obligation to any Stockholder, Optionholder, the Representative
or any other Person for any distribution made or not made in accordance with
the instructions of the Representative pursuant to this Section 1.08 (except
that the Surviving Corporation will be liable for determining and withholding
any Taxes applicable to payments to Optionholders). The parties hereto agree
that any payment made pursuant to this Section 1.08 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the aggregate consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, solely with regard to distributions of Additional Merger Consideration
remitted to the Surviving Corporation for payment to Optionholders, other than
the last distribution to be made pursuant to this Section 1.08, no
distribution shall be made by the Surviving Corporation to such Optionholders
pursuant to this Section 1.08 unless the aggregate amount to be distributed
exceeds $50,000 (provided that the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
hold any such amounts so retained for the benefit of the Optionholders and
distribute such amounts promptly upon reaching such threshold for
distribution). 



1.09 Appraisal Rights. Each share of Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person
who, in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, (i) has not voted in favor of
the Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed an enforceable waiver
of appraisal rights (whether before or after the date of this Agreement) and
(ii) has properly demanded appraisal of such share of Common Stock, and not
effectively withdrawn, lost or failed to perfect their rights to appraisal,
will not, at the Effective Time, be converted into the right to receive any
portion of the Stock Consideration and instead will be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist and shall represent only the right to receive payment
from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto as provided by the DGCL,
unless and until the holder of any such share has failed to perfect or has
effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, in which case such share will thereupon be deemed, as of the
Effective Time, to have been cancelled and retired and to have ceased to exist
and been converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Article I, without interest, in accordance with
this Agreement, the Stock Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, no
Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote his,
her or its shares of Common Stock for any purpose or to receive payment of
dividends or other distributions on his, her or its shares (except dividends
or other distributions payable to Stockholders of record at a date prior to
the Effective Time). Any shares of Common Stock for which appraisal rights
have been properly exercised, and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or failed
to be perfected, in each case, in accordance with this Section 1.09 and the
DGCL, are referred to in this Agreement as "Dissenting Shares." The Company
will give Buyer prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, including any Stockholder's notice of their intent to demand payment
pursuant to the DGCL that the Company receives, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company. Buyer will have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands; provided, that the Company shall
direct all such negotiations and proceedings. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent, as long as the
consideration that would otherwise be payable hereunder with respect to
Dissenting Shares (assuming such shares were not Dissenting Shares) is not
more than three percent (3%) of the Estimated Merger Consideration (or if not
yet available, Buyer's good faith estimate thereof), shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of settle or offer to settle any such demand.



1.10 Withholding Rights. Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent and
the Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, and any other amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as such party is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of
applicable Law relating to Taxes, including (a) such amounts that are required
to be deducted and withheld pursuant to any provision of Tax Law related to or
regarding Taxes with respect to the Options, (b) U.S. federal backup
withholding Taxes required under Code Section 3406 to the extent a Stockholder
does not deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer or the Paying Agent a
properly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or Form W-8, as applicable
or (c) U.S. federal withholding Taxes required under Code Section 1445 to the
extent the Company does not deliver to Buyer the certificate required under
Section 2.02(c)(ii). To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted in full to the applicable Tax authority by Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such



withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. In the event that Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent or
the Escrow Agent determines that withholding from the Merger Consideration is
required under applicable Tax Law and permitted under this Agreement (other
than withholding with respect to Options), Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent will so notify the Representative, on behalf
of the recipient of such payment, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date or any subsequent date that the applicable payment is to be made
to provide such recipient with the opportunity to provide any form or
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding. If
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent withholds
any amount from any Stockholder or Optionholder that such Stockholder or
Optionholder asserts was not required to be withheld, Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, will (provided
that such demand is made prior to remittance of such amounts to the applicable
Tax authority) promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after
demand therefor (including wire transfer information, as applicable), unless
Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as
applicable, disputes in good faith the assertion that such withholding was not
required, remit to such Stockholder or Optionholder the amount wrongly
withheld.

the Benefit Plans by the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan, and,
when applicable, the Laws of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Benefit
Plan is maintained, have been timely made or will be made by the Closing Date,
and all such material contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan, and all

statements; (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all applicable reporting and notice requirements, and

compliance with the Laws of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations
are required in order to give effect to such Foreign Benefit Plan; (iv) such
Foreign Benefit Plan has been administered at all times in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Laws; (v) there are no

Plan at any time for any reason in accordance with the terms of each such
Foreign Benefit Plan without the payment of any material fees, costs or
expenses (other than the payment of benefits accrued on the applicable balance
sheet and any normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred in a
termination event). No Foreign Benefit Plan has unfunded material Liabilities
that will not be offset by insurance or that are not fully accrued on the
applicable financial statements. Each Foreign Benefit Plan that is intended to
qualify for tax-preferential treatment under applicable Laws so qualifies and
has received, where required, approval from the applicable Governmental Body
that it is so qualified and no event has occurred or circumstance exists that

preferential 

treatment, in each case, except as would not result in material liability to
the Company or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

not result in the following) (excluding any agreement contract, arrangement or
plan entered into by, or at the direction of, Buyer or its Affiliates): (i)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits, or increase the
benefits or the amount of compensation payable under any Benefit Plan, (ii)
trigger any funding obligation under any Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.280G-1) that would constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

to protect the confidentiality of the Transactions, and (c) nothing herein
shall require the Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information
to, Buyer or any of its representatives if such access or disclosure (x) would
waive any legal privilege or (y) would be in violation of applicable Laws or
the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; provided that in each such case, the Company shall
cooperate to enable Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and
Advisors to enter into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar
documents or arrangements so that Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates and Advisors may have access to such information. The information
provided pursuant to this Section 5.02 will be governed by all the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.



5.03 Regulatory Filings. Subject to Section 9.03, the Company will, and will
use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates and Advisors to, (a) make
or cause to be made all filings with and submissions to any Governmental Body
required under any applicable Laws for the consummation of the Transactions,
(b) coordinate and cooperate with Buyer and Merger Sub in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as Buyer and Merger Sub may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and (c) (i) supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any further filings with
any Governmental Body pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or
advisable in connection therewith and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
take all actions necessary to obtain all required clearances. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Company will not make or cause to be made
any material filing or submission to any Governmental Body prior to the
Closing without notifying Buyer in advance, other than, subject to Section
9.03, (i) any filing or submission required by the HSR Act or a Foreign
Filing, (ii) the filing of notification with the FDA pursuant to Paragraph 17
of the Consent Decree and (iii) any filing or submission made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice. Subject to Section 9.03, the
Company and its Affiliates and Advisors will not communicate with any
Governmental Body regarding the Transactions, this Agreement, or any other
matter contemplated hereby without notifying Buyer in advance (other than in
connection with the filing of notification with the FDA pursuant to Paragraph
17 of the Consent Decree).



5.04 Notification. The Company will notify Buyer and Merger Sub of any
material variances from the representations and warranties contained in
Article III that would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set forth
in Section 7.02(a) not to be satisfied reasonably promptly upon discovery
thereof; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.04 will not limit any of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in this Agreement or the remedies available hereunder. 



5.05 Exclusivity. From immediately after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and through the Closing (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII), neither the Company, the Representative
nor their respective Affiliates will, nor shall they authorize or permit any
of their directors, partners, officers, managers, employees, agents or
Advisors to, directly or indirectly, take any action to solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Person (other than
Buyer, Merger Sub and their respective Advisors acting in such capacity)
concerning any merger or recapitalization involving the Company or its
Subsidiaries, sale of the Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, any sale of all or substantially all of the
assets or equity interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries or similar
transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than inventory
sold in the ordinary course of business) (an "Acquisition Transaction"). The
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, and Advisors to, terminate any and all
negotiations or discussions with any third party regarding any proposal
concerning any Acquisition Transaction, including any access to any online or
other datasites. The Company shall request the return or destruction of all
"confidential information" or "evaluation material" (each as defined in the
applicable confidentiality agreements referenced in this sentence) related to
the Company and its Subsidiaries and previously provided by the Company or its
Affiliates or their respective Advisors to such third parties on the terms set
forth in the applicable confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement executed
by the Company or its applicable Affiliates and such third parties.



5.06 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in Section 5.03 and this Section 5.06),
the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries, and Advisors to, use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including using reasonable best efforts to (x) upon Buyer's written request,
make any required notices and seek all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from third parties as are required to be
obtained from or made to parties to contracts or other agreements to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries are a party, (y) cause its conditions to Closing
to be satisfied and for the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and
(z) not take any action designed to prevent the Closing. For purposes of this
Agreement, the "reasonable best efforts" of the Company will not require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Advisors to (A) offer to
grant any accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any
payment, to any third party in connection with seeking its consent to the
Transactions, (B) subject to the Company's compliance with Section 9.03 and
9.04(a), obtain any consent required for the consummation of the Transactions
or (C) provide financing to Buyer or Merger Sub for the consummation of the
Transactions.



5.07 280G Cooperation. The Company will, prior to the Closing Date, use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek to obtain the stockholder approval in
accordance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto such that payments or benefits to be received or
retained by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.280G-1) arising in whole or in part as a result of or in connection
with the Transactions should not be characterized as "excess parachute
payments" under Section 

280G of the Code. Prior to seeking such stockholder approval, the Company will
request waivers from the intended recipients of such payments or benefits
which waivers shall provide that unless such payments or benefits are approved
by the stockholders of the Company to the extent and manner prescribed under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer, such payments or benefits shall not be made; provided that in no event
will this Section 5.07 be construed to require the Company to compel any
Person to waive any existing rights under any contract or agreement that such
Person has with the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and in no event will the
Company be deemed in breach of this Section 5.07 if any such Person refuses to
waive any such rights. The parties acknowledge that this Section 5.07 shall
not apply to any arrangements entered into at the direction of Buyer or its
Affiliates or between Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a
disqualified individual on the other hand (the "Buyer Arrangements"). In the
event that Buyer provides to the Company, no less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, a written description of any Buyer Arrangements,
the Company shall include such description in any materials disclosed to
Stockholders in connection with soliciting approval in accordance with this
Section 5.07; provided, however, that compliance with the remainder of this
Section 5.07 shall be determined as if such Buyer Arrangements had not been
entered into.



5.08 Repayment of Indebtedness. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer a draft copy of a
customary payoff letter (subject to delivery of funds as arranged by the
Buyer) from the Administrative Agent (as defined in the respective Existing
Credit Facilities) under each Existing Credit Facility (each a "Payoff
Letter"), and, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
the Buyer an executed copy of each Payoff Letter to be effective upon the
Closing. Such Payoff Letters shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
deliver all the documents required for the termination of commitments under
each of the Existing Credit Facilities, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing, the repayment in full of all Indebtedness then outstanding thereunder
(using funds arranged by the Buyer) and the release of any Liens and
termination of all guarantees supporting such Existing Credit Facilities
substantially contemporaneously with the Closing Date.



5.09 Separation. Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause the
parties to the separation agreement attached hereto as Exhibit H (the
"Separation Agreement") to execute and deliver such Separation Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby in accordance with its terms
(including by causing any parties to the ancillary agreements attached as
exhibits to such Separation Agreement to execute and deliver such ancillary
agreements) (the execution of all such documents and the consummation of all
such transactions, collectively, the "Separation"). Copies of all documents
executed and delivered in connection with the Separation shall be provided to
Buyer at Closing.



ARTICLE IV



COVENANTS OF BUYER AND MERGER SUB



6.01 Access to Books and Records. From and after the Closing until the seven
(7)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide the Representative (and its Advisors
reasonably requiring such access in light of the 

purposes therefor) with reasonable access, during normal business hours, and
upon reasonable advance notice, to the books and records (for the purpose of
examining and copying) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date and reasonable access, during
normal business hours, and upon reasonable advance notice, to senior
management-level employees of Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Representative, neither Buyer
nor the Surviving Corporation will, or will permit the Surviving Corporation's
Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date,
destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the material books and records
of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the
Closing Date without first offering to surrender to the Representative such
books and records or any portion thereof (at the Representative's cost and
expense) that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
such access shall be permitted to the extent it would (i) jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege or other legal immunity or protection from
disclosure of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries or
(ii) contravene any Law, contract or other obligation of confidentiality;
provided that in each such case, Buyer shall cooperate to enable the
Representative and its Advisors to enter into appropriate confidentiality,
joint defense or similar documents or arrangements so that the Representative
and its Advisors may have access to such information.



6.02 Regulatory Filings. Subject to Section 9.03, Buyer and Merger Sub will,
and will use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Affiliates and
Advisors to, (a) make or cause to be made all filings with and submissions to
any Governmental Body required under any applicable Laws for the consummation
of the Transactions, (b) coordinate and cooperate with the Company in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing, and (c) (i) supply
promptly any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested in connection with such filings, (ii) make any further filings with
any Governmental Body pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper or
advisable in connection therewith and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
take all actions necessary to obtain all required clearances. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and Merger Sub will not make or cause
to be made any material filing or submission to any Governmental Body prior to
the Closing in connection with the Transactions without notifying the Company
in advance, other than, subject to Section 9.03, any filing or submission
required by the HSR Act or a Foreign Filing. Subject to Section 9.03, Buyer,
Merger Sub, and their respective Affiliates and Advisors will not communicate
with any Governmental Body regarding the Transactions, this Agreement, or any
other matter contemplated hereby without notifying the Company in advance.



6.03 Notification. Buyer will notify the Company of: any material variance
from the representations or warranties contained in Article IV that would
reasonably be expected to cause the condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) not
to be satisfied, reasonably promptly upon discovery thereof; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.03 will
not limit any of the representations and warranties of Buyer or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement or the remedies available hereunder.



6.04 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this Section 6.04), Buyer and Merger
Sub will, and will cause their 

respective Affiliates and Advisors to, use their reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including using reasonable
best efforts to (x) make any required notices and obtain all necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from third parties as may be
necessary, (y) cause its conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for the
Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and (z) not take any action
designed to prevent the Closing.



6.05 Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification.



(a)For a period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation will not, and Buyer will not permit the Surviving Corporation to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in such Person's certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or in any agreement, relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of, or advancement of expenses to, any present (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) or former director or officer of the
Company (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") for acts and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time in any manner adverse to any DandO Indemnified Person, and Buyer will cause
the Surviving Corporation to observe and fulfill all such provisions.



(b)At or prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain and fully pay for
irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons and
any other persons covered by the Company's and its Subsidiaries' existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies, as direct beneficiaries with a
claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's
current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or before the Effective Time. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
will not, and will cause their Subsidiaries not to, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect.

(c)In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties, rights or assets to any
Person, then, in each case, the successors and assigns of such Persons or
properties, rights or assets, as the case may be, must expressly assume in
writing and be bound by the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05 as a
condition of succession of assignment.



(d)This Section 6.05 is intended to be for the benefit of each of the DandO
Indemnified Persons and may be enforced by any such DandO Indemnified Person as
if such DandO Indemnified Person were a party to this Agreement. The obligations
of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.05 will not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to
whom this Section 6.05 applies without the consent of such affected Person.



6.06 Facility Closings; Employee Layoffs. For a period of ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation will, and
neither will permit any of 

the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries to, terminate employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in compliance in all material
respects with all requirements of the WARN Act. Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries to,
comply in all material respects with any and all applicable notice or filing
requirements under the WARN Act, and will indemnify and hold harmless the
Seller Parties from any liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or
expenses, arising as a result of or related to, in whole or in part, Buyer's
or the Surviving Corporation's actions or omissions under the WARN Act
occurring on or after the Closing Date.



6.07 Contact with Business Relations . Without limiting the provisions of
Section 5.02, Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge that they are not authorized
to, and agree that they will not, and they will not permit any member of the
Buyer Group to, contact any officer, director, employee, customer, supplier,
distributor, hospital, referral source, lessee, lessor, Stockholder,
Optionholder, lender, noteholder or other material business relation of the
Company or its Subsidiaries before the Closing with respect to the Company,
its Subsidiaries, their businesses and the Transactions, in each case, without
receiving the prior written consent of the Company before each such contact
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit Buyer from contacting its
customers, suppliers and other material business relations in the ordinary
course of business who are also customers, suppliers or business relations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries provided that such contact does not relate to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, this Agreement or the Transactions.



6.08 Tax Matters.

(a)Pre-Closing Tax Returns.



(i)At the sole cost of the Company, the Company shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed (taking into account
applicable extensions of time to file), all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date
(taking into account applicable extensions of time to file). The
Representative shall provide a copy of each such income and material non-
income Tax Return to Buyer at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
filing thereof (taking into account extensions of time to file), in the case
of any income Tax Return, and as soon as reasonably practicable in the case of
any material non-income Tax Return for Buyer's review and comment.



(ii)Buyer shall, at the expense of the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders), with the payment for such expense to be paid
solely out of the Escrow Fund, prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely
file, or cause to be timely filed (taking into account applicable extensions
of time to file), all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date that are required to be filed
within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or such other time as Buyer
is entitled to indemnification in respect of such Tax Returns under Article X
(taking into account the limitations set forth therein)) consistent with the
past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as required by
applicable Law. Buyer shall provide a copy of each such income Tax Return to
the Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing 

thereof (taking into account extensions of time to file) in the case of an
income Tax Return, and as soon as reasonably practicable in the case of a
material non-income Tax Return, for the Representative's review and approval,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any
reasonable comments provided by Representative in good faith to any such Tax
Return shall be reflected in such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof;
provided that, with respect to the preparation of the Tax Returns under this
Section 6.08(a)(ii), such Tax Returns shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, reflect all applicable Transaction Tax Deductions and the
parties agree that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (x) elect to carry
back any net operating losses from the tax period ending on the Closing Date
to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by law (using any
available short-form or accelerated procedures for carrybacks (including
filing IRS Form 1139) and any corresponding form for applicable state, local
and foreign tax purposes) and (y) file amended Tax Returns with respect to
carrybacks to the extent necessary to obtain any potential Tax refunds related
thereto, in each case at the expense of the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders); and provided, further, that if the
Representative withholds approval of a Tax Return, or if any Representative
comment with respect to a Tax Return would increase the Taxes of Buyer, the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates in any taxable period,
(i) Buyer and the Representative shall endeavor in good faith to agree on such
matter in dispute and (ii) if Buyer and the Representative are unable to agree
on any such matters in dispute, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by
Buyer, to the extent consistent with applicable Law, by the due date for
filing thereof (taking into account applicable extensions of time to file),
subject to amendment after such matters in dispute are submitted for
resolution to the Firm, whose decision shall be final and binding upon the
parties. For purposes of this Agreement, including determination of any Tax
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the parties agree to treat (and
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to treat) any gain, income, deductions,
losses, or other items realized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
resulting from any transactions outside the ordinary course of business
consummated at the direction of the Buyer on the Closing Date following the
Closing as occurring on the day after the Closing Date and, if applicable, to
utilize (and cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to utilize) the "next day"
rule in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law) or otherwise apply a closing of the
books methodology as of the Closing for purposes of reporting such items on
Tax Returns for Post-Closing Tax Periods.



(b)Straddle Period Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and timely file, or cause to be timely filed (taking into account applicable
extensions of time to file), all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods that are required to be filed within
twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (or such other time as Buyer is
entitled to indemnification in respect of such Tax Returns under Article X
(taking into account the limitations set forth therein)). The portion of any
such Tax Returns ending on or before the Closing shall be prepared and filed
in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except as required by applicable Law; provided further that,
with respect to the preparation of the Tax Returns under this Section 6.08(b),
such Tax Returns shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, reflect all
applicable Transaction Tax Deductions and the parties agree that the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall (x) elect to carry back any net operating losses
from the tax period ending on the Closing Date to prior taxable years to the
fullest extent permitted by law (using any available short-form or accelerated
procedures for carrybacks (including filing IRS Form 1139) and any
corresponding form for applicable state, 

local and foreign tax purposes) and (y) file amended Tax Returns with respect
to carrybacks to the extent necessary to obtain any potential Tax refunds
related thereto, in each case at the expense of the Representative (on behalf
of the Stockholders and Optionholders). Buyer shall provide the Representative
a copy of each such Tax Return that relates to income Taxes or, in the case of
a material non-income Tax Return, reflects an amount for which Buyer is
entitled to indemnification under Article X (taking into account the
limitations set forth therein) at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for filing thereof (taking into account applicable extensions of time to file)
in the case of an income Tax Return, and as soon as reasonably practicable in
the case of a material non-income Tax Return, for the Representative's (x)
review and approval with respect to the portion of any such Tax Returns ending
on or before the Closing Date which may result in an indemnity obligation
under Article X (taking into account the limitations set forth therein), such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (y)
review and comment with respect to other Tax Returns or portions thereof.
Buyer shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments to the extent such
comments relate to the portion of any such Tax Returns ending on or before the
Closing and are consistent with the past practice of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. If the Representative withholds approval of a Tax Return or
objects to any item on any such Tax Return that would increase the amount for
which Buyer is not entitled to indemnification under Article X (taking into
account the limitations set forth therein), (i) Buyer and the Representative
shall endeavor in good faith to agree on such matter in dispute and (ii) if
Buyer and the Representative are unable to agree on any such matters in
dispute, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Buyer, to the extent
consistent with applicable Law, by the due date for filing thereof (taking
into account applicable extensions of time to file), subject to amendment
after such matters in dispute are submitted for resolution to the Firm, whose
decision shall be final and binding on the parties.



(c)Apportionment of Straddle Period Taxes. The parties shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant Governmental Body to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. To the extent applicable, the parties agree that
the Buyer and its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
make an election under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to
ratably allocate items (or make any equivalent election to ratably allocate
items under any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law).
In any case where applicable Law does not permit the Company to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or period of the Company with
respect to a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of Taxes that
are based upon or measured by income or receipts, be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and
take into account all applicable Transaction Tax Deductions that would be
permitted under applicable Law to be included in a Tax Return governed by
Section 6.08(a)(ii) if the Closing Date was the last day of the taxable year
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and for such purpose, the taxable period
of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries holds an interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time)
and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days from the beginning of such Straddle Period through and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire Straddle Period. 



(d)Deferred Revenue Methodology. For purposes of Sections 6.08(a) \- 6.08(c),
the Representative, the Company and Buyer agree that, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, if the Company's deferred revenue balance is written down
for book accounting purposes via purchase accounting, the Company's Tax
Returns shall reflect recognition in a Pre-Closing Tax Period of such deferred
revenue for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



(e)Pre-Closing Tax Matters. After the Closing, except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.08 or as required by applicable Law, without the prior written
consent of the Representative or Buyer, as applicable, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Representative or Buyer,
as applicable, will not and will not permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) amend or otherwise modify any Tax Return in respect of a
Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any Tax election with respect to,
or that has retroactive effect to, a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) voluntarily
initiate any communication with any Tax authority with respect to any Tax
Return in respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) extend or waive the
statute of limitations for assessments with respect to any Tax Return in
respect of a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Taxes attributable to such Tax period;
provided, however, that (x) the limitations set forth in this Section 6.08(e)
shall not apply to Buyer to the extent the actions by Buyer set forth in
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) would not give rise to an amount for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Article X (taking into account the
limitations set forth therein) and (y) the limitations set forth in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iv) of this Section 6.08(e) shall not apply to the
Representative to the extent such actions by Representative set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) would not increase the Taxes of Buyer, the Company
and its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates in any taxable period for
which Buyer may not be entitled to indemnification under Article X (taking
into account the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be permitted to take all appropriate
actions to reflect proper treatment of unrealized foreign exchange losses on
the Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods,
including amending Tax Returns and changing accounting methods in respect of
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and preparing Tax Returns under Section 6.08(a)(ii)
and Section 6.08(b) to reflect such proper treatment of unrealized foreign
exchange losses, subject to the Representative\'s review and approval rights
relating to such Tax Returns pursuant to Section 6.08(a)(ii) and Section
6.08(b), respectively.



(f)Transfer Taxes. At the Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due
thereafter, all gross receipts, transfer, gains, property, sales, use,
documentary, registration, excise, stamp, and any other similar Taxes and all
applicable conveyance fees, recording charges and other similar fees and
charges applicable to, arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions,
whether imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries or imposed on any holder of
Common Stock or Options (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") resulting from the
Transactions (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, any Transfer Taxes
arising out of or imposed on the Separation, including all agreements and
transactions between the Company and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and West
Affum Holdings Corp. and its Affiliates on the other hand) will be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation and fifty percent (50%) by
the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders). Buyer
will prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the
Representative will cooperate with the Buyer in the preparation and filing of
such Tax Returns. Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate in good faith
to minimize the amount of any Transfer Taxes. 



(g)Tax Contests. If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates
receives notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or
judicial Action involving Taxes (a "Tax Contest") relating to a Tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, then within twenty
(20) days after receipt of such notice, Buyer shall notify the Representative
in writing of such notice. If any such Tax Contest relating to a Tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date could give rise to Taxes for which
Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Article X (taking into account the
limitations set forth therein), the Representative may elect to control such
Tax Contest, at its own expense (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders), by providing Buyer written notice of intent to control such
Tax Contest within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from Buyer. If
the Representative does not provide written notice of intent to control such
Tax Contest within such time period, the Representative shall be deemed to
have elected not to control such Tax Contest. Prior to the Representative
taking control, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary to, control such Tax Contest in good faith. While the
Representative controls any such Tax Contest, the Representative shall (1)
keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest
and consult in good faith with the Buyer with respect to any issue relating to
such Tax Contest, (2) provide Buyer with copies of any correspondence, notices
and other written material received from any Governmental Authority with
respect to such Tax audit or other proceeding, (3) provide the Buyer with a
copy of, and an opportunity to review and comment on, any written submissions
made to a Governmental Authority in connection with such Tax Contest, (4)
allow the Buyer and the Company, at the Buyer's sole cost and expense, to
participate in such Tax Contest; and (5) not settle, resolve, or abandon any
such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Buyer (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Representative
does not elect, or is deemed to not elect, to control such Tax Contest, or
with respect to any Tax Contest relating to a Straddle Period that could give
rise to Taxes for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification under Article X
(taking into account the limitations set forth therein), the Buyer shall
control such Tax Contest and shall (A) keep the Representative reasonably
informed regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (B) not settle, resolve, or
abandon any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the
Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, and in the case of a Tax Contest relating to a Straddle Period, shall
be with respect to the portion of any such Tax Contest ending on or before the
Closing only); and (C) permit the Representative to participate in a Tax
Contest relating to a Straddle Period at the sole cost and expense of the
Representative, such participation to include the right to receive copies of
all correspondence from any Governmental Body with respect to the Tax Contest
and attend meetings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure by Buyer to
provide notice of a Tax Contest shall not affect Buyer's right to
indemnification pursuant to Article X unless the Stockholders are materially
prejudiced thereby.



(h)Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the
Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any other party hereto, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns, any
Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-related claims. Such cooperation will
include providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant
to this Section 6.08(h). The party requesting any such records, information or
employees shall bear all out-of-pocket expenses (including accountants' and
attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement 

for employee salaries) reasonably incurred in connection with providing such
records, information or employees.



(i)Tax Sharing Agreements. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
all Tax sharing, Tax indemnity or Tax allocation agreements or other similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Company or its Subsidiaries
(other than this Agreement and any other agreements or arrangements that are
customary (i) leases, (ii) credit agreements or (iii) other arrangements with
customers or vendors of which Tax is not the principal subject matter) shall
cease and be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
none of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby
or have any liability thereunder.



(j)Powers of Attorney. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date,
the Representative shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer a
written list of all U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. powers of attorney
with respect to Taxes granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Unless otherwise requested in writing by Buyer, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to cancel or otherwise
terminate, on or before the Closing Date, all such powers of attorney with
respect to Taxes granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(k)338 and 336(e) Elections. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their Affiliates will make any election under Sections 338 or 336(e) of the
Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) with respect
to the Transactions.



(l)Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their Affiliates shall take any action that would cause the
Transactions to constitute part of a transaction that is the same as, or
substantially similar to, the "intermediary transaction tax shelter" described
in IRS Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.



(m)Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by the Buyer or the Company
to which the Buyer or the Company or a Subsidiary becomes entitled that relate
to Tax liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries for either (i) a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (including those attributable to the Transaction Tax
Deductions) or (ii) Straddle Periods of the Company or a Subsidiary to the
extent such refunds relate to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period,
will be for the sole account of the Stockholders and Optionholders, except to
the extent such refund resulted from the carryback of any net operating loss
or other tax attribute generated in a Post-Closing Tax Period; provided,
however, that the Stockholders and Optionholders shall not be entitled to any
Tax refunds (x) after the Expiration Date or such other time at which Buyer
becomes no longer entitled to indemnification in respect of such Taxes under
Article X (taking into account the limitations set forth therein) or (y) in
respect of any amounts that were included in the calculation of the Adjusted
Merger Consideration. The Buyer will pay, or cause to be paid, over to the
Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and Optionholders) any such
refunds to which the Stockholders and Optionholders are entitled pursuant to
this Section 6.08(k) within ten (10) days after receipt or entitlement
thereto. Buyer will, (A) upon the written request of the Representative and at
the expense of the Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders and
Optionholders), file Tax Returns, including amended Tax Returns to obtain any
such refunds, (B) take commercially reasonable action requested in writing by
the Representative to obtain any such refunds, and (C) elect, and cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to elect, to receive a Tax 

refund rather than a credit in lieu of a Tax refund with respect to all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods to the extent such election is available under applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.08 does not entitle the
Stockholders or the Optionholders to any Tax refund realized from the
carryforward of net operating losses, credits or other tax items existing
prior to the Closing to any Post-Closing Tax Period.



(n)Subpart F Income. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take or permit
any action or engage in any transaction outside the ordinary course of
business from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time which
could give rise to U.S. income inclusion under Section 951 of the Code with
respect to any Subsidiary that is a "controlled foreign corporation" as
defined in Section 957 of the Code.



(o)Company Ownership. The Representative represents to Buyer and Merger Sub,
as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as set forth on
Schedule 6.08(o).



(p)License Agreement. Reference is made to the Amended and Restated
Intellectual Property License Agreement (the "License Agreement"), to be
entered into by and among PC International, Physio-Control, Inc. and Physio-
Control Manufacturing, Inc. (together, the "Physio-Control Parties") on the
one hand and West Affum Holdings Corp. ("West Affum") on the other hand, and
to the Separation Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Buyer a valuation by Houlihan Lokey or another independent and
impartial accounting or valuation firm chosen by the Company of (a) all
licenses granted by West Affum to the Physio-Control Parties under the License
Agreement and (b) all covenants made by West Affum under Section 5.02 of the
Separation Agreement (collectively, the "Initial License Valuation"), together
with all supporting documentation provided to or received from such firm
related to the Initial License Valuation, in each case, within twenty (20)
days after the date of this Agreement, provided that, in no event shall the
Initial License Valuation be delivered to Buyer later than five (5) days prior
to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Initial License Valuation
shall be performed using the fair market value standard. Buyer shall have ten
(10) days immediately following receipt of the Initial License Valuation to
review and comment on the Initial License Valuation. If Buyer disagrees with
all or any part of the Initial License Valuation, the parties shall attempt in
good faith to resolve such disagreement within five (5) days after the
expiration of Buyer's review and comment period, provided that, if the parties
are unable to reach agreement within five (5) days after the expiration of
Buyer's review and comment period, the matters that remain in dispute shall be
promptly submitted to the Firm to make a final determination of the license
and covenants valuation. The fees, costs and expenses of the Firm shall be
allocated in accordance with the principles of Section 1.07(c). "Final License
Valuation" means the final determination of the license and covenants
valuation by the Firm pursuant to the preceding sentence or, if the parties
reach complete agreement on the license and covenants valuation without
submission to the Firm, such agreed valuation. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer, the Company and the Representative
shall cooperate in good faith to determine the portion, if any, of the prepaid
royalty from the Physio-Control Parties to West Affum pursuant to the License
Agreement and the consideration paid or deemed to be paid by the Company to
West Affum in respect of West Affum's covenants under Section 5.02 of the
Separation Agreement (which prepaid royalty and consideration together equal
an amount equal to the Final License Valuation) that is foreign source income
not 

subject to U.S. federal tax withholding. "Foreign Source Amount" means the
amount of such prepaid royalty and consideration that Buyer, the Company and
the Representative mutually agree is foreign source income not subject to U.S.
federal tax withholding, which amount, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
zero if Buyer, the Company and the Representative do not agree on the amount
that is foreign source income not subject to U.S. federal tax withholding. The
parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine the Final License Valuation
pursuant to this Section 6.08(p) prior to the Closing Date. If the Final
License Valuation is not determined prior to the Closing Date, the parties
shall continue to cooperate in good faith to determine the Final License
Valuation as soon as practicable thereafter; provided that the Final License
Valuation shall in all events be determined prior to the delivery of the
Closing Statement under Section 1.07(a). "License Amount" means (i) if the
Final License Valuation is determined prior to the calculation of Estimated
Closing Indebtedness pursuant to Section 1.05(a), the product of (A) thirty
percent (30%) multiplied by (B) (I) the Final License Valuation minus (II) the
Foreign Source Amount (the product determined under this clause (i), the
"Final License Amount"), or (ii) if the Final License Valuation is not
determined prior to the calculation of Estimated Closing Indebtedness pursuant
to Section 1.05(a), the product of (A) thirty percent (30%) multiplied by
(B)(I) the Initial License Valuation as adjusted to reflect any items the
parties agree upon, minus (II) the Foreign Source Amount (the product
determined under this clause (ii), the "Estimated License Amount"); provided
that, for purposes of preparing the Closing Statement under Section 1.07(a),
"License Amount" shall in all events mean an amount equal to the Final License
Amount plus interest and penalties (to the extent applicable) in respect of
late remittance of any portion of the License Amount through (but not beyond)
the date on which Buyer is required under this Section 6.08(p) to cause such
portion of the License Amount to be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service,
or such earlier date as Buyer actually causes such portion of the License
Amount to be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service. Within ten (10) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be remitted to the Internal
Revenue Service an amount equal to the License Amount that was taken into
account in the calculation of, and reduced, the Estimated Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.05(a). If the License Amount that was included in the
calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration was the Estimated License
Amount, then, within five (5) days after determination of the Final License
Valuation, the Representative shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the sum of
(A) the Final License Amount minus the Estimated License Amount, plus (B)
interest and penalties (to the extent applicable) in respect of late
remittance of any portion of the License Amount through (but not beyond) the
date on which Buyer is required under this Section 6.08(p) to cause such
portion of the License Amount to be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service,
or such earlier date as Buyer actually causes such portion of the License
Amount to be remitted to the Internal Revenue Service (such sum, the "License
Amount Adjustment"). Within five (5) days after receiving the License Amount
Adjustment from the Representative pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Buyer shall cause the License Amount Adjustment to be remitted to the Internal
Revenue Service.



(q)Overlap Provisions. In the event of any conflict or overlap between the
provisions of this Section 6.08 and Article X, the provisions of this Section
6.08 shall control.

Closing has not occurred on or before August 12, 2016 (the "End Date");
provided that (i) no termination may be made under this Section 8.01(b) if the

comply with any of the agreements or covenants hereof to be performed or
complied with prior to the Closing by, the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b) and (ii) if the satisfaction, or

ARTICLE IX



ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND COVENANTS



9.01 [Reserved].



9.02 Employees and Employee Benefits.



(a)Compensation and Benefits. As of the Effective Time and continuing for one
(1) year thereafter, Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide to all employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of immediately following the Closing (the "Retained
Employees") with (i) a base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus
opportunity at least equal to the base salary or wage rate and bonus
opportunity in effect for such Retained Employee immediately before the
Closing, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity compensation and defined
benefit pension benefits but including termination and severance benefits)
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to such benefits in
effect for such Retained Employee immediately before the Closing. Nothing in
this Section 9.02 will obligate Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to continue (and will not prevent Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from modifying or terminating) the
employment of any such Retained Employee. Buyer will be solely responsible for
complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is an "MandA qualified
beneficiary" as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9.



(b)Employee Service Credit. Buyer agrees that each Retained Employee shall, as
of the Effective Time, receive full credit for service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and 

vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual, except that such service
will be counted for purposes of determining PTO and severance benefits) under
the benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements, arrangements and
policies of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any equity or equity-
related awards or other incentive awards granted after the Effective Time and
any defined benefit pension benefits); provided, however, that nothing herein
shall result in the duplication of any benefits for the same period of
service. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the application
of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the extent such
were waived or satisfied under the comparable health or welfare benefit plan
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) cause each
Retained Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such Retained Employee under any similar Benefit Plan for the plan year that
includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the plans maintained by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, as applicable, for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs.



(c)Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize all accrued but
unused PTO for each Retained Employee as of the Closing Date. Further, for the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to credit each Retained Employee with additional PTO in accordance
with the PTO policy applicable to such Retained Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date; provided, unless otherwise prohibited under applicable Law,
each Retained Employee shall be required to use all accrued PTO (whether
accrued prior to the Closing Date or accrued during the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs) no later than the end of the calendar year in which the
Closing occurs (at such times as are approved by the Retained Employee's
direct supervisor). Thereafter, each Retained Employee shall become entitled
to PTO in accordance with the PTO policy of Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation.



(d)The provisions of this Section 9.02 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Retained Employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 9.02 shall
create such rights in any such Persons. Nothing herein shall (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Retained Employee at
any time and for any reason; (ii) subject to compliance with the other
requirements of this Section 9.02, require Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
to continue any Benefit Plans, or other employee benefit plans or arrangements
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; or (iii) amend any Benefit Plans or other employee benefit
plans or arrangements.



9.03 Antitrust Notification.



(a)The Company and the Buyer Parties will, as promptly as practicable and no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, file
with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States
Department of Justice, the 

notification form required pursuant to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which
form will specifically request early termination of the waiting period
prescribed by the HSR Act. Additionally, the Buyer Parties will, as promptly
as practicable following the date of this Agreement, file the required
materials requesting expiration or early termination, as applicable, of the
applicable waiting periods under (A) Brazil's New Competition Law (Federal Law
Nr. 12,529/2011), as amended, (B) the German Act Against Restraints in
Competition (ARC), as amended and (C) the Russian Law on the Protection of
Competition, as amended (collectively, the "Foreign Filings"). Each of the
Company and the Buyer Parties will furnish to each other's counsel such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act or the Foreign Filings and will provide any supplemental
information requested by any Governmental Body as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The Company and the Buyer Parties will use all reasonable best
efforts to comply as promptly as reasonably practicable with any requests made
for any additional information in connection with such filings. Buyer will be
responsible for all filing fees payable in connection with such filings.



(b)The Company and the Buyer Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to
promptly obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation
of the Transactions and will keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Body and will comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request.



(c)The Buyer Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain
any clearance required under the Foreign Filings for the consummation of the
Transactions and will keep the Company apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Body and will comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request.



(d)The parties hereto commit to instruct their respective counsel to cooperate
with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and expedite the
identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR Act and the
Foreign Filings at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best
efforts and cooperation include counsel's undertaking (i) to keep each other
appropriately informed of material communications from and to personnel of the
reviewing Governmental Bodies and (ii) to confer with each other regarding
appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such Governmental
Bodies and the content of any such contacts or presentations. Neither the
Company nor the Buyer Parties will participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Body with respect of any such filings, applications,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of
the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant
Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or discussion (which, at the request of either Buyer or the Company, will be
limited to outside antitrust counsel only). The Company will have the right to
review (subject to appropriate redactions for confidentiality and attorney-
client privilege concerns) and approve the content of any presentations, white
papers or other written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body by
Buyer in advance of any such submission. Buyer will have the right to review
(subject to appropriate redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client
privilege concerns) and approve the content of any presentations, white papers
or other written materials to be submitted to any Governmental Body 

by the Company in advance of any such submission (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, the notification form filed pursuant to Section 9.03(a) by the
Company or its Affiliates).



(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates shall be required to (i) agree to or proffer to sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair
Buyer's or any of its Affiliates' ability to own or operate any assets or
properties of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any equity or other interests in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), (ii) agree to or proffer to sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or impair any material assets or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) take any such
action in connection with any Action by a Person other than a Governmental
Body



9.04 Written Consents; Section 262 Notices.



(a)Promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a
copy of an irrevocable written consent of Stockholders constituting the
Necessary Stockholder Approval, evidencing the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Transactions.



(b)The Company will, in accordance with applicable Law and its organizational
documents, on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date of this
Agreement, mail to any Stockholder that has not theretofore executed a written
consent adopting this Agreement, approving the Transactions and waiving any
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (each, a "Remaining
Stockholder") a request that such Stockholder execute the written consent of
the Company's Stockholders approving the Merger as provided in Section 228 of
the DGCL and that such Stockholder waive any appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL. In connection with such request, the Company will, through
its board of directors, recommend to its Stockholders approval of the Merger.
Approval of this Agreement by the Stockholders of the Company will not
restrict the ability of the Company's board of directors thereafter to
terminate or amend this Agreement to the extent permitted by this Agreement
and not prohibited under Section 251(d) of the DGCL.



(c)As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company will deliver to Buyer, for review and comment, the information
statement or other information to be delivered to the Remaining Stockholders
(the "Information Statement"), and will incorporate therein any reasonable
comments of Buyer and its legal counsel delivered to the Company within three
(3) Business Days after receiving the Information Statement or other
information. The Information Statement or other information will be mailed by
the Company to the Remaining Stockholders not later than ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement. The Company will cause the Information
Statement to contain the notices required pursuant to the DGCL in connection
with the Merger and otherwise comply with all applicable Laws. The Company
will cause the Information Statement to not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 





9.05 Affiliate Contracts. The Company will cause the termination, effective no
later than the Effective Time, of the contracts or arrangements set forth on
Schedule 9.05 without any further cost or Liability to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or, after the Effective Time, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates).



9.06 HeartSine Adjustment Payment. From and after the Adjustment Calculation
Time, as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following receipt by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) of any Excess
Amount (as defined in the HeartSine Merger Agreement) pursuant to Section
2.6(d) of the HeartSine Merger Agreement (any such Excess Amount, a "HeartSine
Adjustment Payment"), Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary
to, pay an amount equal to such HeartSine Adjustment Payment by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Representative for distribution in
accordance with Section 1.08. From and after the Closing, Buyer will have the
right to participate in all negotiations regarding any HeartSine Adjustment
Payment; provided that the Representative shall direct all such negotiations
and proceedings. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) shall, except with the prior
written consent of the Representative, agree to the amount of, settle or offer
to settle any HeartSine Adjustment Payment or related matters. From and after
the Closing, all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the HeartSine Adjustment Payment or
any Action related thereto shall be promptly paid by the Representative.



ARTICLE 10



INDEMNIFICATION



10.01 Survival. All representations and warranties and the covenants and
agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or requires
performance prior to the Closing) of the Company shall terminate and expire
on, and shall cease to have any further force or effect following, the date
which is twelve (12) months from the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date");
provided, however, that if at any time prior to the Expiration Date, Buyer has
duly delivered to the Representative and the Escrow Agent a Notice of
Indemnification Claim (satisfying the requirements set forth in Section
10.08(a)), then the specific Indemnification Claim asserted in such Notice of
Indemnification Claim shall survive the Expiration Date until such time as
such claim is resolved. All representations and warranties and the covenants
and agreements (to the extent such covenant or agreement contemplates or
requires performance prior to the Closing, but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, the payment obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub pursuant to Section
1.06) made by Buyer and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire at the Closing.
Each covenant and agreement requiring performance at or after the Closing,
will, in each case, expressly survive Closing in accordance with its terms,
and if no term is specified, then for twenty (20) years following the
Effective Time.



10.02 Indemnification. Subject to the terms of this Article X, from and after
the Effective Time, Buyer, its Subsidiaries (including the Company from and
after the Effective Time) and Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, stockholders, attorneys, accountants, representatives, agents and
employees and their respective heirs, successors and assigns (each of the
foregoing being referred to individually as an "Indemnified Person" and
collectively as the 

"Indemnified Persons") shall be entitled to be indemnified solely from the
Escrow Fund against any Damages, directly or indirectly, arising out of or
resulting from (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III of this Agreement (it being
understood that for purposes of this Section 10.02(i) such representations
shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing (except that any representation or warranty that speaks as of the
date of this Agreement or any other date shall only be deemed to have been
made as of such date)), without giving effect to any "Material Adverse
Effect," "materiality" and other qualifications using the terms "in any
material respect" or "in all material respects" or similar materiality
qualifiers, (ii) any breach of any of the covenants of the Company set forth
in this Agreement required to be performed prior to or at the Closing (but
only to the extent such breach occurred prior to the Closing), (iii) the
excess, if any, of the aggregate amount ultimately required to be paid to
holders of Dissenting Shares with respect thereto by the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to appraisal rights or dissenters' rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL over the aggregate amount such holders would have otherwise received as
Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares, plus any
reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Persons as a result of the
investigation or defense of such appraisal or dissenters' claims, (iv) any
Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness that were not paid on or prior to the
Closing Date or taken into account in the calculation of the Adjusted Merger
Consideration, (v) any Action of any Stockholder or purported Stockholder of
the Company (in each case, in their capacities as such) relating to the
allocation or entitlement to a portion of the Merger Consideration paid in
consummating the Transactions, or any other matter relating to the
Transactions, including any such claims under any purported contractual,
employment or other rights that assert entitlement to any security of the
Company or any portion of the Merger Consideration, other than any claims
relating to Buyer's failure to pay any portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement, (vi) (A) any non-income Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries that
are attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, but only to the extent such Taxes
(and in such amounts) were not taken into account in the calculation of the
Adjusted Merger Consideration, and (B) any income Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries that
are attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods but only to the extent such Taxes
(and in such amounts) were not taken into account under clause (k) of the
definition of Indebtedness as determined pursuant to this Agreement, (vii) the
License Amount Adjustment, but only to the extent such amount was not taken
into account in the calculation of the Adjusted Merger Consideration, paid by
the Representative pursuant to Section 6.08(p) or included in the Excess
Amount and (viii) the item set forth on Schedule 10.02. For purposes of this
Article X, "Damages" means all losses, Liabilities, damages, costs, Taxes and
expenses, including interest expense (including pre-judgment interest), costs
of investigation and defense and reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers,
experts and other professionals, including in connection with investigating
and seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article X. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or
knowing and intentional misrepresentation with respect to the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III, in no event shall any Indemnified
Person be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for Damages
relating to or arising out of (x) any recall of a Product or any Order by a
Governmental Body requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to stop
shipment of any Product, including if any recall or stop shipment results
from, or the facts and circumstances giving rise to such recall or stop
shipment constitute, a breach of any of the representations or warranties of
the 

Company made in this Agreement, or (y) any breach of the representation and
warranty contained in the penultimate sentence of Section 3.13(g) relating to
Products of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are not yet released as of
the date of this Agreement unless, and only to the extent, in the case of this
clause (y) only, such Damages arise out of a Third-Party Claim.



10.03 Certain Limitations. No indemnification under Section 10.02(i) shall be
available unless and until the aggregate Damages of the Indemnified Persons
under such section exceed the Indemnification Deductible, in which case,
indemnification under such section shall, subject to the other limitations set
forth in this Agreement, be available for all Damages in excess of the
Indemnification Deductible; provided, however, that the Indemnification
Deductible shall not apply to Damages arising from (i) claims based on fraud
or knowing and intentional misrepresentation or (ii) breaches of a Fundamental
Representation. Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnified Persons will
not be entitled to indemnification under Section 10.02(i), and no such claim
by such Indemnified Persons will be so asserted, where the Damages relating to
or resulting from such claim or other claims relating to or resulting from the
same facts, events or circumstances are less than $25,000. No Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article X for punitive
damages (except to the extent awarded to a third party in any Third-Party
Claim). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no Indemnified Person shall have any right to indemnification hereunder with
respect to any Damage (i) to the extent such Damage was expressly and
specifically included as a liability or reserve on the Closing Statement or
Closing Balance Sheet or was otherwise included in the calculation of the
Merger Consideration and resulted in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the
Merger Consideration, provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not limit any claim for Damages to the extent the Indemnified
Person is not fully compensated for all Damages directly or indirectly arising
out of or resulting from the claim giving rise to such Damages by a dollar-
for-dollar reduction in the Merger Consideration, (ii) attributable to taxable
periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date other than
Damages relating to the breach of representations in Section 3.10(c), Section
3.10(e) or Section 3.10(n) or (iii) due to the unavailability in any taxable
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating loss, credits or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date.



10.04 Defense of Third-Party Claims. Promptly after an Indemnified Person
receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of any actual or possible
Action that has been or may be brought, commenced or asserted by an
unaffiliated third party against an Indemnified Person and that may give rise
to an Indemnification Claim under this Article X (any such actual or possible
claim, demand or Action by a third party being referred to as a "Third-Party
Claim"), Buyer shall deliver to the Representative a written notice stating in
reasonable detail the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim, the basis of
the claim for indemnification with respect thereto and (to the extent then
known or reasonably ascertainable) the amount of Damages related thereto;
provided, however, that a delay in so notifying the Representative shall not
result in any Indemnified Person losing its rights to indemnification pursuant
to this Article X except to the extent the Representative demonstrates that
the defense of such Third-Party Claim is actually and materially prejudiced
thereby. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of a Third-Party
Claim, the Representative may, upon written acknowledgment without
qualification of the right of the Indemnified Person to be indemnified,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, for all Damages
arising out of or resulting from such Third-Party Claim, be entitled 

to assume the defense of such action and to appoint counsel of the
Representative's choice at the expense of the Representative to represent the
Indemnified Person; provided, however, that such counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Person. If the Representative so elects to
assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim, then:



(a)Buyer shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such defense,
but Buyer shall not be entitled to be indemnified for any costs or expenses
incurred by Buyer in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim
following the Representative's election to so assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, and neither Buyer nor any Indemnified Person shall enter
into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned);



(b)Buyer shall make available to the Representative all books, records and
other documents and materials that are under the direct or indirect control of
the Surviving Corporation that the Representative may reasonably request in
connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim and shall otherwise
cooperate as reasonably requested by the Representative in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim; and

(c)the Representative shall not enter into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).



If the Representative does not so assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to conduct and control the defense of
such Third-Party Claim; provided that the Indemnified Person shall not enter
into any settlement of such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the claim for indemnification is with
respect to a criminal Action against the Indemnified Person, (ii) the
Indemnified Person has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood
exists of a conflict of interest between the Representative and the
Indemnified Person, (iii) the Representative has failed or is failing to
vigorously prosecute or defend such claim, (iv) the claim seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Person as the primary
component of the claim, (v) such claim would materially interfere with or
materially and adversely affect the business, reputation, operations or assets
of the Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, (vi) the amount of Damages
reasonably anticipated to result from such claim or related claims would
exceed (A) $5,000,000 or (B) an amount that when taken together with the then
outstanding Aggregate Pending Claim Amount exceeds the amount then remaining
in the Escrow Fund or (vii) the claim arises out of or results from the
alleged or actual misuse, infringement, misappropriation or violation of any
Person's Intellectual Property, then (1) the Representative shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any such claim or action, (2) the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to conduct and control the defense of
such claim with counsel of its choosing and (3) the Indemnified Person may not
settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Representative
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
The foregoing provisions of this Section 10.04 shall not apply to any Tax
Contest, which shall be governed solely by Section 6.08(g). 



10.05 Waiver. The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations.

10.06 Insurance; Tax Benefits. The amount of any Damages that are subject to
indemnification hereunder shall be calculated net of the amount of insurance
proceeds from any third party insurance maintained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time or the "tail" insurance policy contemplated by Section 6.05(b),
indemnity, contribution or similar payments actually paid to the Indemnified
Person in connection with such Damages (such payments, for these purposes, to
be reduced by any reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining such payments). In
the event that any such insurance proceeds or other third-party
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement payments are actually realized
by an Indemnified Person subsequent to receipt by such Indemnified Person of
any indemnification payment under this Agreement in respect of the claims to
which such insurance proceeds or other third-party indemnification,
contribution or reimbursement payments relate, refunds of such proceeds or
payments (net of any reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Person in
collecting such amounts) shall be made promptly to the Escrow Fund or, if
after the final release of the Escrow Fund, to the Representative for
distribution in accordance with Section 1.08. The amount of any Damages
subject to indemnification under this Article X also shall be calculated net
of any Tax Benefit actually realized by an Indemnified Person on account of
such Damages in the year of the Damages. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit"
for any Indemnified Person means (i) the receipt of any refund of Taxes paid
or (ii) the amount such Indemnified Person's liability for Taxes through a
taxable period, calculated by excluding the relevant amount of credit or
deduction attributable to such Damages, would exceed such Indemnified Person's
actual liability for Taxes through such period, calculated by taking into
account the relevant amount of credit or deduction attributable to such
Damages, and in the case of (i) and (ii), reduced by any tax detriment
attributable to such Damages through such taxable period or realizable in a
future period of the Indemnified Person. Nothing in this Article X regarding
indemnification rights and obligations shall be deemed to override any
obligations with respect to mitigation of damages existing under applicable
Law. The Indemnified Person shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek recovery under all third party insurance policies maintained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time and the "tail" insurance policy
contemplated by Section 6.05(b).



10.07 Exclusivity. From and after the Effective Time, except as provided in
Section 1.07 and except for claims based on fraud, the right to receive
indemnification payments pursuant to this Article X shall be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy exercisable by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or
any of Buyer's Affiliates with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by the Company in, or any other breach by the
Company of, this Agreement.

10.08 Indemnification Claims; Escrow Arrangements. 



(a)No Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under this
Article X unless Buyer (on behalf of such Indemnified Person) has duly
delivered a written notice to the Representative and the Escrow Agent (any
such notice being referred to as a "Notice of Indemnification Claim," and the
claim for indemnification described in such Notice of Indemnification Claim
being referred to as an "Indemnification Claim"), setting forth: (i) the
specific representation and warranty of the Company alleged to have been
inaccurate or breached or specific covenant of the Company alleged to have
been breached or other specific circumstance entitling the Indemnified Person
to such indemnification; (ii) if known, a reasonably detailed description of
the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged inaccuracy in or breach
of such representation and warranty or breach of such covenant or other
specific circumstance entitling the Indemnified Person to such
indemnification; and (iii) if known or reasonably estimable, the aggregate
dollar amount of the Damages that have been, or are reasonably expected to be,
incurred and for which the Indemnified Person is seeking indemnification
hereunder (the aggregate amount of such estimate being referred to as the
"Claimed Amount").



(b)During the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt by the Representative
of a Notice of Indemnification Claim, the Representative may deliver to Buyer
and the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response Notice") in which the
Representative: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer; (ii)
agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer; or
(iii) asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer. Any
Response Notice contemplated by clause (ii) or (iii) shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the Representative's reasons for such
objection. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the
Representative to be owed to Buyer shall be referred to as the "Contested
Amount."



(c)If the Representative delivers a Response Notice to Buyer agreeing that all
or any part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Buyer, then, within three (3)
Business Days following the receipt of such Response Notice by Buyer, Buyer
and the Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release such amount agreed to
by the Representative (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Escrow Fund)
to Buyer from the Escrow Fund. If the Representative fails to deliver a
Response Notice within thirty (30) days after its receipt of a Notice of
Indemnification Claim, the Escrow Agent shall release to Buyer the entire
Claimed Amount.



(d)If the Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute relating
to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt
of the Response Notice by Buyer, then such dispute will be resolved in
accordance with Section 11.17 and Section 11.18 or otherwise by written
agreement between Buyer and the Representative. Following any such resolution,
Buyer and the Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent, within three (3) Business Days after such resolution, a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to make payment, if any, from the Escrow Fund
consistent with such resolution; provided that in connection with any such
resolution, no payment from the Escrow Fund shall be made to the Paying Agent
for payment in accordance with Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement if such
payment would reduce the Aggregate Escrow Balance at the time of any such
payment below the Aggregate Pending Claim Amount as of such time. 



(e)If the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund, including any
interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon (as of any particular
time, the "Aggregate Escrow Balance"), as of the Expiration Date exceeds the
aggregate dollar amount of the Contested Amounts associated with all
Indemnification Claims that have not been finally resolved and (if applicable)
paid (each, an "Unresolved Escrow Claim" and the aggregate dollar amount of
all such Contested Amounts being referred to as the "Aggregate Pending Claim
Amount") prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with this Section 10.08,
then the Escrow Agent shall release the Aggregate Distribution Amount from the
Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for payment in accordance with Section 1.08.
For purposes of this Section 10.08, the "Aggregate Distribution Amount" shall
be the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of the Expiration Date minus the Aggregate
Pending Claim Amount as of the Expiration Date.



(f)Following the Expiration Date, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is finally
resolved, Buyer and the Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days after the final resolution of
such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to
make payments, if any, from the Escrow Fund consistent with such resolution;
provided that in connection with any such resolution, no payment from the
Escrow Fund shall be made to the Paying Agent for payment in accordance with
Section 1.08 of the Merger Agreement if such payment would reduce the
Aggregate Escrow Balance at the time of any such payment below the Aggregate
Pending Claim Amount as of such time.



(g)The parties agree that any amounts released to Buyer from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as a reduction in the aggregate
consideration paid in connection with the Merger for federal income tax
purposes.



ARTICLE IV

MISCELLANEOUS



11.01 [Reserved]



11.02 Acknowledgment by the Buyer Parties. The Buyer Parties knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own
behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that: (a) other than any
representations and warranties in any Letter of Transmittal or Option
Cancellation Agreement, the representations and warranties of the Company
expressly and specifically set forth in Article III, in each case, as
qualified by the Disclosure Schedules and in accordance with the express terms
and conditions (including limitations and exclusions) of this Agreement, are
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties made to the Buyer
Parties and on which the Buyer Parties may rely in connection with the
Transactions; and (b) other than any representations and warranties in any
Letter of Transmittal or Option Cancellation Agreement, all other
representations, warranties and statements of any kind or nature expressed or
implied are, in each case, specifically disclaimed by the Company, on its
behalf and on behalf of the Seller Parties. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Buyer Parties knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and
expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the
Buyer Group, that neither the Company, nor any other Person (including the
Seller Parties), has made, is making or is authorized to make, and 

the Buyer Parties, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group,
hereby knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waive, any warranty or
representation, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or condition of the Company's or its
Subsidiaries' business, operations, assets, liabilities, prospects or any
portion thereof, except solely to the extent expressly set forth in Article
III, in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in connection with the investigation by the
Buyer Parties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Buyer Parties and their
Affiliates, and the representatives of each of the foregoing, have received or
may receive, from or on behalf of the Company, certain projections (whether in
written, electronic or oral form, and including in the electronic dataroom,
management meetings, etc.) (collectively, "Projections"). The Buyer Parties
knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on
their own behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group, that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such Projections, (ii) the Buyer
Parties are familiar with such uncertainties and (iii) the Buyer Parties are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all Projections (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such Projections).



11.03 Provision Respecting Representation of Company. Each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Epstein Becker
and Green, P.C. have been retained by, and may serve as counsel to, each and any
of the Representative, Stockholders and Optionholders and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group"), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Transactions, (b) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Epstein
Becker and Green, P.C. have not acted as counsel for any other party hereto in
connection with the Transactions and that none of the other parties hereto has
the status of a client of Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Epstein Becker and Green, P.C.
for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof, and (c)
that, following consummation of the Transactions, Kirkland and Ellis LLP or
Epstein Becker and Green, P.C. (or any of their respective successors) may serve
as counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, manager,
officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in
connection with any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. In addition, Buyer agrees that (x) all communications prior to
the Effective Time among any member of the Seller Group, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees or Advisors, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Epstein Becker and Green,
P.C. that relate to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
closing under, or any dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement, or
otherwise relating to any potential sale of the Company or the Transactions
(the "Protected Seller Communications"), will be deemed to be privileged and
confidential communications and (y) all rights to such Protected Seller
Communications, the expectation of client confidentiality, and the control of
the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, belong to and will be
retained by the Seller Group. The Protected Seller Communications may be used
by the Seller Group and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection
with any dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement or the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and a third party other than the Seller Group (solely in their capacity as
equityholders of the Company or the Representative), on the other hand, the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege with 

respect to Protected Seller Communications to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications to such third party. The Buyer Parties and the
Seller Parties knowingly, willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and
agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Group and the Seller
Group, respectively, that the agreements contained in this Section 11.03 are
an integral part of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set
forth in this Section 11.03, neither party would enter into this Agreement and
the Company would not recommend approval of this Agreement to the
Stockholders.



11.04 Press Releases and Communications. Buyer and the Representative shall
mutually agree on the initial press release or releases with respect to the
execution of this Agreement. Therefore, prior to the Closing, no press release
or similar public announcement related to this Agreement or the Transactions
will be issued or made by any party to this Agreement or any of its Affiliates
or representatives without the joint approval of Buyer and the Representative,
unless required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock
exchange, in which case Buyer and the Representative, as applicable, will, to
the extent practicable, have the right to review and comment on such press
release or announcement in advance of such publication; provided, that the
foregoing shall not limit the ability of Buyer and its Affiliates to conduct
customary investor and analyst calls concerning the Transactions, to make
internal announcements to their employees, and to make disclosures to
potential sources of financing for the Transactions and credit rating
agencies, so long as the statements contained therein are not inconsistent in
any material respect with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions; provided, further, that the foregoing shall not limit the
ability of the Representative and its Affiliates to make customary
communications with investors concerning the Transactions and to make internal
announcements to their employees, so long as the statements contained therein
are not inconsistent in any material respect with the prior public disclosures
regarding the Transactions and such investors and employees are bound by a
duty of confidentiality with respect to such communications. The parties
acknowledge and agree that Buyer (or any Affiliate thereof) may file this
Agreement, including a summary thereof, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.



11.05 Expenses. Whether or not the Closing takes place, except as otherwise

11.07 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated without the prior written consent of (a) prior to the Closing, the
Company and Buyer and (b) from and after the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation and the Representative; provided, that Buyer and Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement to any of their respective Affiliates; provided,
further, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer or Merger Sub of their
respective obligations under this Agreement. 



11.08 Amendment and Waiver. Except as provided herein, any provision of this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits hereto may be amended or
waived (a) only in a writing signed by Buyer, the Company, the Representative
and, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub; and (b) any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement will be effective against Buyer, the Company, the
Representative or, prior to the Closing, Merger Sub, only as set forth in a
writing executed by such Person. No waiver of any provision hereunder or any
breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.



11.09 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, including Section 6.05 and Article X, nothing expressed or referred to
in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties
to this Agreement any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.



11.10 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against the Persons
that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement.



11.11 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



11.12 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Person. The
headings of the articles, sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and will in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.



11.13 Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been arranged for
purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections corresponding to the
sections of this Agreement; however, each section of the Disclosure Schedules
will be deemed to incorporate by reference all information disclosed in any
other section of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent the relevance of such
information to such other section of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure. Capitalized terms used in the
Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the meanings given
to them in this Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount or the
inclusion of any item in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or the attached exhibits is not intended
to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of business, and
no party will use the fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the
inclusion of any item in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules or exhibits
in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not set forth or included in this Agreement, the
Disclosure Schedules or exhibits is or is not required to be disclosed
(including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed as
material or threatened) or are within or outside of the ordinary course of
business. In addition, matters 

reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedules. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No information set
forth in the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to broaden in any way the
scope of the parties' representations and warranties. The information
contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules and exhibits hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by any party hereto to any
Person of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of
contract.



11.14 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, Paying Agent Agreement, Escrow Agreement and any other agreements
expressly referred to herein or therein (collectively, "Transaction
Documents"), contain the entire agreement of the parties regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement and the Transactions and supersedes all prior
agreements among the parties respecting the sale and purchase of the Company.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with
respect to this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the execution version
of this Agreement will control and prior drafts of this Agreement and the
documents referenced herein will not be considered or analyzed for any purpose
(including in support of parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection
with this Agreement), will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the
meaning of the provisions hereof or the intent of the parties with respect
hereto and will be deemed joint work product of the parties.



11.15 Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or
provision of any other agreement, document or instrument contemplated by this
Agreement, this Agreement will govern and control.



11.16 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if
the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to
consummate the Transactions. It is accordingly agreed that (a) the parties
hereto will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance
or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described in
Section 11.17 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the
right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part
of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor Buyer
would have entered into this Agreement. The parties hereto agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party pursuing an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
11.16 will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such Order. 

The remedies available to Buyer and the Company pursuant to this Section 11.16
will be in addition to any other remedy to which they were entitled at law or
in equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance
will not restrict, impair or otherwise limit Buyer or the Company from seeking
to collect or collecting damages related to the Company's, in the case of
Buyer, or Buyer's or Merger Sub's, in the case of the Company, fraud or
willful breach of this Agreement.



11.17 Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue. Subject to Section 1.07, each of the
parties irrevocably agrees that any Action of any kind whatsoever, including a
counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise
under any legal or equitable theory, that may be based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Transactions brought by any other party or its successors or
assigns will be brought and determined only in the Delaware Chancery Court and
any state court sitting in the State of Delaware to which an appeal from the
Delaware Chancery Court may be validly taken (or, if the Delaware Chancery
Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware and any federal appellate court
therefrom), and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to
its property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the
parties agrees not to commence any Action relating thereto except in the
courts described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by
any such court in Delaware as described herein, and no party will file a
motion to dismiss any Action filed in a state or federal court in the State of
Delaware, on any jurisdictional or venue-related grounds, including the
doctrine of forum non-conveniens. Each party hereby irrevocably consents to
the service of any and all process in any such Action by delivery of such
process in the manner provided in Section 11.06 and agrees not to assert (by
way of motion, as a defense or otherwise) in any Action any claim that service
of process made in accordance with Section 11.06 does not constitute good and
valid service of process.

11.18 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a)This Agreement, and any Action of any kind whatsoever, including a
counterclaim, cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal theory under
which such Liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether
sounding in contract or tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise
under any legal or equitable theory, that may be based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the Transactions will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements
executed and performed entirely within such State without regards to conflicts
of law principles of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction that
would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to
apply.



(b)EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
AND THE 

TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND

ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.



11.19 Representative.



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 11.19, Bain Capital
Partners, LP is designated as the Representative to act on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders for certain limited purposes, as specified
herein. The Necessary Stockholder Approval and receipt of any consideration
pursuant to this Agreement will, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable Law (including DGCL § 251(b)), constitute knowing and irrevocable
ratification and approval of such designation by the Stockholders and the
Optionholders, and authorization of the Representative to serve in such
capacity (including the exclusive power after the Effective Time to negotiate
and settle any and all disputes with Buyer or Merger Sub under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Paying Agent Agreement) and will also constitute a
reaffirmation, approval, consent to, acceptance and adoption of, and an
agreement to comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments, waivers,
releases, covenants and agreements made by the Representative on behalf of the
Stockholders and Optionholders in this Agreement and the other documents
delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement and the
Paying Agent Agreement). The Representative may resign at any time and may be
removed only by the vote of Persons that collectively owned more than fifty
percent (50%) of the Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (x) shares of Common Stock cancelled pursuant to Section
1.04(c) and (y) Dissenting Shares) (such Persons, the "Majority Holders"). The
designation of the Representative is coupled with an interest, and, except as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the
resignation or removal of the Representative, such designation is irrevocable
and will not be affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy,
dissolution or other inability to act of any of the Stockholders or
Optionholders. In the event that a Representative has resigned or been removed
in accordance with this Section 11.19(a), a new Representative will be
appointed by the Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon
the written acceptance thereof by the new Representative. Written notice of
any such resignation, removal, or appointment of a Representative will be
delivered by the Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is taken.
If there is no Representative for a period of fifteen (15) days, then Buyer
may, upon ten (10) days prior notice to the Majority Holders, appoint any
Stockholder as the Representative, who may be removed and replaced as provided
above.



(b)The Representative will have such powers and authority as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and
in any other 

document delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement); provided, however, that the Representative will
have no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders or Optionholders. The
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Buyer, Merger Sub, the Escrow Agent, the
Paying Agent and the Firm will be entitled to rely on the actions taken by the
Representative without independent inquiry into the capacity of the
Representative to so act. All actions, notices, communications and
determinations by the Representative to carry out such functions will
conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and will be binding upon,
the Stockholders and Optionholders. Neither the Representative, nor any of its
officers, directors, employees, partners (general or limited), members,
managers, or Advisors will have any liability to the Stockholders.
Optionholders or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to actions
taken, or omitted to be taken, by the Representative in such capacity (or its
officers, directors, employees, partners (general or limited), members,
managers, or Advisors in connection therewith), except the Representative will
be liable for its actual fraud as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction from which no further appeal may be taken. The Representative
will be entitled to engage such Advisors as it will deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its functions hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Representative) will be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons in
all matters. The Representative (for itself, and for its officers, directors,
employees, partners (general or limited), members, managers, Advisors) will be
entitled to full reimbursement for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances (including fees and disbursements of its Advisors) incurred by or on
behalf of the Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers,
directors, employees, partners (general or limited), members, managers, or
Advisors in connection therewith), and to full indemnification against any
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, costs or expenses arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as Representative (except
for those arising out of the Representative's actual fraud as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no further appeal
may be taken), including the costs and expenses of investigation, defense,
settlement or adjudication of any Action, from the Stockholders and the
Optionholders (including from funds paid to the Representative under this
Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as the
Representative, or funds to be distributed to the Stockholders or
Optionholders under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement and
Paying Agent Agreement)) and all payments required to be made under Article I
are expressly subject to this Section 11.19(b). Each Stockholder and
Optionholder will be responsible for its pro rata portion of any amount owed
to the Representative in accordance with this Section 11.19(b) based upon the
pro rata portion of the Aggregate Fully-Diluted Common Shares held by such
Stockholder or Optionholder immediately prior to the Closing (as finally
calculated pursuant to Section 1.08). In furtherance of the foregoing,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Representative
will have the power and authority to set aside and retain additional funds
paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional funds to be paid to
the Stockholders or Optionholders as Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement at Closing or thereafter (including to establish such reserves as
the Representative determines in good faith to be appropriate for such costs
and expenses that are not then known or determinable). The relationship
created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture or any form of
partnership between or among the Representative or any Stockholder or
Optionholder for any purpose of U.S. federal or state Law, including federal, 

state or foreign income Tax purposes. Neither the Representative nor any of
its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Stockholder or
Optionholder.



(c)Each Buyer Party (on its own behalf, and on behalf of the Buyer Group), and
the Company acknowledges that the Representative is party to this Agreement
solely for purposes of serving as the "Representative" hereunder, and no
Action will be brought by, or on behalf of, any Buyer Party or the Buyer Group
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) against the Representative, with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions or any statement, certificate, instruction, opinion,
instrument or other documents delivered hereunder, in each case, in connection
with the actions of any other party (with it being understood that any
covenant or agreement of or by the "parties" or "each of the parties," other
than those contained in Article XI, will not be deemed to require performance
by, or be an agreement of, the Representative unless performance by the
Representative is expressly provided for in such covenant or the
Representative expressly so agrees in writing, it being further understood
that any such covenant or agreement may be enforced against the
Representative, in its capacity as such, including by an appropriate Action
against the Representative).



11.20 No Right of Set-Off. Each Buyer Party, on its own behalf and on behalf
of the Buyer Group, hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any rights
of set-off, offset or similar rights that any member of the Buyer Group has or
may have with respect to the payment of the Merger Consideration or any other
payments to be made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.



11.21 Counterparts. This Agreement, and any other agreements referred to
herein or therein, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in
multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more
than one party, but all such counterparts taken together will constitute one
and the same instrument. Any counterpart, to the extent signed and delivered
by means of a facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission, will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original contract and will be
considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto
or to any such contract, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such contract will raise the use of a facsimile machine, .pdf or
other electronic transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine, .pdf or other electronic transmission as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

including at the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' offices, in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement.



(h)Any reference to any particular Code section or any Law will be interpreted
