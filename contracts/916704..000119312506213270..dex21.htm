ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _. The Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at
10:00 a.m., San Francisco time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event,
within two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in Article 9
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms or
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 1600 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

Section 2.02 _. The Merger. _ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, as soon as practicable after the Closing, the
Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file with the Delaware Secretary of State
a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in connection with the
Merger in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in
accordance with, Delaware Law.



 

9 (b) The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as
the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State (or at such later time as may be specified in the Certificate of
Merger).

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger
Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.03. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.03(b), Section 2.03(c) or
Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $4.10 in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such
number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.04 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the
"Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the  



 

10  Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares (the "Payment Fund"). The Payment
Fund shall be invested in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is
inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Stock
shall be entitled under Section 2.03, Parent shall take all steps necessary
to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust
additional cash with the Exchange Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
in any event be liable for payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter
of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 2.



 

11 (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect
thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder
of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of unvested Company Restricted
Shares shall be payable pursuant to Section 2.06 and not pursuant to this
Section 2.04 and no deposit shall be made with the Exchange Agent by the
Company or Parent pursuant to this Section 2.04, and the procedures of this
Section 2.04 in respect of holders of shares of Company Stock shall
not apply, with respect to such holders shares of unvested Restricted Stock.

Section 2.05 _. Dissenting Shares. _ Notwithstanding Section 2.03, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") and held by a holder who has not voted
in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and
who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ that
if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holders right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of
Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall provide Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, or to the extent
required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.06 _. Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards; ESPP._ (a)
As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company  



 

12  Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") outstanding under any stock option or
equity compensation plan or agreement (the "Company Stock Plans") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically
at the Effective Time into an option to acquire Parent Stock in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan and option
agreement by which it is evidenced (including any accelerated vesting
provisions therein) except that (i) the number of shares of Parent Stock
subject to each such option shall be determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by a fraction (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the numerator
of which is the per share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which
is the average closing price of Parent Stock on Nasdaq over the five trading
days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective
Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) the exercise
price per share of Parent Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) shall
equal (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided,
however_ that in no case shall the Company Stock Option exchange be performed
in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of
Section 424 of the Code. In case the adjustment would violate the requirements
of Section 424 of the Code, the number of shares of Parent Stock related to
such Company Stock Option not so properly adjusted shall be reduced to award
the holder of the Company Stock Option a substitute option that relates to the
greatest number of shares of Parent Stock permissible pursuant to the
adjustment limitations of Section 424 of the Code.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Award
shall automatically be cancelled, and each share of Company Stock subject to
a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.06(b).
As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, upon receipt
from the Company of a list of holders of Restricted Stock Awards (including
the number of shares that were unvested immediately before the Effective
Time), Parent shall send or cause the Surviving Corporation to send to each
holder of a Restricted Stock Award a letter of transmittal and, upon
confirmation to Parents satisfaction that such list does not duplicate the
shares held by stockholders of record provided to the Exchange Agent for
payment under Section 2.04, shall pay or cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay each such holder the applicable Merger Consideration, less applicable
payroll reporting. Such payment may be made through the Companys payroll
cycle or by separate check. In no event shall this Section and Section 2.04
result in a duplication of payments with respect to any Restricted Stock
Awards with respect to the Merger Consideration.

(c) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.06, including the  



 

13  reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Stock as is necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
each holder of any Company Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to such Company Stock Option. Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject to the Company Stock Options
promptly following the Effective Time (and in any event within fifteen
Business Days after the Effective Time) and use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering such
Company Stock Options for so long as such Company Stock Options remain
outstanding.

(d) The Company shall take all action that is necessary to (i) cause the
exercise of each outstanding purchase right under the Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") no less than five Business Days prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) provide that no further purchase period or offering
period shall commence under the ESPP following the date outstanding purchase
rights under the ESPP are exercised in accordance with clause (i) on this
sentence; and (iii) terminate the ESPP immediately prior to and effective as
of the Effective Time.

Section 2.07 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.08 _. Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of any Tax law. To the extent that amounts so withheld are
paid over to or deposited with the relevant Taxing Authority by or on behalf
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.09 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.

State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such

15  necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock voting
to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the "Stockholder

stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present, the Companys
Board of Directors duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) declaring that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in
the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring

(such recommendation, the "Board Recommendation").

Section 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of (A) the HSR Act and (B) any Applicable Law analogous to the
HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust or merger control matters and in
each case existing in foreign jurisdictions (the "Foreign Competition Laws"),
(iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934
Act, any other applicable U.S. state or federal or foreign securities laws,
or Nasdaq, and (iv) any actions or filings the absence of which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 4.04 _. Non-contravention._ The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03 and that the
Stockholder Approval is obtained, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law or
Judgment, (iii) 



 

16  require any consent under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under,
cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change
of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under, any provision of any Contract
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Governmental
Authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, _provided_ that in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect would result, any
adverse effect otherwise excluded by clause (i) of the definition of Company
Material Adverse Effect shall be taken into account.

Section 4.05 _. Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Stock and 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (of which

authorized and validly issued and are (or, in the case of shares that have not
yet been issued, will be) fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights.



 

17 (b) Section 4.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
close of business on October 17, 2006, a complete and correct list of (i) all
outstanding Company Stock Options, including with respect to each such option,

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since October 17,
2006 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on such
date, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or

as the "Company Securities"), (v) voting trusts, proxies or other similar

respect to the voting of any shares of capital stock of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (vi) contractual obligations or commitments of any character
restricting the transfer of, or requiring the registration for sale of, any

be treated in accordance with Section 2.06.

Section 4.06 _. Subsidiaries._ (a) Section 4.06(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list of each Subsidiary of the
Company, its place and form of organization and each jurisdiction in which it
is authorized to conduct or actually conducts business.



 

18 (b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation or other business entity
duly incorporated or organized (as applicable), validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
and has all corporate or other organizational powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in

Company, or (iii) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance
shares, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or

in clauses (i)-(iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company
Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of
the Company Subsidiary Securities.

(d) Except for the Company Subsidiary Securities, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other equity,
ownership, profit, voting or other interests in, any Person.

made available to Parent, through the Companys SEC filings or otherwise,

other filing with, or furnish any other material to, the SEC.

(c) As of its filing date, each Company SEC Document complied as to form in

the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
1933 Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became

officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true
and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Section 4.08 _. Financial Statements; Internal Controls._ (a) The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial
statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents fairly  



 

20  present, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as

reasonably sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable
assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that
receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorization
of management, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
would materially affect the Companys financial statements. No significant
deficiency or material weakness was identified in managements assessment of
internal controls as of December 31, 2005 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness since been identified).

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the 1934 Act) are reasonably designed to ensure
that (i) all material information (both financial and non-financial) required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under
the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to
the individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the 1934 Act with respect to
such reports.

(d) Since the date of their last certification filed with the SEC, neither the
chief executive officer nor the chief financial officer of the Company
has become aware of any fact, circumstance or change that is reasonably
likely to result in a "significant deficiency" or a "material weakness" in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

(e) The audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company includes an
Audit Committee Financial Expert, as defined by Item 401(h)(2) of Regulation

the Company, there have been no violations of provisions of the Companys code
of ethics by any such persons.

Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the

(h) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating

pay benefits accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued
benefits, together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded
the present value of all benefits (actual or contingent) accrued as of such
date of all participants and past participants therein in respect of which the

agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Except as
required by the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company,
neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall
fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Board Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or take any action
or make any statement inconsistent with the Board Recommendation) or resolve
or agree to take any such action (any of the foregoing, an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with  



 

43  any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any

negotiations or discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the

unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company reasonably believes, after considering the advice of its outside legal
counsel and of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) thereafter furnish to
such Third Party non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement dated as of July 27, 2006 between the Company and Parent
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") (and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this 6.04 (b)) (a
copy of which shall be promptly (in all events within 48 hours) provided for
informational purposes only to Parent), (iii) following receipt of and on
account of such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or (iv) terminate this Agreement pursuant to and subject to the
terms of Section 10.01(d)(ii), and/or (v) take any non-appealable, final
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company to take,
but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a
majority vote, after the receipt of the advice of outside legal counsel to the
Company, that it must take such action to comply with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal. Any action taken
or statement made pursuant to this Section 6.04(b) shall not constitute a
breach of the Companys representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions
referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) of the preceding subsection unless
the Company shall have delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising
Parent that it intends to take such action. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (or any of its or their Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the non-public
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party or any other  



 

44  indication that a Third Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall
identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of,
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep
Parent informed, as promptly as practicable, of the status and terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, including the material
resolved and unresolved issues related thereto and material amendments or
proposed amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company
shall promptly provide Parent with (i) any non-public information concerning
the Companys business, present or future performance, financial condition or
results of operations provided to any Third Party that was not previously
provided to Parent and (ii) copies of all documents and written
communications relating to such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the

the one hand, and the Third Party making a such Acquisition Proposal or any of
its Representatives, on the other hand.

Effective Time and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company

the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers of Grant
Thornton LLP and KPMG LLP), and (iii) instruct its Representatives to
cooperate with each other party in its investigation; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (i)
any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information, (ii) such disclosure would, based on the
advice of such partys counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable
to such information, (iii) the disclosure of such information to the other
party would violate confidentiality obligations owed to a third party and such
confidentiality obligations were in effect prior to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, or (iv) such disclosure relates to individual
performance or personnel evaluation records, medical histories or other
personnel information that in the Companys good faith opinion could subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to liability. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. 

Section 6.06. _401(k) Plans_. Effective as of the day immediately preceding
the Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least
ten business days prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions
necessary to effect the termination of any and all 401(k) plans sponsored or
maintained by Company and shall provide Parent evidence that each of
Companys 401(k) plans has been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company.

Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to remediate

fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement
or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Person") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys and other
professionals fee and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are
paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, employee benefit plan,
trust or other enterprise or by reason of anything done or not done by such
person in any such capacity prior to or at the Effective Time (whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) ("Indemnified
Liabilities"), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or

permitted under Applicable Law (and the Surviving Corporation shall pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law).



 

46 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving

reimburse Parent and the Surviving Corporation for all amounts advanced
pursuant to this Section 7.03.

Section 7.03(d), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the "Current Premium"), which
amount is set forth in Section 7.03(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed 200% of the
Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporations good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to 200% of the Current Premium.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

addition to, and not in substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Person
may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or
any  



 

47  of its Subsidiaries, by contract or under any Applicable Law. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his heirs and
Representatives and may not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect in any material respect any Indemnified Party without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party.

Section 7.04. _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) For one year after the Effective
Time, Parent shall permit all Company employees who become employees of
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) to participate in the benefit programs of Parent or such
Subsidiary to substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees
of Parent or such Subsidiary.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor and assume all employment, severance and retention agreements as in
effect as of the date hereof which are set forth in Section 4.16 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided, however_ , that this Section 7.04 is

58 Section 11.05 _. Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants or
conditions, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement, and (b) any other representations and
warranties of the Company that are contained in this Agreement, but only if
the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
on its face. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself
and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company.
The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement.

Section 11.06 _. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._ (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.03,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03, no provision of
this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns; _provided, however_ , that
from and after the Effective Time, the stockholders of the Company and holders
of Company Restricted Stock Units shall be third party beneficiaries of
Article 2 of this Agreement and shall have the right to enforce such
provisions, including the right to seek and recover any and all damages that
the stockholders of the Company and holders of Company Restricted Stock Units
may incur or suffer as a result of a breach of such provisions.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of their Affiliates at any time; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any of
its obligations hereunder. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing shall
be null and void.

Section 11.07 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State.

Section 11.08 _. Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware  



 

59  state court, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party.

Section 11.09 _. Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 11.10 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to their subject matter.

Section 11.12 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



 

60 Section 11.13 _. Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state
court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.

Section 11.14. _No Other Representations or Warranties._ (a) Each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties made by the Company in Article 4, the Company has not made and
shall not be deemed to have made to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
representatives or Affiliates, and neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary nor
any of their representatives or Affiliates have relied upon, any
representation or warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except to the extent covered by a representation or warranty made
by the Company and contained in Article 4, each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary agrees that neither the Company, any holder of the Companys
securities nor any of their respective Affiliates or representatives, makes or
has made any representation or warranty to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any
of their representatives or Affiliates with respect to:

(i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their respective representatives or
Affiliates; or 

(ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore or hereafter
delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their
respective representatives or Affiliates, including the information in the on-
line data room, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same
be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine
whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or
included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.
