Laws of the state of its incorporation or formation. Each Seller Party (other
than any individual) is duly qualified and in good standing under the Laws of
each other jurisdiction that requires qualification, except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or delay or materially affect
the Sellers' ability to close. Each Seller Party (other than any individual)
has full power and authority to carry on the business in which it is engaged,
and to own and use the properties owned and used by it except where the

equity or at law);

  

  

(B) such Acquired Contract will continue to be so enforceable on terms
identical to those contemplated in (A) above following the consummation of the
Transaction Agreements (except for those that expire at the end of their term,

Schedule 4(l) lists all Permits by any Governmental Authority and all quality
certificates granted by any industry organization and used or held by the
Sellers in connection with the ownership and operation of the Business except

result in a Seller Adverse Effect of more than $50,000. Such Permits
constitute all Permits necessary for the continued ownership, use and lawful
operation of the Business, consistent in all material respects with the past
practices of the Business. The Sellers are not in default, and, to the
Sellers' Knowledge, no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default under any of any Permits except such
unenforceability, defaults or conditions that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a Seller Adverse Effect of more than $50,000.

any court or quasi-judicial or administrative agency of any federal, state,
local or foreign jurisdiction, or is the subject of any pending or, to the

Governmental Authority, against any of them giving rise to any Obligation of
which the Sellers would be subject.

  

  

(n) Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in Schedule 4(n):

  

  

(i) Except to the extent non-compliance would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to constitute a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, each Seller is and has been in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Requirements.

  

  

(ii) Except to the extent non-compliance would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to constitute a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, (a) each Seller has obtained, or has timely sought to renew (and has

and records, as necessary under applicable Environmental Requirements for

operated), and (b) all such Permits and filings remain in full force and
effect. Schedule 4(n)(ii) sets forth a complete list of all Permits as are

the Business is, subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order,
decree or ruling under any Environmental Requirements.

(v) All Hazardous Substances generated, transported, handled, stored, treated
or disposed by, in connection with or as a result of the operation of the
Sellers or the conduct of the Sellers (including their Affiliates) of the
Business, have been transported only by carriers maintaining valid
authorizations under applicable Environmental Requirements and treated,
stored, disposed of or otherwise handled only at facilities maintaining valid
authorizations under applicable Environmental Requirements and, to the
Sellers' Knowledge, such carriers and facilities (A) have been and are
operating in compliance with such authorizations and (B) are not the subject
of any existing, pending or threatened action, investigation or inquiry by any
Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with any Environmental
Requirements.

Eligible Employees.

  

  

(ii) Offers of Employment. The Buyer or its designee(s) may offer to hire any
Eligible Employee on terms acceptable to the Buyer at any time prior to the

benefits to the Eligible Employees, to any of the Sellers' employees not
accepting a position with the Buyer or its Affiliates, or to any currently
retired former employees of the Sellers.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) Timing of Transfer. Each Eligible Employee who accepts the Buyer or its
designees' offer of employment shall become an employee of the Buyer or its
designee(s) in accordance with the terms of such offer. At such time that the
Eligible Employees become employees of the Buyer (hereafter, such employees
are referred to as "Continued Employees"), the Buyer or its designee(s) shall
become responsible for payment of all salaries, wages, severance, accrued and
unused vacation, and benefits and all other claims (including medical, dental,
vision, disability and other benefits claimed), costs, expenses, liabilities
and other obligations relating to the employment of the Continued Employees

"plant closing" or "mass layoff," the Buyer or its designee(s) will not engage
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date in a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" (as such terms are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, as amended, or any similar state law) with respect to the
Acquired Assets.

  

  

(vi) No Solicitation. From the date of this Agreement until one year from and
after the Buyer or its designee hires any Eligible Employee, the Sellers agree
not to (and shall cause their Affiliates not to) solicit, offer employment to
or employ any Continued Employee without the prior written consent of the
Buyer; provided that, the foregoing shall not prohibit general solicitations
of employment not specifically directed toward such employees or the hiring of
such employees in response thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement
of any such employee who presents himself or herself for employment without
direct or indirect solicitation by the Sellers or any Affiliate of the
Sellers.

representations and warranties of such Party contained in Articles 3 and 4 of
this Agreement, such Party shall have the continuing obligation until the

the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Schedules. Any such correction, supplement, or amendment
shall be delivered to the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable, but
no later than three (3) business days after discovery, but in any event, prior
to the Closing Date. For all purposes of this Agreement, including for
purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 8 have
been fulfilled, the Schedules shall be deemed to include only that information
contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude
all information contained in any such correction, supplement, or amendment
thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(o) Surveys. The Buyer may, at its own cost, conduct a survey of any or each
Vessel; provided, however, that any such survey cannot unreasonably interfere
with the operations, or adversely affect the economics, of the Business.

  

  

(p) Transition Services Agreement Factor. The Buyer and the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to reach a mutually acceptable agreement
on the factor for Section 5(a) of the Transition Service Agreement as soon as
reasonably practical.

  

  

6. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties agree as follows:

  

  

(a) General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Section 8).

  

  

(b) Retained Obligations. Prior to or contemporaneous with the Closing, the
Sellers shall pay all amounts set forth in the Payment Instruction Letters and
all other Indebtedness other than Assumed Obligations. The Sellers agree to
timely pay and satisfy all other Retained Obligations as and when due.

  

  

(c) Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or before the Closing Date
involving the Business, the other Party shall cooperate with the contesting or
defending Party and its counsel in the defense or contest, make available its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to its books and records
(other than books and records which are subject to privilege or to
confidentiality restrictions) as shall be necessary in connection with the
defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor under Section 8).

  

  

(d) Non-assignment; Holding Arrangement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent the Parties elect or are
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to obtaining
a third party consent identified on Schedules 4(b) and 7(a)(vii) with respect
to any Acquired Asset (each a "Non-Assigned Asset"), such Non-Assigned Asset
shall be held by the Sellers for all times during the Holding Period (as
defined below), and during such Holding Period (i) the Sellers shall provide
the Buyer with the economic benefits and risks thereof, (ii) the Sellers shall
continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the third
party consent(s) related to such Non-Assigned Asset, and the Buyer shall
cooperate with the Sellers in such efforts, and (iii) the Buyer shall be
entitled to enforce at its sole cost and expense, any and all rights of the
Sellers or the relevant Seller against a third party with respect to such Non-
Assigned Asset; provided that the Sellers hereby constitute and appoint,
effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer and its successors and assigns as
the true and lawful attorney of the Sellers, as applicable with full

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

power of substitution in the name of the Buyer, or in the name of the Sellers,
but for the benefit of the Buyer, to institute and prosecute all proceedings
which the Buyer may in its sole discretion deem proper in order to assert or
enforce any right, title or interest in, to or under the Non-Assigned Assets
or take other actions reasonably necessary to obtain the benefits of such Non-
Assigned Assets, and to defend or compromise any and all actions, suits or
proceedings in respect of such Non-Assigned Assets. The Buyer shall be
entitled to retain for the Buyer's account any amounts collected pursuant to
the foregoing powers, including any amounts payable as interest in respect
thereof. The Sellers will promptly pay to the Buyer when received all monies
received by the Sellers under any Non-Assigned Asset or any claim or right or
any benefit arising thereunder. At such time as the third party consent for a
Non-Assigned Asset is obtained, the Sellers shall promptly assign such Non-
Assigned Asset to the Buyer in a form mutually agreed between the Parties. In
consideration for the foregoing, during the Holding Period, the Buyer shall
directly pay (on behalf of the Sellers) all Obligations that would constitute
Assumed Obligations if the Non-Assigned Asset were an Acquired Asset and all
of the costs of administering the Non-Assigned Asset from and after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, if the Non-Assigned Asset is an
easement or similar right, then the term Non-Assigned Asset shall include that
portion of the associated plant, facility fixtures or other assets owned by
the Sellers and located thereon. For purposes of this Section 6(d) the term
"Holding Period" for any particular Non-Assigned Asset shall mean the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on earlier of the date upon which (y)
the contract for which consent was not obtained expires or (z) such consent or
an alternative arrangement is obtained on terms that are substantially similar
to the Buyer in both operational and economical respects.

  

  

(e) Delivery and Retention of Records. Within 45 days after the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Buyer, copies of Tax
Records that are relevant to Post-Closing Tax Periods and all other files,
books, records, information and data relating to the Business (other than Tax
Records) that are in the possession or control of the Sellers; provided that
such access shall not be construed to require the disclosure of records that
would cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work product or like privilege;
provided, further, that in the event of any litigation nothing herein shall
limit any Party's rights of discovery under applicable Law.

  

  

(f) Post-Closing Collection Matters. At any time after the Closing that the
Sellers or its Affiliates receive any payment related to the Business which is
due to the Buyer, the Sellers will promptly remit such payment to the Buyer
for the benefit of the Buyer. At any time after the Closing that either the
Buyer or its Affiliates receive any remittance from any account debtors with
respect to the Business which is due to the Sellers, the Buyer will endorse
such remittance to the order of the Sellers and forward it to the Sellers
promptly upon receipt.

  

  

(g) Tax Clearance Certificates. Promptly after the Closing Date, the Sellers
agree to order and obtain tax certificates for each of FMT and FMT Heavy
evidencing no taxes due from the Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation
and the Kentucky Department of Revenue, and shall pay any unpaid taxes
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers shall
provide the Buyer with such certificates promptly after they are received.

  

  

(h) Employee Access. From the Closing through the Transition Services
Termination Date, the Buyer shall continue to have the same rights it had
pursuant to Section 5(m) from the date of this Agreement through the Closing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Maintenance Services. From the date of this Agreement until the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) each Seller agrees to (and to cause each
of its Affiliates to) provide the Buyer and each of its Affiliates maintenance
and repair services for any vessels owned or operated by any such Person on
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to such Person than the most
preferential terms and conditions the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
provides (or have provided) to any Person, and (ii) the Buyer and the Sellers
acknowledge and agree that they desire to expand their maintenance and repair
arrangements to the extent such arrangements are mutually beneficial (as
determined in each Person's sole discretion).

  

  

(j) Flowers Option. If any Seller or any of its Affiliates (a "Flowers
Purchaser"), directly or indirectly (including by merging with, or acquiring
any Equity Interest of, another Person), acquires all or any of the Flowers
Vessels (a "Flowers Purchase"), except to the extent such acquisition is
effected pursuant to a like-kind exchange between Flowers and FMT, Buyer shall
have the right to acquire each such Flowers Vessel from the Sellers or the
Flowers Purchaser for the same price and on the same terms as the Flowers
Purchaser, except should such Flowers Purchase contain terms and conditions
that would serve to prohibit or unreasonably restrict the ability of Buyer to
match such terms (other than the purchase price for the acquired Flowers
Vessels), then Buyer may disregard such terms and conditions and acquire such
Flowers Vessels without such terms and conditions (the foregoing right being
the "Flowers Purchase Option"). Promptly after each Flowers Purchase, the
Sellers shall provide written notice the Buyer of same, including a summary of
the terms of the Flowers Purchase and a copy of the agreements relating to the
Flowers Purchase. The Buyer's option to purchase any Flowers Vessels pursuant
to this Agreement shall commence on the date of the agreements underlying the
relevant Flowers Purchase and shall expire 60 days after the Buyer receives
such written notice and the related information from the Sellers. If the Buyer
exercises any Flowers Purchase Option, the purchase of the relevant Flowers
Vessels shall close no later than 90 days following such exercise. If any
Seller or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly (including by merging
with, or acquiring any Equity Interest of, another Person), acquires the right
to acquire all or any of the Flowers Vessels (a "Flowers Option Purchase"),
except to the extent such right is acquired pursuant to a like-kind exchange
between Flowers and FMT, Buyer shall have the right to acquire such Flowers
Option Purchase free of cost, in lieu of consummating any Flowers Purchase.
The Sellers agree to ensure that the Buyer's rights pursuant to this Section
6(j) are fully enforceable, regardless of whether a Seller or any of its
Affiliates acquires any Flowers Vessel or an option to acquire same.

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) In the event of: (x) (1) any breach of the Buyer's covenants or
obligations in this Agreement or (2) any inaccuracy, violation or breach in
any representation or warranty (without giving effect to any supplement to the
Schedules or any qualification as to materiality) contained in Sections 3(b)
(Authorization of Transaction), and 3(d) (Brokers)), (y) there is an
applicable survival period pursuant to Section 8(a); and (z) the Seller
Indemnitees make a written claim for indemnification against the Buyer
pursuant to Section 11(k) within such survival period, then from and after the
Closing, the Buyer agrees to release and indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from
and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences suffered by the Seller
Indemnitees to the extent relating to or arising from such inaccuracy,
violation or breach described in clause (x) of this Section 8(c)(ii).

  

  

(iii) The Buyer shall release, indemnify, and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees against any and all Obligations, liabilities, expenses, costs and
Adverse Consequences arising from or relating to the Assumed Obligations.

  

  

(iv) To the extent any Seller Indemnitee becomes liable to, and is ordered to
and does pay to any third party that is not a Seller Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, special or consequential damages caused by any matter for which
such Seller Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 8(c),
then such punitive, exemplary, special or consequential damages shall be
deemed actual damages to such Seller Indemnitee and included within the
definition of Adverse Consequences for purposes of this Section 8. Except to
the extent specified in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to
third party claims, the Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnitee for
any exemplary, punitive, special or consequential damages.

  

  

(v) Notwithstanding anything in Section 8(c)(i) of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Buyer ever be required to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees for Adverse Consequences under Section 8(c)(i) in an amount
exceeding, in the aggregate, $40,000,000.

  

  

(d) Matters Involving Third Parties.

  

  

(i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under
this Section 8, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event
within five (5) business days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim)
notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the defense of
such claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give
such notice, including having the effect of tolling or suspending the statute
of limitations applicable to such claim.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for or results
in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or for any damages
or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified Party, any
finding of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party or
any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the conduct of any business
by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).

  

  

(iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in Section 8(d)(i), the Indemnified Party may defend
against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate.

  

  

(iv) In no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably.

  

  

(e) Indemnification of Negligence of Indemnitee. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED
IN THIS ARTICLE 8 WILL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE SOLE, JOINT OR
CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN. THE
PARTIES AGREE THE PRECEDING SENTENCE IS COMMERCIALLY CONSPICUOUS.

  

  

(f) No Waiver of Rights or Remedies. Each Indemnified Party's rights and
remedies set forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will not be
deemed waived by such Indemnified Party's consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will be effective regardless of any
inspection or investigation conducted, or the awareness of any matters
acquired (or capable or reasonably capable of being acquired), by or on behalf
of such Indemnified Party or by its directors, officers, employees, or
representatives or at any time (regardless of whether notice of such awareness
has been given to Indemnifying Party), whether before or after the date of
this Agreement or the Closing Date with respect to any circumstances
constituting a condition under this Agreement, unless any waiver specifically
so states.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences. The Adverse Consequences
giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be limited to
the loss suffered by the Indemnified Party (reduced by any insurance proceeds
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the
events giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of any expenses
related to the receipt of such proceeds as well as any Tax Benefit recognized
by the Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which it is a member)
occasioned by such loss or damage). The amount of the loss and the amount of
the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into account the timing of
the loss or payment, as applicable, using a Prime Rate plus 2% interest or
discount rate, as appropriate. Upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with information
sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the amount of the
indemnity payment in accordance with this Section 8(g). An Indemnified Party
shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect of any claim
for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable efforts to
avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs and
expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

  

  

(h) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Parties hereto agree that all
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment made
under Section 9, shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for Tax
purposes.

  

  

(i) Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy. After the Closing, the rights and remedies
set forth in this Article 8 and Article 9 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties under or with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement except for any non-monetary, equitable relief
to which any Party may be entitled or any remedies for willful misconduct or
fraud.

  

  

(j) Additional Remedy Matters. To the extent any claim may be recoverable
pursuant to more than one Section of this Article 8, the Indemnified Party may
make such claim under any such Section in the alternative.

  

  

9. Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Post-Closing Tax Returns. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed any Post-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the
Acquired Assets. The Buyer shall pay (or cause to be paid) any Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns.

  

  

(b) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with respect to the
Acquired Assets. Copies of such Pre-Closing Tax Returns will be provided to
the Buyer as soon as practicable prior to filing. The Sellers shall pay or
cause to be paid any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

  

  

(c) Straddle Periods. The Buyer shall be responsible for Taxes of the Acquired
Assets related to the portion of any Straddle Period occurring after the
Closing Date. The Sellers shall be responsible for Taxes of the Acquired
Assets relating to the portion of any Straddle Period occurring before and
ending on the Closing Date. With respect to any Straddle Period, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers or the Buyer shall elect to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the Tax period. If applicable Law shall not
permit the Closing Date to be the last day of a Tax period, then (i) real or
personal property Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets shall be allocated
based on the number of days in the partial periods ending on the Closing Date
and beginning after the Closing Date, (ii) in the case of all other Taxes
based on or in respect of income, the Tax computed on the basis of the taxable
income or loss attributable to the Acquired Assets for each partial period as
determined from their books and records, and (iii) in the case of all other
Taxes, on the basis of the actual activities or attributes of the Acquired
Assets for each partial period as determined from their books and records.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Straddle Returns. The Buyer shall prepare any Straddle Returns. The Buyer
shall deliver, at least 45 days prior to the due date for filing such Straddle
Return (including any extension) to the Sellers a statement setting forth the
amount of Tax that the Sellers owes, including the allocation of taxable
income, if any, and Taxes under Section 9(c), and copies of such Straddle
Return. The Sellers shall have the right to review such Straddle Returns and
the allocation of taxable income, if any, and liability for Taxes and to
suggest to the Buyer any reasonable changes to such Straddle Returns no later
than 15 days prior to the date for the filing of such Straddle Returns. The
Sellers and the Buyer agree to consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith
any issue arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Returns and
allocation of taxable income, if any, and liability for Taxes and mutually to
consent to the filing as promptly as possible of such Straddle Returns. Not
later than five (5) days before the due date for the payment of Taxes with
respect to such Straddle Returns, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes as agreed to by the Buyer and the
Sellers as being owed by the Sellers. If the Buyer and the Sellers cannot
agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the Sellers with respect to a Straddle
Return, the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer the amount of
Taxes reasonably determined by the Sellers to be owed by the Sellers. Within
ten (10) days after such payment, the Sellers and the Buyer shall refer the
matter to an independent "Big-Four" accounting firm agreed to by the Buyer and
the Sellers to arbitrate the dispute. The Sellers and the Buyer shall equally
share the fees and expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as
to the amounts owed by the Sellers and the Buyer with respect to a Straddle
Return shall be binding on the Sellers and the Buyer. Within five (5) days
after the determination by such accounting firm, if necessary, the appropriate
Party shall pay the other Party any amount which is determined by such
accounting firm to be owed.

  

  

(e) Claims for Refund. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, file any claim for refund of Taxes with respect to the
Acquired Assets for whole or partial taxable periods on or before the Closing
Date.

  

  

(f) Indemnification. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers against the
Obligations of the Buyer pursuant to Sections 9(h) and all Taxes of or with
respect to the Acquired Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period and the portion
of any Straddle Period occurring after the Closing Date. The Sellers agree to
indemnify the Buyer against all Taxes to the extent contemplated by Section
9(h) (other than ad valorem and property Taxes to the extent prorated and
included in the Purchase Price) of or with respect to the Acquired Assets for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Straddle Period occurring on
or before the Closing Date.

  

  

(g) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(i) The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 9(g) and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

  

  

(ii) The Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) Certain Taxes. The Sellers shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and fees, provided, however,
the Sellers shall present to the Buyer such Tax Returns and other
documentation for the Buyer's review and consent no later than ten (10) days
before the due date of such Tax Returns and other documentation (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If required by applicable Law,
the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of
any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall pay any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and fees
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. To the extent deducted in calculating the Purchase Price, the Buyer
shall be responsible for and shall pay the pro rata portion of ad valorem and
other property Taxes accruing and unpaid prior to the Closing Date for the
first Tax period ending after the Closing Date with respect to the Acquired
Assets.

  

  

(i) Confidentiality. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall be
kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, Tax audits, Tax claims and
Tax litigation, or as required by Law.

  

  

(j) Audits. The Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to the other Parties of any pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to the Acquired
Assets for whole or partial periods for which it is indemnified by any other
Party hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall be
accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received from or with
any Tax authority in respect of any such matters. If an Indemnified Party has
Knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter for which it
is to be indemnified hereunder and such party fails to give the Indemnifying
Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, then (i) if the
Indemnifying Party is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from
contesting the asserted Tax liability in any forum, the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Taxes
arising out of such asserted Tax liability, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party
is not so precluded from contesting, but such failure to give prompt notice
results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then any amount which the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay the Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Section 9(j) shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment,
provided, the Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to full
indemnification hereunder to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
party can establish that the Indemnifying Party was not prejudiced by such
failure. This Section 9(j) shall control the procedure for Tax indemnification
matters to the extent it is inconsistent with any other provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

(k) Control of Proceedings. The party responsible for the Tax under this
Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including
action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). The Sellers and the
Buyer shall jointly control, in good faith with each other, audits and
disputes relating to Straddle Periods. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses with
respect to such contests shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyer in
proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the noncontrolling
party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in such
proceedings at its own expense.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(l) Powers of Attorney. The Buyer and its respective Affiliates shall provide
the Sellers and their Affiliates with such powers of attorney or other
authorizing documentation as are reasonably necessary to empower them to
execute and file returns it is responsible for hereunder, file refund and
equivalent claims for Taxes it is responsible for, and contest, settle, and
resolve any audits and disputes that it has control over under Section 9(k)
(including any refund claims which turn into audits or disputes).

  

  

(m) Remittance of Refunds. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer receives
a refund of any Taxes that the Sellers are responsible for hereunder, or if
the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers receives a refund of any Taxes
that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the Party receiving such refund
shall, within 30 days after receipt of such refund, remit it to the Party who
has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose of this Section
9(m), the term "refund" shall include a reduction in Tax and the use of an
overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and receipt of a refund shall
occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an adjustment thereto using such
reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the receipt of cash.

  

  

(n) Purchase Price Allocation. The Sellers and the Buyer agree that the actual
Purchase Price allocable to the Acquired Assets shall be allocated to the
Acquired Assets for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting
purposes) as jointly agreed between the Buyer and the Sellers as soon as
practicable, but in any event no later than 90 days following the Closing
Date. The Buyer, the Sellers and their applicable Affiliates shall file all
Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) and
information reports in a manner consistent with such allocation.

  

  

(o) Closing Tax Certificate. At the Closing, each of the Sellers shall deliver
to the Buyer a Closing Tax Certificate, signed under penalties of perjury (i)
stating it is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust or
foreign estate, (ii) providing its U.S. Employer Identification Number and
(iii) providing its address, all pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) The Sellers may terminate this Agreement, if the Sellers are not in

contained in this Agreement, by giving written notice to the Buyer at any time
before Closing (A) in the event of any inaccuracy, violation or breach of any

competent jurisdiction or any governmental, administrative or regulatory
authority, agency or body shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
shall have taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable.

  

  

(b) Effect of Termination. Except for the obligations under Articles 9, 10 and
11, if any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10(a), all
rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any
liability of any Party to any other Party and except that termination of this
Agreement will not affect any liability of any Party for any breach of this
Agreement prior to termination, or any breach at any time of the provisions
hereof surviving termination.

  

  

11. Miscellaneous.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) Confidentiality.

  

  

(i) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, not make
disclosure of any Confidential Information to any Person other than (A) to
their respective owners, directors, officers, employees, consultants or other
representatives to whom such disclosure is necessary or reasonably convenient
for the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B) as
required to convey title to any of the Acquired Assets; (C) as required by Law
or any securities exchange or market rule; (D) as may be requested or required
by any Governmental Authority (provided that the Sellers first notify the
Buyer and give the Buyer the opportunity to contest such request or
requirement), (E) to the extent that the Confidential Information is or
becomes generally available to the public through no fault of the Sellers or
their Affiliates making such disclosure, (F) to the extent that the same
information is in the possession (on a non-confidential basis) of the Sellers
making such disclosure prior to receipt of such Confidential Information, (G)
to the extent that the Sellers that received the Confidential Information
independently develop the same information without in any way relying on any
Confidential Information, (H) to the extent that the same information becomes
available to the Sellers making such disclosure on a nonconfidential basis
from a source other than the Buyer, the Sellers or the Affiliates of either of
them, which source, to the Sellers' Knowledge, is not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation
to the Buyer, or (I) with prior notice of request for disclosure to, and
consent of, the Buyer (which consent may be withheld in the Buyer's sole
discretion).

  

  

(ii) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, treat and hold as
such all of the Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. If any
Seller is ever requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any action) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Sellers will notify the Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with this Section 11(a)(ii). If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Sellers, on the
written advice of counsel, are compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any Government Authority, arbitrator, or mediator or else stand
liable for contempt, that the Sellers may disclose the Confidential
Information to the Government Authority, arbitrator, or mediator; provided,
however, that the Sellers will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
obtain, at the request of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as the Buyer may designate.

  

  

(b) Insurance.

  

  

(i) The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to file,
notice, and otherwise continue to pursue any Insurance Rights that the Buyer
desires to pursue, provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section
11(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Sellers'
rights to cancel the coverage(s) of any of the Insurance Policies in respect
of any fact, circumstance or event relating to the Acquired Assets or Business
that occurs or arises after the Closing.

  

  

(ii) Each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, file all insured
claims (both before and after Closing) that may be filed under any Insurance
Policy issued to it or its Affiliates and will thereafter coordinate with the
Buyer to resolve all of the Buyer's claims relating to the Insurance Rights.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, will each bear
their own costs and expenses (including those of Affiliates) incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including all fees and expenses of agents, representatives,
financial advisors, legal counsel and accountants.

  

  

(d) No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except for the indemnification provisions，
this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other
than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(e) Succession. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

  

  

(f) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple identical
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

(g) Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits, Schedules and other
attachments identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof. If there is any conflict or other inconsistency
between this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules, the terms of this
Agreement shall prevail. To the extent of any ambiguity, inconsistency or
conflict between this Agreement and any other Transaction Agreement, the terms
of this Agreement will prevail.

  

  

(h) Set off Rights. The Buyer will have the option of setting off all or any
part of any amounts, including damages, due it or its Affiliates under any
Transaction Agreement by notifying the Sellers that the Buyer is electing to
set off the amount outstanding under this Agreement by such amount. The
Buyer's exercise, if in good faith, of its set off rights will not constitute
a breach of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement.

  

  

(i) Remedies. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights, obligations and
remedies created by this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other
rights, obligations or remedies otherwise available at law or in equity.
Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein will be considered an
election of remedies.

  

  

(j) Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

(m) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement
shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Buyer and
the Sellers. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or
breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  

  

(n) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(o) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local, or foreign statute
or Law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall
mean including without limitation. All personal pronouns used in this
Agreement, whether used in the masculine, feminine or neuter gender, shall
include all other genders; the singular shall include the plural, and vice
versa. All references herein to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections or
subdivisions thereof shall refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules,
Article, Section or subdivision thereof of this Agreement unless specific
reference is made to such exhibits, articles, sections or subdivisions of
another document or instrument. The terms "herein," "hereby," "hereunder,"
"hereof," "hereinafter," and other equivalent words refer to this Agreement in
its entirety and not solely to the particular portion of the Agreement in
which such word is used. The words "shall" and "will" are used interchangeably
throughout this Agreement and shall accordingly be given the same meaning,
regardless of which word is used. Except to the extent expressly provided to
the contrary, references to a Party include its permitted successors and
assigns. Each certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
a part hereof, and any representation, warranty or covenant herein referenced
or affirmed in such certificate shall be treated as a representation, warranty
or covenant given in the correlated Section hereof on the date of such
certificate. Additionally, any representation, warranty or covenant made in
any such certificate shall be deemed to be made herein. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature
shall be construed in accordance with GAAP, as in effect from time to time.

  

  

(p) Entire Agreement. THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO
HEREIN) CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND SUPERSEDES ANY
PRIOR UNDERSTANDINGS, AGREEMENTS, OR REPRESENTATIONS BY OR AMONG THE PARTIES
(OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT), WRITTEN OR
ORAL, TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF.
UPON CLOSING, GEL IS HEREBY RELEASED FROM ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

  

  

(q) Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other
Parties would be damaged irreparably if any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached.
Accordingly, and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 11(l), each Party
agrees that the other Parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and its terms and provisions in any action
instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(r) Joint and Several Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the covenants, agreements and obligations of, and the
representations and warranties made by or attributable to, each Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, including
obligations to make indemnity payments, will be deemed to be made by and
attributable to all Sellers, jointly and severally, and the Buyer will have
the right to pursue remedies against any or all such Persons without any
obligation to give notice to or pursue remedies against any other Person. Each
Seller acknowledges and agrees that it has irrevocably appointed FMT, as its
sole representative with power and authority to act under this Agreement,
including making elections under this Agreement, amend or otherwise modify
this Agreement and receiving delivery of the Purchase Price. In the event FMT
is unavailable or unwilling to serve as such representative, each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that it has irrevocably appointed Principal as its
sole alternate representative with power and authority to act under this
Agreement, including making elections under this Agreement, amending or
otherwise modifying this Agreement and receiving delivery of the Purchase
Price.
