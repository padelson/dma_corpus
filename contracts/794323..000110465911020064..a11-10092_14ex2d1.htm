 ** _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF AMALGAMATION_**

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF AMALGAMATION, dated as of April 10, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, INC, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), APOLLO AMALGAMATION SUB, LTD., a Bermuda exempted limited
liability company and a direct Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent ("
_Amalgamation Sub_ "), and GLOBAL CROSSING LIMITED, a Bermuda exempted limited
liability company (the " _Company_ ").

 



 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 



 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Amalgamation Sub and the Company will amalgamate
under the laws of Bermuda (the " _Amalgamation_ ") and continue as a Bermuda
exempted limited liability company, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the amalgamation agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the " _Amalgamation Agreement_ ") and in accordance with the
Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the " _Companies Act_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Amalgamation Sub and
the Company have each adopted this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement,
authorized and approved the Amalgamation, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement,
pursuant to which each common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(" _Company Common Share_ ") and each share of Convertible Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
shares owned or held by Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
and other than Dissenting Shares, will be exchanged into shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), and
deem it fair to, advisable to and in the best interests of their respective
company to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Amalgamation and
the other transactions contemplated hereby;

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent entering into this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein and
therein, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent is entering into a Voting Agreement with a certain shareholder (the "
_Shareholder_ ") of the Company (the " _Voting Agreement_ ") pursuant to
which, among other things, the Shareholder has agreed, subject to the terms
thereof, to vote all Company Common Shares and shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock it owns in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Parent, Amalgamation Sub and
the Company intend that the Amalgamation shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("
_Treasury Regulations_ "), and, by approving resolutions authorizing this
Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, to adopt this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations; and

      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various conditions to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I.**

 



 

 **THE AMALGAMATION**

 



 

 **Section 1.1.** ** ****_The Amalgamation; Company Name_** **.** Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement, at the Effective Time, Amalgamation Sub and the
Company shall amalgamate pursuant to the Companies Act, and Amalgamation Sub
and the Company shall continue as a Bermuda exempted limited liability company
(the " _Amalgamated Company_ ") as a result of the Amalgamation. The name of
the Amalgamated Company shall be "Level 3 GC Limited".

 



 

 **Section 1.2.** ** ****_Closing_** **.** Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the
Amalgamation (the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the date that is the later
of (i) the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their terms,
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in
Article VIII and (ii) the final day of the Marketing Period or such earlier
date as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business DaysÂ’ prior
written notice to the Company, unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto (the date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP,
787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another place is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto.

 



 

 **Section 1.3.** ** ****_Effective Time_** **.** Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, as soon as practicable
following the Closing and on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the
Amalgamation to be registered by filing the Memorandum of Association and all
other documents required by the Companies Act (the " _Amalgamation
Application_ ") with the Registrar of Companies of Bermuda (the " _Registrar_
") in accordance with Section 108 of the Companies Act as evidenced by the
certificate of amalgamation. The Amalgamation shall become effective on the
date shown on the certificate of amalgamation, which shall be the Closing
Date. The effective time of the Amalgamation will be the time shown on the
certificate of amalgamation (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

 **Section 1.4.** ** ****_Effects of the Amalgamation_** **.** At the
Effective Time, the effect of the Amalgamation shall be as provided for in
Section 109 of the Companies Act. Under Section 109 of the Companies Act, from
and after the Effective Time: (i) the Amalgamation of the Company and
Amalgamation Sub and their continuance as one company shall become

 



      
 

 



 

effective; (ii) the property of each of the Company and Amalgamation Sub shall
become the property of the Amalgamated Company; (iii) the Amalgamated Company
shall continue to be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the
Company and Amalgamation Sub; (iv) any existing cause of action, claim or
liability to prosecution shall be unaffected; (v) a civil, criminal or
administrative action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or
Amalgamation Sub may be continued to be prosecuted by or against the
Amalgamated Company; and (vi) a conviction against, or ruling, order or
judgment in favor of or against, the Company or Amalgamation Sub may be
enforced by or against the Amalgamated Company.

 



 

 **Section 1.5.** ** ****_Memorandum of Association_** **.** The memorandum
of association of the Amalgamated Company shall be as set forth in the
Amalgamation Agreement (the " _Memorandum of Association_ ").

 



 

 **Section 1.6.** ** ****_Bye-laws_** **.** The bye-laws of the Amalgamated
Company shall be as set forth in the Amalgamation Agreement (the " _Bye-laws_
").

 



 

 **Section 1.7.** ** ****_Directors; Officers_** **.** From and after the
Effective Time, the directors of the Amalgamated Company shall be the
directors as set forth in the Amalgamation Agreement and the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Amalgamated Company, in each case until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal in accordance with applicable law and the Bye-laws.

 



 

 **Section 1.8.** ** ****_Effect on Share Capital_** **.** Pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof:

 



 

(a) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than any Dissenting Shares or shares owned by Parent or
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, shall be exchanged for sixteen
(16) (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock, subject to Section 2.5 with respect to fractional shares,
including the associated rights under the Rights Agreement (the "
_Amalgamation Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than any Dissenting Shares or
shares owned by Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, shall
be exchanged for fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock at
the Exchange Ratio, subject to Section 2.5 with respect to fractional shares,
including the associated rights under the Rights Agreement, plus an amount
equal to the aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends payable thereon as set
forth on _Schedule 1.8(b)_.

 



 

(c) All Company Common Shares and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (other
than shares referred to in Section 1.8(f)) shall cease to be issued and
outstanding and shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a valid certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such Company Common Share or share of Convertible
Preferred Stock (" _Certificates_ ") or holder of Company Common Shares or
shares

 



      
 

 



 

of Convertible Preferred Stock evidenced by way of entry in the register of
shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Uncertificated Company Stock_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect to such Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock, except the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration in
accordance with Article II and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Amalgamation Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $1.00 of the Amalgamated
Company.

 



 

(e) Each Company Common Share and each share of Convertible Preferred Stock
owned directly by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Company at the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Amalgamation, cease to be outstanding and shall
be canceled and retired and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Any Company Common Shares and shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock held by a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall be cancelled and exchanged for such number of shares of the Amalgamated
Company that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of issued and
outstanding shares of the Amalgamated Company as the number of Company Common
Shares and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (on an as converted basis)
held by such Company Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of issued and
outstanding Company Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common
Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by a dissenting
shareholder (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") for the purposes of Section 106 of the
Companies Act (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") shall not be exchanged for the
Amalgamation Consideration, but, instead, shall be cancelled and converted
into a right to receive payment of fair value pursuant to and subject to
Section 106 of the Companies Act; _provided_ _that_ if a Dissenting
Shareholder fails to perfect, effectively withdraws or otherwise waives or
loses such right, such Dissenting ShareholderÂ’s right to receive payment of
fair value shall be exchanged as of the Effective Time into a right to receive
the Amalgamation Consideration as provided in Section 1.8(a). The Company
shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of the existence of any Dissenting
Shareholder, including any application to the Supreme Court of Bermuda
pursuant to Section 106 of the Companies Act, attempted withdrawals or
withdrawals of applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for appraisal of
the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and any other instruments served
pursuant to the Companies Act and received by the Company relating to any
Dissenting ShareholderÂ’s rights to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting
ShareholderÂ’s Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 106 of the Companies
Act; and (ii) the opportunity and right to participate in any and all
substantive negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under the Companies Act. Except as required by the Companies Act or other
applicable law, the Company shall not (i) make any payments with respect to
any demand by the holder(s) of Dissenting Shares for appraisal of their
Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle or settle any such demands, or (iii)
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely
take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with the
Companies Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
should split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or otherwise reclassify the
Parent Common Stock, Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock, or pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common
Stock, Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, as
applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock, Company Common Shares
or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock into any other securities, or make
any other such stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of Parent or
the Company in respect of the Parent Common Stock, Company Common Shares or
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively, then any number or amount
contained herein which is based upon the price of Company Common Shares,
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock or the number of
Company Common Shares, shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or Parent Common
Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

 



 

 **Section 1.9.** ** ****_Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units_**
**.**

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase Company Common Shares issued by
the Company (each, a " _Company Option_ " and collectively, the " _Company
Options_ ") outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, whether or not then
exercisable and whether or not vested, shall be automatically exchanged, by
virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, for an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each such
option, a " _Rollover Option_ "). Each Rollover Option will be subject to, and
shall vest and remain exercisable in accordance with, the same terms and
conditions as the Company Option that it replaces, except that the exercise
price shall be divided by the Exchange Ratio and the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise shall be equal to the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _that_ any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share and the exercise price of
each Rollover Option shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock Unit_. Each restricted stock unit and performance-based
restricted stock unit covering Company Common Shares (each a " _Company RSU_
") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under any Company
Benefit Plan or otherwise, whether or not then vested, shall vest as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the performance-based
Company RSUs shall vest only to the extent provided in the applicable award
agreements, and such vested Company RSUs shall settle in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreements; provided that upon settlement, by
virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each holder of a Company RSU shall receive, in lieu of Company Common
Shares, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of
Company Common Shares otherwise issuable upon settlement of such Company RSUs
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; provided further, that any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole share. For the avoidance of doubt, any performance-
based Company RSUs that do not vest immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for no
consideration as provided in the applicable award agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary in order to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 1.9, without paying any
consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of Parent, the
Company or the Amalgamated Company, _provided_ , _that_ such resolutions and
actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be of no
effect if this Agreement is terminated.

 



 

(d) _Form S-8_. Not later than the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall file or cause to be filed all registration statements on Form S-8
or other appropriate form as may be necessary in connection with the purchase
and sale of Parent Common Stock contemplated by the Rollover Options
subsequent to the Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 1.10.** ** ****_Reorganization_** **.** This Agreement is intended
to constitute a "plan of reorganization" with respect to the Amalgamation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to which, for such purposes, the
Amalgamation is to be treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of
the Code (to which each of Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company are to be
parties under Section 368(b) of the Code).

 



 

 **ARTICLE II.**

 



 

 **EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

 **Section 2.1.** ** ****_Exchange Fund_** **.** At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or such other bank or
trust company as Parent shall determine and who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock, for exchange in accordance with Section 1.8, book-entry shares
representing the Parent Common Stock to be exchanged for outstanding Company
Common Shares and shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any
shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 



 

 **Section 2.2.** ** ****_Exchange Procedures_** **.**

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent
will send to each holder of a Certificate or holder of shares of
Uncertificated Company Stock other than Dissenting Shares (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock in
exchange for the Amalgamation Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to Company Common Shares and
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock previously held by a shareholder in
accordance with this Section 2.2, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other

 



      
 

 



 

documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, each holder of
a Certificate or Uncertificated Company Stock shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) into which the aggregate number of
Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock previously
represented by such Certificate shall have been exchanged pursuant to this
Agreement, and cash in respect of any dividends or other distributions to
which holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, if any. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.

 



 

(b) No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to
Section 2.3.

 



 

(c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock and a check in the proper amount of cash with respect
to any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued with respect to such Company Common
Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to such a transferee only if
the Certificate representing such Company Common Shares or shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 



 

 **Section 2.3.** ** ****_Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_**
**.** All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of
the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ no dividends or other
distributions declared or made in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unexchanged Certificate until the holder of such
Certificate shall exchange such Certificate in accordance with this Article
II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following exchange of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the
time of such exchange, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such exchange and a payment date subsequent to
such exchange payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock which
such shareholder is entitled to receive hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 2.4.** ** ****_No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Shares or Convertible Preferred Stock_** **. **All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon conversion of Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms

 



      
 

 



 

of Article I and this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.3) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares and shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock, respectively.

 



 

 **Section 2.5.** ** ****_No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_**
**.** No book-entry shares representing less than one share of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Certificates representing Company
Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 1.8
hereof. Any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to
Section 1.8 hereof shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

 



 

 **Section 2.6.** ** ****_Termination of Exchange Fund_** **.** Any portion
of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company
Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Amalgamated Company or
otherwise on the instruction of the Amalgamated Company, and any holders of
Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Amalgamated Company and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar laws) for the Amalgamation Consideration to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and any dividends or distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.3. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by
law, become the property of the Amalgamated Company free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 **Section 2.7.** ** ****_No Liability_** **.** None of Parent, Amalgamation
Sub, the Company, the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Amalgamation Consideration from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

 **Section 2.8.** ** ****_Lost Certificates_** **.** If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Amalgamated Company, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Amalgamated Company may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate or other documentation (including an indemnity in customary form)
reasonably requested by Parent, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Amalgamation
Consideration with respect to the Company Common Shares or shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby, and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.9.** ** ****_Withholding Rights_**. Each of the Amalgamated
Company, Parent and Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Shares, shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Convertible Preferred Stock, Company Options, or Company RSUs, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
or any provision of U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by the Amalgamated Company, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common
Shares or shares of Convertible Preferred Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Amalgamated Company, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Parent has no current intention to
withhold, or to cause the Amalgamated Company or the Exchange Agent to
withhold, any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9 and shall promptly, but in
any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Amalgamation, notify
the Company in the event that Parent determines that it, the Amalgamated
Company or the Exchange Agent is required to make any such withholdings.

 



 

 **Section 2.10.** ** ****_Further Assurances_** **.** At and after the
Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Amalgamated Company will be
authorized to execute and deliver any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do any other actions and things in each case to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Amalgamated Company any
and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Amalgamated Company as
a result of, or in connection with, the Amalgamation.

 



 

 **Section 2.11.** ** ****_Stock Transfer Books_** **.** At the close of
business, New York time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Common Shares or shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Company Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Shares or
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or
by law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be exchanged for the
Amalgamation Consideration with respect to the Company Common Shares or shares
of Convertible Preferred Stock formerly represented thereby, and any dividends
or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3.

and all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in full; (iv) the PBGC has
not instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan, and, to the Knowledge

such plan; (v) no such plan is currently, or is reasonably expected to be, in
"at-risk" status (as defined in Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or Section

the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2005 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006)
and that its trust is exempt from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and
nothing has occurred with respect to the operation of any such plan which

claims or lawsuits pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against

former employee of Parent and its Subsidiaries or with respect to any Parent
Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Parent
Benefit Plan; or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or

delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of the fully
executed Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter executed in connection with the
Financing (with certain fee amounts and certain economic terms of the "market
flex" provisions redacted, none of which such redacted fees or economic terms
would constitute Parent Financing Expenses). As of the date hereof, the
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally and general principles of equity). As of
the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any
respect and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the respective commitments therein
have not been withdrawn or terminated. There are no conditions precedent or,
to the Knowledge of Parent, other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter
(as such terms may be altered in accordance with the "market flex" provisions
set forth in the Fee Letter executed in connection with the Financing) other
than as expressly set forth as of the date hereof in the Commitment Letter. As
of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a breach by Parent or any other party
thereto under the Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of

Company in all material respects with its covenants contained in Section 5.1
and Section 7.12(h) and assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, the aggregate proceeds to be disbursed pursuant
to the agreements contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with other
financial resources of Parent, including cash on hand and marketable
securities, will, in the aggregate, be sufficient to fund the payment of any
debt required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or
otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Amalgamation as of
the date hereof (including all Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, canceled, terminated or
otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Amalgamation,
including premiums and fees incurred in

 



      
 

 



 

connection therewith (the " _Required Refinancing Indebtedness_ ")), and all
other fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Amalgamation Sub in connection
with the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby. As of
the date hereof, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
8.2, Parent has no reason to believe that either it or any other party will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis any condition of the Financing under the
Commitment Letter or any related Fee Letter or that the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date; _provided_ _that_ Parent is not making any representation or warranty
regarding the CompanyÂ’s future performance, the effect of any inaccuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement or the
failure of the Company to comply with any of its covenants in all material
respects under this Agreement. There are no other letters, agreements or
understandings (other than customary non-disclosure agreements and diligence
non-reliance letters) between Parent, on the one hand, and the Financing
Sources, on the other hand, in connection with the Financing. Parent has fully
paid all fees and expenses and other amounts required to be paid on or prior
to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Commitment Letter. Other than as
set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no fees or expenses that would
constitute Parent Financing Expenses.

 **Section 6.2. _Employee Benefits_.**

 



 

(a) For the period commencing on the Effective Time and ending on December 31,
2011, Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries who
shall have been an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Company Employee_ "), while such
Continuing Company Employee remains employed by Parent, the Amalgamated
Company, or any Subsidiary of the Amalgamated Company, shall be eligible to
either, at the sole discretion of Parent: (i) participate in ParentÂ’s employee
benefit plans and programs, including any pension plan, defined benefit plan,
defined contribution plan, bonus plan, profit sharing plan, severance plan,
medical plan, dental plan, life insurance plan, time off programs and
disability plan (excluding any equity incentive plan), in each case to the
same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries; or
(ii) continue to participate in employee benefit plans, programs and policies
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which provide benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to the benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided to such Continuing Company Employee under the Company
Benefit Plans immediately before the Closing Date; provided that neither
Parent, the Amalgamated Company, nor any Subsidiary of the Amalgamated Company
shall be required to provide any Continuing Company Employee with any type of
benefit (or any compensation in lieu thereof) that the Continuing Company
Employee receives, or becomes vested in, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that any Continuing Company Employee whose employment is
terminated within the one (1) year period commencing on the Effective Time
will be entitled to cash severance benefits that are no less favorable, and
welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate, in each case
than the cash severance benefits and welfare benefits, respectively, if any,
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan
providing for severance benefits to such Continuing Company Employee in effect
as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in which
any employees and former employees of the Company or Parent and their
Subsidiaries (the " _Participating Employees_ ") first become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which such Participating
Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "
_New Plans_ "), each Participating Employee shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, receive full credit for the years of continuous service by
such Participating Employee recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time to the same extent as if it were service with
Parent for purposes of (i) satisfying the service requirements for eligibility
to participate in each such New Plan, (ii) vesting in any benefits under each
such New Plan, and (iii) calculating the level of benefits with respect to
severance, vacation, personal days off and any other welfare-type benefits
with respect to which a Participating Employee may be eligible, where service
is a factor in calculating benefits, _provided_ _that_ , none of the foregoing
shall apply with respect to defined benefit pension plans benefit accrual or
where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to
any New Plan that is a welfare benefit plan in which any Participating
Employees first become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time,
and in which such Participating Employees did not participate prior to the
Effective Time, subject to any applicable plan provisions, contractual
requirements or laws, Parent shall, (A) cause to be waived any eligibility
requirements or pre-existing condition limitations except to the extent such
eligibility requirements or pre-existing conditions would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in which any such
Participating Employee was a participant or eligible to participate as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) give effect, in determining
any deductibles, co-insurance or maximum out of pocket limitations, to amounts
paid by such Participating Employees prior to the Effective Time under a
Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan in which any such Participating
Employee was a participant as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (to
the same extent that such credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying such
requirements during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(d) If requested by Parent at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions reasonably
necessary pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior
to the Closing Date, any defined contribution Company Benefit Plan that
contains a cash or deferred arrangement, whether intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code or otherwise (a " _Company Defined Contribution
Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company Defined
Contribution Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Board of Directors the
Company of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company Defined

 



      
 

 



 

Contribution Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be
subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2, express or implied: (i) shall be
construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, including without limitation, any Company Benefit Plan or any
Parent Benefit Plan, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any of Parent,
Amalgamation Sub, the Company, the Amalgamated Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by any of them, (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee any right to employment or continued employment for any period
of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment, or (iv) is intended to confer upon any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employee) any
right as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 6.3. _Indemnification Continuation_.**

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Section 6.3, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall mean
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time,
(x) an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (y)
serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust, and can (in the case of a person
contemplated by clause (y)) provide reasonable evidence thereof to Parent and
(ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the
Amalgamated Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to
provide indemnification to each Indemnified Person to the same extent and
under the same conditions and procedures (and subject to the same conditions,
including with respect to the advancement of expenses) as such Indemnified
Person is entitled on the date hereof under the Company Organizational
Documents (or the corresponding organizational documents of any Subsidiary of
the Company) in connection with any Proceeding based directly or indirectly
(in whole or in part) on, or arising directly or indirectly (in whole or in
part) out of, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at
the request of the Company as an officer or director of another corporation,
joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any partnership or a
trustee of any trust, whether pertaining to any matter arising before or after
the Effective Time. An Indemnified Person shall repay the Amalgamated Company
for any expenses incurred by Amalgamated Company in connection with the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 6.3 if it
is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person did not meet the
standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Amalgamated Company
as set forth in the Company Organizational Documents. The Amalgamated Company
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’ certificates of incorporation and by-laws or similar
organizational documents as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
or in any indemnification contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
any of their respective directors,

 



       
 

 



 

officers or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, in
each case in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, and the Amalgamated Company
shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the CompanyÂ’s
current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policies covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to
Indemnified Persons (provided that the Amalgamated Company may substitute
therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage
containing terms, conditions and exclusions that are not less favorable in the
aggregate to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Amalgamated Company be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.3(c) more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Amalgamated Company
would be required to expend more than 300% of current annual premiums, the
Amalgamated Company shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance
obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of current annual
premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability
insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person. If such "tail" policy
has been established by the Company, Parent shall not terminate such policy
and shall cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by it and the
Amalgamated Company.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall survive the consummation of the
Amalgamation for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit
each of the Indemnified Persons; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that any claim or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such claims.

 



 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, pay all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 6.3; _provided_ , Parent shall only be
liable for such expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person if such Indemnified
Person successfully enforces its claim in an enforcement action to enforce the
indemnity and other obligations in this Section 6.3.

 



 

 **Section 6.4.** ** ****_Notice of Breach_** **.** From and after the date
hereof and until the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX hereof, Parent shall promptly give
written notice with particularity upon having Knowledge of (i) any matter that
may constitute a material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant contained in this Agreement or (ii) the existence of any event or
circumstance that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of
any party hereto to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or that would be likely to cause the Financing not to occur.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.5.** ** ****_Bermuda Required Actions_** **.** Prior to the
Closing, Amalgamation Sub shall (and Parent, as the sole shareholder of
Amalgamation Sub shall cause Amalgamation Sub to) (i) procure that the
statutory declarations required by Section 108(3) of the Companies Act are
duly sworn by one of Amalgamation SubÂ’s officers; (ii) prepare a duly
certified copy of the shareholder resolutions evidencing the approval of
Parent, as the sole stockholder of the Amalgamation Sub, of the Amalgamation;
(iii) obtain the approval of the Registrar to the proposed name of the
Amalgamated Company; and (iv) prepare a notice advising the Registrar of the
registered office of the Amalgamated Company.

included). Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act
as soon after such filing as practicable and to keep the Registration

Governmental Entity, by promptly providing copies to the other party of any
such written communications, and of any material communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be

or any of their Subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the other party to review any

may be asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement under any Regulatory Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to agree to any terms, conditions or modifications
(including Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having
to cease operating, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or business
(including the requirement that any such assets or businesses be held

prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur any significant
expense or liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement
or agree to any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to
obtain such consents or certificates in each case, that would have a material
adverse effect on the business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. If at any point during the CFIUS review
process, CFIUS offers the parties an opportunity to withdraw and resubmit
their joint notice, and either party opts to request withdrawal and
resubmission in response to such offer by CFIUS, then the other party shall
agree to join the request for withdrawal and resubmission at the end of the
first initial 30-day review.

amalgamation, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, scheme of
arrangement, share exchange, business combination or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to
acquire, directly or indirectly, securities representing more than 20% of the

outside legal counsel and financial advisor) would be, if consummated, more
favorable to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders than this Agreement, the Amalgamation
Agreement and the Amalgamation, taking into account all terms and conditions
of such transaction (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provision and financial terms, the anticipated timing, conditions and
prospects for completion of such transaction, including the prospects for
obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and any third party approvals),
except that the reference to "20%" in the definition of "Company Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%". Reference to "this
Agreement", the "Amalgamation Agreement" and "the Amalgamation" in this
paragraph shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of
this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement or the Amalgamation that are agreed

following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.4 and which the
CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, in consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel is a Company Superior
Proposal, in each case, if and only if, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors to the CompanyÂ’s
shareholders under applicable Law and the Company complies with Section 7.4(d)
or (y) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.4 and
which the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, in
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel is a
Company Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement for the purpose of
entering into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement (a " _Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal, if, and only if, the CompanyÂ’s
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the CompanyÂ’s Board of
Directors to the CompanyÂ’s shareholders under applicable Law and the Company
complies with Section 7.4(d)

Agreement in a manner that obviates the need to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation or (ii) under Section 7.4(c)(x)(ii) or Section 7.4(c)(y) the
Company shall provide Parent with five (5) Business DaysÂ’ prior written notice
(it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the amount or
form of consideration payable in connection with the applicable Company
Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two (2)
Business Day period) advising Parent that the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors
intends to take such action, and if applicable, specifying the material terms
and conditions of the Company Superior Proposal and that the Company shall,
during such five (5) Business Day period (or subsequent two (2) Business Day
period), negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement such
that such Company Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 36
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any proposals, discussions, negotiations or inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and (iii)

the identity of the Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal or

such request for information, inquiry or proposal or discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within 36
hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of any written
documentation material to understanding such Company Acquisition Proposal
which is received by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives,
advisors or agents of such Person) making such Company Acquisition Proposal or

Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; provided,
however, that, the Company may waive any such provision in response to a
Company Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company made
under circumstances in which the Company is permitted under this Section 7.4
to participate in discussions regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal, but
only to the extent necessary to allow it to respond to such Company
Acquisition Proposal as permitted under this Section 7.4. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including

agreement (a " _Parent Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") with respect to
such Parent Superior Proposal, if, and only if, ParentÂ’s Board of Directors
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action is
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of ParentÂ’s Board of Directors to
ParentÂ’s stockholders under applicable Law and Parent complies with Section
7.4(i) and concurrently with entering into a Parent Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Parent Superior Proposal, (1) Parent terminates
this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.1(h) and (2)
Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses in accordance
with Section 9.2(g).

 



 

(i) Prior to Parent taking any action permitted (i) under Section
7.4(h)(x)(i), Parent shall provide the Company with five (5) Business DaysÂ’
prior written notice advising the Company it intends to effect a Parent Change
in Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
and, during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by the Company,
Parent engages in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend the terms
of this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need to effect a Parent Change
in Recommendation or (ii) under Section 7.4(h)(x)(ii) or Section 7.4(h)(y)
Parent shall provide the Company with five (5) Business DaysÂ’ prior written
notice (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
amount or form of consideration payable in connection with the applicable
Parent Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two
(2) Business Day period) advising the Company that ParentÂ’s Board of Directors
intends to take such action, and if applicable, specifying the material terms
and conditions of the Parent Superior Proposal and that Parent shall, during
such five (5) Business Day period (or subsequent two (2) Business Day period),
negotiate in good faith with the Company to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement such that such
Parent Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(j) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in any event within 36
hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Parent Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any proposals, discussions, negotiations or inquiries that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the
material terms and conditions of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal and the
identity of the Person making any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or with
whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place, in each case, if such
request for information, inquiry or proposal or discussions or negotiations
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. In
addition, Parent shall promptly (but in any event within 36 hours) after the
receipt thereof, provide to the Company copies of any written documentation
material to understanding such Parent Acquisition Proposal which is received
by Parent from the Person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of
such Person) making such Parent Acquisition Proposal or with whom discussions
or negotiations would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or
confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions
of any such agreement; provided, however, that, Parent may waive any such
provision in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal to the Board of

 



      
 

 



 

Directors of Parent made under circumstances in which Parent is permitted
under this Section 7.4 to participate in discussions regarding a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, but only to the extent necessary to allow it to respond
to such Parent Acquisition Proposal as permitted under this Section 7.4.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and material
details (including any amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and keep the Company reasonably informed as to the
material details of any information requested of or provided by Parent and as
to the material details of all discussions or negotiations with respect to any
such Parent Acquisition Proposal and shall provide to the Company within 36
hours after receipt thereof all copies of any other documentation material to
understanding such Parent Acquisition Proposal (as determined by Parent in
good faith) received by Parent from the Person (or from any representatives,
advisors or agents of such Person) making such Parent Acquisition Proposal or
with whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Board of
Directors of Parent shall promptly consider in good faith (in consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration
of the terms of this Agreement, the Amalgamation Agreement or the Amalgamation
proposed by the Company in response to any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent
shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained in any applicable law or otherwise cause
such restrictions not to apply.

 



 

 **Section 7.5.** ** ****_Stockholder Litigation_** **. **Each of the Company
and Parent shall keep the other party hereto informed of, and cooperate with
such party in connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against

consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to maintain in full force and
effect through the Closing Date all material insurance policies applicable to
Parent and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries,
respectively, and their respective properties and assets in effect on the date
hereof. If and as requested by Parent, the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the CompanyÂ’s insurers to waive any provisions in such
insurance policies that would allow the insurer to terminate or adversely
modify coverage upon consummation of the Amalgamation.

 



 

 **Section 7.7.** ** ****_Public Announcements_** **.** Each of the Company,
Parent and Amalgamation Sub agrees that no public release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent

applicable United States securities exchange, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final
form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent so
required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.

through the earlier of termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the Company will not adopt, approve, or agree to adopt, a rights plan,

Time shall be, applicable to the Company, the Company Common Shares, the
Convertible Preferred Stock, the Amalgamation or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.9.** ** ****_Section 16 Matters_** **.** Assuming that the
Company delivers to Parent the Company Section 16 Information (as hereinafter
defined) in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of Parent, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such

reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time
adopt a resolution providing in substance that the receipt by the Company
Insiders (as hereinafter defined) of Parent Common Stock or derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Common
Shares and derivative securities with respect to Company Common Shares and

Stock or derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement

 **Section 7.10.** ** ****_Reorganization_** **.**

 



 

(a) The parties intend that the Amalgamation qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and will report it as such
for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes. None of the parties
will knowingly take any action or fail to take any action, which action or
failure to act would cause the Amalgamation to fail to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) provide the representations referred to in Section 8.2(d)
and Section 8.3(d), respectively, as of the date of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and as of the Closing Date, (ii) obtain the opinions
referred to in Section 8.2(d) and Section 8.3(d), respectively and (iii)
obtain an opinion from Bermuda counsel that Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP,
counsel to Parent, and Latham and Watkins LLP, counsel to the Company, can rely
on and reasonably satisfactory to each of Parent and the Company regarding the
treatment of the Amalgamation as resulting in the cessation of the separate
legal status of the Company and the assets and liabilities of the Company
becoming assets and liabilities of the Amalgamated Company under Bermuda law.

 



 

 **Section 7.11.** ** ****_Parent Board of Directors_** **.** On or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall determine the number of directors that will
comprise the full Board of Directors of Parent at the Effective Time and shall
appoint to ParentÂ’s Board of Directors the number of individuals designated by
the Shareholder as determined in accordance with _Schedule 7.11_.

 



 

 **Section 7.12.** ** ****_Financing/Financing Assistance_** **.**

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter (or on revised terms that are
not materially adverse to Parent as compared to the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter and do not contain any provisions which
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede
the consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement, including any modified or additional
conditions to the closing of such Financing), including using commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter, (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter, and (iii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including after giving effect to any "market flex"
provisions set forth in the Fee Letter executed in connection with the
Financing); it being understood that the receipt of the Financing is not a
condition to ParentÂ’s or Amalgamation SubÂ’s obligation to consummate the
Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein (subject to the terms and
conditions of Section 9.1 and Section 9.2); and (iv) enforce its rights under
the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach or repudiation by any party
thereto that would reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the
Closing, including, without limitation, commencing litigation and bringing any
suit, claim, action, proceeding, arbitration, or mediation against the
Financing Sources providing Financing to seek to enforce ParentÂ’s,
Amalgamation SubÂ’s or any of their AffiliatesÂ’ rights under the Commitment
Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that (w) the third calendar
day after the final day of the Marketing Period has occurred, (x) all or any
portion of the Financing (other than any bridge financing) has not been
consummated, (y) all conditions contained in Article VIII shall have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at Closing _provided_ _that_ such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied at Closing) and (z) the bridge facilities
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the proceeds thereof are available
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, then Parent
shall cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used in lieu of such
unavailable Financing at the Closing. Parent shall not,

 



      
 

 



 

and shall not permit Amalgamation Sub to, agree to or permit any amendment,
replacements, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
material rights under, the Commitment Letter without the CompanyÂ’s prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed); _provided_ _that_ Parent may (x) enter into any amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Commitment Letter (other than any modified or additional conditions to the
closing of such Financing or any reduction in the aggregate amount of the
Financing contemplated thereunder) that does not contain any provisions that
would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede
the consummation of the Financing or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement; and (y) amend the Commitment Letter
to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar
entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement so long as any such addition would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially hinder or materially delay the consummation of the
Financing or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Amalgamation Agreement or the availability of the Financing under the
Commitment Letter. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall willfully
take any action intended to materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing.

 



 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letter
(including after giving effect to the "market flex" provisions set forth in
the Fee Letter executed in connection with the Financing) for any reason,
Parent shall, in consultation with the Company, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient
to fund the payment of the Required Refinancing Indebtedness including
premiums and fees incurred in connection therewith which would not involve
terms that are less favorable in any material respect to Parent and which
would not contain any provisions that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation Agreement,
including any conditions to the closing of such Financing that are materially
less favorable to Parent than the conditions to closing in the Commitment
Letter (as defined immediately prior to such Alternative Financing). If an
Alternative Financing is required in accordance with this Section 7.12(b),
Parent shall obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a
new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing, and
Parent shall comply with its covenants in Section 7.12(a) with respect to the
Commitment Letter (as defined immediately after receipt of such Alternative
Financing).

 



 

(c) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any material breach
or repudiation (or any threatened breach delivered in writing that would be
reasonably likely to materially impede or delay the Closing) by any party of
the Commitment Letter of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the
Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and
consummate the Financing. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent
and the Company will consult with each other in good faith, and upon mutual
agreement, Parent will request that the Financing Sources confirm (a) their
intent and ability to perform, and the availability of the Financing, under
the Commitment Letter, subject only to satisfaction or waiver

 



      
 

 



 

of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, and (b) that they are
not aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any condition set forth in the Commitment Letter.

 



 

(d) At the request and expense of Parent, the Company shall, at a time
reasonably requested by Parent, (i) promptly commence an offer to purchase
with respect to any and all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the CompanyÂ’s Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes and to promptly cause the
GCUK Issuers to promptly commence an offer to purchase with respect to any and
all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the GCUK Senior Notes, in
each case for cash on price terms that are reasonably acceptable to Parent to
be consummated substantially simultaneously with the Closing using funds
provided by Parent (the " _Offers to Purchase_ "), and (ii) solicit the
consent of the holders of each series of Notes regarding certain proposed
amendments to the indenture governing such series of Notes (the " _Indenture
Amendments_ ") as reasonably requested by Parent and as set forth in the
tender offer and consent solicitation documents sent to holders of such series
of Notes, which amendments may include the elimination of all or substantially
all of the restrictive covenants and certain other provisions contained in the
indenture governing such series of Notes that can be eliminated upon the
favorable vote of the holders of a majority of the principal amount thereof
(the " _Consent Solicitations_ " and, together with the Offers to Purchase,
the " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), and Parent shall assist the Company in
connection therewith. The Debt Tender Offer shall be made on customary terms
and conditions and such other terms and conditions that are reasonably
proposed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company; _provided_ that,
in any event, Parent and the Company hereby agree that (i) the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offer shall provide that the closing thereof
shall be contingent upon the consummation of the Amalgamation at the Effective
Time; (ii) the Indenture Amendments shall not require the consent of the
holders of more than a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the
applicable series of Notes in the aggregate, (iii) tendering of the applicable
series of Notes pursuant to the Debt Tender Offer shall constitute the grant
of a consent to the Indenture Amendments and (iv) promptly upon expiration of
the Consent Solicitations, assuming the requisite consents have been received
with respect to such series of Notes, the Company or GCUK Issuers, as
applicable, shall execute a supplemental indenture to the indentures governing
each series of Notes that will become operative only immediately upon the
Effective Time and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
trustee under each such indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture
prior to or substantially simultaneously with the Closing. Concurrent with the
Effective Time, and in accordance with the terms of the Debt Tender Offer, the
Amalgamated Company shall accept for purchase and purchase each series of
Notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Debt Tender Offer
using funds provided by or at the direction of Parent. Parent hereby covenants
and agrees to provide (or to cause to be provided) immediately available funds
to the Company and the GCUK Issuers for the full payment at the Effective Time
of all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn to the extent required
pursuant to the terms of the Debt Tender Offer.

 



 

(e) Upon the request of Parent pursuant to Section 7.12(d), the Company shall
promptly prepare an offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement with
respect to the Debt Tender Offer with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Notes, and the GCUK Issuers shall promptly prepare an offer to
purchase and consent solicitation statement with respect to the Debt Tender
Offer with respect to the GCUK Senior Notes, and in each case the related

 



      
 

 



 

letter of transmittal and consent and forms of other related letters and
summary advertisement, as well as all other information and exhibits that may
be necessary or advisable in connection with the Debt Tender Offer
(collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company will cause the Offer
Documents to be mailed to the holders of the applicable series of Senior
Secured Notes and/or Senior Notes and GCUK Issuers will cause the Offer
Documents to be mailed to the holders of the GCUK Senior Notes, as applicable,
promptly following the commencement of the Debt Tender Offer in accordance
with Section 7.12(d); provided, however, that all mailings to the holders of
the applicable series of Notes in connection with the Debt Tender Offer and
all press releases issued by the Company or the GCUK Issuers with respect to
the Debt Tender Offer (including any press release that purports to announce,
modify or amend the terms of the Debt Tender Offer) shall be subject to the
prior review, comment and approval of Parent, which review, comment and
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof,
the Company and the GCUK Issuers will have the right to (i) amend the Offer
Documents without ParentÂ’s review, comment or approval and/or (ii) terminate
the Debt Tender Offer.

 



 

(f) Alternatively, if Parent determines instead that it or one of its
Subsidiaries shall make the Debt Tender Offer, at ParentÂ’s expense, the
Company shall provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
necessary or reasonably required in connection with the Debt Tender Offer,
including, without limitation, executing (or causing the GCUK Issuers to
execute) supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of
Notes that will become operative only immediately upon the Effective Time,
using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee under each such
indenture to enter such supplemental indenture prior or substantially
simultaneously with the Closing, and providing the information necessary to
distribute the applicable Offer Documents to the holders of the applicable
series of Notes.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
7.12(g), neither the Company nor the GCUK Issuers shall be required to take
any action in connection with the Debt Tender Offer that it believes, after
consultation with counsel, (i) could reasonably be expected to cause the
Company or such GCUK Issuer to violate (A) federal or state securities laws or
(B) the provisions of the indentures governing the applicable series of Notes
or (ii) would reasonably be expected to cause the Company or such GCUK Issuer
to materially violate the provisions of any other material contract of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or of the GCUK Issuers and their subsidiaries.

 



 

(h) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent and Amalgamation
Sub, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers, employees, agents and
representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and
Amalgamation Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
necessary or reasonably required in connection with the Financing, including
the following: (i) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
CompanyÂ’s and its Subsidiaries senior officers and other representatives to
participate in meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), drafting sessions and sessions
with rating agencies on reasonable advance notice to the extent practicable;
(ii) assisting with the preparation of appropriate and customary materials for
rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda
and similar documents reasonably required in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that any such marketing materials
shall reflect that one or more of Parent and its Subsidiaries will be the
obligors at Closing and that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no
obligations thereunder unless and until the Effective Time occurs; (iii) using
its commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the preparation of any
pledge and security documents, any loan agreement, currency or interest
hedging agreement, other definitive financing documents on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent and usual and customary for transactions
of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letter, _provided_ _that_ no
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such document
or agreement shall be effective until the Effective Time; (iv) using
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral,
_provided_ _that_ no pledge shall be effective until the Effective Time; (v)
using commercially reasonable efforts to furnish on a confidential basis to
Parent and Amalgamation Sub and the Financing Sources, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including all
financial statements and other financial data reasonably required by the
Commitment Letter; ** ** (vi) providing monthly financial statements
(excluding footnotes) to the extent the Company customarily prepares such
financial statements within the time such statements are customarily prepared;
(vii) executing and delivering (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its advisors), and causing its Subsidiaries to execute and deliver (or
use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its advisors), customary
certificates, accounting comfort letters (including consents of accountants
for use of their audit reports in any financial statements relating to the
Financing), legal opinions or other documents and instruments relating to
guarantees and other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent as necessary and customary in connection with the
Financing, (viii) providing audited consolidated financial statements of the
Company covering the three (3) fiscal years immediately preceding the Closing
for which audited consolidated financial statements are then currently
available, unaudited financial statements (excluding footnotes) for any
regular quarterly interim fiscal period or periods of the Company ended after
the date of the most recent audited financial statements and at least 45 days
prior to the Closing Date (within 45 days after the end of each such period),
and (ix) requesting that its independent accountants cooperate with and assist
Parent in preparing customary and appropriate information packages and
offering materials as the parties to the Commitment Letter may reasonably
request for use in connection with the offering and/or syndication of debt
securities, loan participations and other matters contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, in obtaining third party consents in connection with such
financing, and in extinguishing Existing Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and releasing liens securing such indebtedness, in each case to
take effect at the Effective Time; _provided_ _that_ except as provided in
Section 9.2 with respect to the payment by the Company of the Parent Financing
Expenses, until the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall (A) be required to pay any fees, expenses or other amounts
in connection with the Financing, (B) have any liability or obligation under
any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document
related to the Financing or (C) be required to incur any liability in
connection with the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the cooperation and actions required by the
Company pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall not be required to be taken if any
such cooperation or act (x) causes any representations or warranties of the
Company in this Agreement to be breached, or (y) otherwise causes a breach of
this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall any
failure of the Company to provide any required cooperation or take any
required action pursuant to this Section

 



      
 

 



 

7.12 be deemed to have caused any condition to Closing set forth in Article
VIII to fail to be satisfied, other than an intentional and material failure
of the Company to provide such cooperation or take material action. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Board of Directors of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, in each case as constituted prior to the Effective Time, shall
not be required to adopt any resolutions or take any other action in
connection with the authorization of any of the Financing other than to
approve regulatory filings relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection therewith.

 



 

(i) All material non-public information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries provided to Parent, Amalgamation Sub and their respective
representatives pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall be kept confidential by
them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company hereby
consents to the use of all of its and its SubsidiariesÂ’ logos in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ _that_ such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to nor is reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the reputation or goodwill of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their assets, including their logos and
marks.

 



 

(j) Parent shall, promptly upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including without limitation professional fees and expenses of accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors) to the extent such costs are incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation provided by
the Company, its Subsidiaries, their respective officers, employees and other
representatives pursuant to the terms of Section 7.12(h), or in connection
with compliance with its obligations under Section 7.12(h), and Parent hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective officers, employees, agents and representatives from and
against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries but including violation of the Confidentiality
Agreement) and any misuse of the logos or marks of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except (i) in the event such liabilities or losses arose out of
or result from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective representatives or (ii) as provided in Section 9.2
with respect to the CompanyÂ’s payment of the Parent Financing Expenses.
