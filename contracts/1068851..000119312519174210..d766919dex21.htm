ARTICLE I

ACQUISITION OF LEGACY BY PROSPERITY

Section 1.01 _Merger of Legacy with and into Prosperity_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, Legacy will merge with and into Prosperity
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Texas Business
Organizations Code (the " _TBOC_ ") and the Maryland General Corporation Law
(the " _MGCL_ "). 

Section 1.02 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the TBOC and the MGCL. After the
Merger, Prosperity shall be the Resulting Corporation and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Texas, and the separate
corporate existence of Legacy shall cease. The name of the
Resulting Corporation shall be "Prosperity Bancshares, Inc." The existing
principal place of business of Prosperity immediately preceding the Merger
shall be the principal place of business of the Resulting Corporation after
the Merger. At the Effective Time, all rights, title and interests to all
real estate and other property owned by Legacy shall be allocated to and
vested in the Resulting Corporation without reversion or impairment, without
further act or deed, and without any transfer or assignment having occurred,
but subject to any existing liens or encumbrances thereon. At the Effective
Time, all liabilities and obligations of Legacy shall be allocated to the
Resulting Corporation, and the Resulting Corporation shall be the primary
obligor therefor.

Section 1.03 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. As a result of the
Merger, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Prosperity shall continue in
effect as the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Resulting
Corporation until the same shall be amended and changed as provided by
applicable Law.

Section 1.05 _Conversion of Legacy Shares_. At the Effective Time by virtue
of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Prosperity, Legacy or
the holder of any of the following securities:

(A) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Legacy (such
shares, the " _Legacy Shares_ ") issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, excluding any Cancelled Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive: (i) 0.5280 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Prosperity (the "
_Prosperity Shares_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with Section
1.05(C); and (ii) $6.28 in cash, without interest (" _Per Share Cash
Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(B) All Legacy Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are owned directly by Prosperity or Legacy, including any
Legacy Shares held in the treasury of Legacy (in each case, other than Legacy
Shares: (i) held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the
like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that
are beneficially owned by third parties; or (ii) held, directly or
indirectly, by Prosperity or Legacy in respect of a debt previously
contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no Merger
Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor
(such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

(C) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Prosperity
will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional Prosperity
Shares otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of
any such fractional shares, Prosperity shall pay to each former holder of
Legacy Shares otherwise entitled to receive such fractional share an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the
average of the closing-sale prices of Prosperity Shares on the New York Stock
Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the five full
trading days ending on the trading day preceding the Closing Date (the "
_Prosperity Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction (rounded to the
nearest thousandths when expressed in decimal form) of a Prosperity Share
which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.05.

 

Section 1.06 _Treatment of Legacy Equity Awards_.

 

(A) _Legacy Options_. At the Effective Time, each Legacy Option, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect
to a number of Legacy Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the quotient of: (i) the product of (a) the number of Legacy Shares
subject to such Legacy Option _multiplied by_ (b) the excess, if any, of (I)
the sum of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share
Cash Consideration over (II) the exercise price per share, _divided by_ (ii)
the sum of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration. Prosperity shall issue the consideration described in
this Section 1.06(A), less applicable tax withholdings, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time. Any applicable tax withholdings shall
first be applied to reduce the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect
of the holders Legacy Options and to the extent applicable tax withholdings
exceed the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holders
Legacy Options, the balance of the applicable tax withholdings shall be
applied to reduce the number of Prosperity Shares payable in respect of the
holders Legacy Options based on the Prosperity Share Closing Price. Any
Legacy Option that has an exercise price per Legacy Share that is greater than
or equal to the sum of (x) Per Share Stock Consideration _plus_ (y) the Per
Share Cash Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration.

 



-3- 

    

(B) _Legacy RSAs_. At the Effective Time, each unvested Legacy RSA that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, consistent with
the terms of the applicable Legacy Equity Plan shall vest (notwithstanding any
provision in any award agreement to the contrary) and be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 1.05(A) in respect of each
vested Legacy Share subject to such Legacy Equity Plan, which for any Legacy
RSA subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria shall be calculated
assuming satisfaction of such criteria at target performance levels set forth
in the applicable award agreement. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Prosperity shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Legacy RSAs to the holders thereof.
Any applicable tax withholdings shall first be applied to reduce the Per Share
Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holders Legacy RSAs and to the
extent applicable tax withholdings exceed the Per Share Cash
Consideration payable in respect of the holders Legacy RSAs, the balance of
the applicable tax withholdings shall be applied to reduce the number of
Prosperity Shares payable in respect of the holders Legacy RSAs based on the
Prosperity Share Closing Price.

(C) _Legacy PSAs_. At the Effective Time, each unvested Legacy PSA that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, consistent with
the terms of the Legacy 2017 Equity Plan shall vest (notwithstanding any
provision in any award agreement to the contrary) and be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 1.05(A) in respect of each
vested Legacy Share subject to such Legacy PSA, which for any Legacy PSA
subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria shall be calculated
assuming satisfaction of such criteria at target performance levels set forth
in the applicable award agreement. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Prosperity shall deliver or cause to be delivered the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such Legacy PSAs to the holders thereof.
Any applicable tax withholdings shall first be applied to reduce the Per
Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holders Legacy PSAs and to
the extent applicable tax withholdings exceed the Per Share Cash Consideration
payable in respect of the holders Legacy PSAs, the balance of the applicable
tax withholdings shall be applied to reduce the number of Prosperity Shares
payable in respect of the holders Legacy PSAs based on the Prosperity Share
Closing Price.

appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and take such other

the Legacy Board, after consultation with its outside counsel and financial

Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Cash Consideration and/or any dependent items,
to provide to the Legacy stockholders the same economic effect as

Section 2.04 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(A) On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Prosperity
shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust with Computershare Investor
Services, Inc. or another bank or trust company mutually agreeable to
Prosperity and Legacy (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of the Legacy Shares: (i) certificates for shares or, at Prosperitys
option, evidence of shares in book entry form, including via the direct
registration system (collectively, referred to herein as "certificates")
representing the aggregate number of Prosperity Shares which the holders
of Legacy Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.05; and (ii) a
cash amount sufficient to pay: (a) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration; and (b) any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.05(C) (such Prosperity Shares and cash described in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b), the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(B) The Resulting Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in no event more than 10 Business Days after the Effective Time, to
each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates representing
Legacy Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ," it being understood that
any reference herein to "Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to
book-entry accounts relating to the ownership of Legacy Shares), a form letter
of transmittal which will specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Prosperity
shall provide a draft of the form of letter of transmittal to Legacy no later
than 10 days prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of the letter
of transmittal and any associated cover letter shall be mutually acceptable to
Prosperity and Legacy before such transmittal materials are mailed to the
holders of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal properly completed and
duly executed (the " _Transmittal Materials_ "), such Certificate shall
forthwith be canceled and the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor: (i) a certificate representing that number of
Prosperity Shares equal to the product (rounded down to a whole Prosperity
Share) of (a) the Exchange Ratio, multiplied by (b) the number of Legacy
Shares represented by such Certificate; and (ii) a check representing an
amount of cash equal to the sum of (a) the product of (I) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, multiplied by (II) the number of Legacy Shares represented by
such Certificate; plus (b) the amount of cash as the payment in lieu of the
issuance of fractional Prosperity Shares calculated in accordance
with Section 1.05(C). Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.04,
each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled Shares) shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Resulting
Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent to review the Transmittal Materials promptly after receipt of the
Transmittal Materials in order to verify proper completion and execution
thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and the surrender of
a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with properly completed and
executed Transmittal Materials, the Resulting Corporation will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the
Merger Consideration as soon as practicable.

 



-12- 

    

(C) After the Effective Time, the share transfer ledger of Legacy shall be
closed and there shall be no transfers on the share transfer books of Legacy
of the Legacy Shares which were outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Resulting Corporation, they shall be presented to the Exchange Agent and
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.04 as soon as practicable.

(D) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Prosperity Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall be
paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder surrenders such
Certificate to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.04, and
such Certificate has been accepted for surrender by the Exchange Agent;
_provided_ that thereafter, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive
any such dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which
had become payable after the Effective Time with respect to the Prosperity
Shares represented by such Certificate.

(E) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Legacy for 12 months after the Exchange Agent first mails the
letter of transmittal pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be delivered to the
Resulting Corporation upon demand, and any stockholders of Legacy who have
not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures in this Section 2.04
shall look to the Resulting Corporation only, and not the Exchange Agent, for
the payment of the Merger Consideration. If outstanding Certificates for
Legacy Shares are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed
before the date on which such Prosperity Shares or cash would otherwise
escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property escheat or any other applicable Law,
become the property of the Resulting Corporation (and to the extent not in its
possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled to such property.

(F) If any Prosperity Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in
which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably satisfactory
to the Resulting Corporation) for transfer, and that the Person requesting
such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
Prosperity Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not payable. The Exchange Agent, Prosperity or the Resulting Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of the Merger
Consideration or other consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts
as the Exchange Agent, Prosperity or the Resulting Corporation, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent that the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent,
Prosperity or the Resulting Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Legacy Shares, Legacy RSAs, Legacy PSAs or Legacy
Options in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the
Exchange Agent, Prosperity or the Resulting Corporation, as the case may be.

 



-13- 

    

(G) None of Prosperity, the Resulting Corporation, Legacy, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Legacy Shares for
any Prosperity Share (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

(H) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Prosperity, the Resulting
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as Prosperity, the Resulting Corporation or the Exchange Agent
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Prosperity, the Resulting Corporation or Legacy with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

guaranteed by any Governmental Authority, including the Small Business
Administration, each of such loans was made in material compliance and
conformity with all relevant Laws and procedures such that such Governmental
Authoritys guaranty of such loan is effective during the term of such loan in
all material respects. The allowance for loan and lease losses (the "
_Allowance_ ") as reflected in the Legacy SEC Reports, and as of each quarter
ended after December 31, 2018, was determined in accordance with GAAP and
Legacy Banks existing methodology for determining the adequacy of the
Allowance, such methodology, in the reasonable opinion of Legacy Banks
management, being consistent with the standards established by applicable
Governmental Authorities and the Financial Accounting Standards Board and in
conformance with recommendations and comments in reports of examination in
all material respects. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in

for any reason, including age, gender, race, religion or other legally

Commission or any other Governmental Authority that would reasonably be
expected to result in liability to Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary. There are
no unfair labor practice complaints pending against Legacy or any Legacy
Subsidiary before the National Labor Relations Board and no similar claims
pending before any other Governmental Authority. There is no activity or
proceeding of any labor organization (or representative thereof) or employee
group to organize any employees of Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary, nor of any
strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts or threats thereof, by or with
respect to any such employees. Legacy and each Legacy Subsidiary is in
compliance in all material respects with applicable Law respecting employment
and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours, and neither Legacy nor any Legacy Subsidiary is engaged in any unfair
labor practice. Each individual who renders services to Legacy or any of its
Subsidiaries who is classified by Legacy or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
as having the status of an independent contractor, consultant or other non-

"), any contracts with independent contractors (including actuaries and
investment managers) that relate to any Employee Plan, the Form 5500 filed
with the IRS in each of the two most recent plan years with respect to each
Employee Plan, and related schedules and opinions, the most recently received
IRS determination letter or opinion letter, if applicable, and such other
documents, records or other materials related thereto, as reasonably requested
by Prosperity.

 

(C) No Employee Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Sections 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. Neither Legacy, its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the preceding
six years, contributed to, been obligated to contribute to or had any
liability (including any contingent liability) with respect to
any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or
a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA.
No liability: (i) under Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA; (ii) under Sections
412, 430 or 4971 of the Code; (iii) as a result of a failure to comply with
the continuation coverage requirements of § 601 _et seq._ of ERISA and §
4980B of the Code or similar state law; or (iv) under corresponding or similar
provisions of foreign laws or regulations has been incurred by Legacy, its
Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA Affiliates or their
respective predecessors that has not been satisfied in full, and there does
not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be
expected to result in, any such liability of Legacy, its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates. There have been no prohibited
transactions (described under ERISA § 406 or Code § 4975(c)), breaches of
fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any Law applicable to
the Employee Plans and related Funding Arrangements that would reasonably be
expected to subject Prosperity, Prosperity Bank, Legacy or any Legacy
Subsidiary to any material taxes, penalties or other liabilities. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean, with respect to any
entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or business that is, or was
at the relevant time, a member of a group described in Section 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or
included the first entity, trade or business, or that is, or was at the
relevant time, a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity,
trade or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

 

(D) Each Employee Plan that is represented to be qualified under Code § 401(a)
either has a current favorable determination letter from the IRS or is an
adoption of a prototype or volume submitter plan for which a favorable opinion
letter has been issued by the IRS, on which Legacy or a Legacy Subsidiary is
entitled to reliance equivalent to a determination letter, and there are
no existing circumstances, and no events have occurred that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Employee Plan
or the related Funding Arrangement. All reports, descriptions and filings
required by the Code, ERISA or any Governmental Authority with respect to
each Employee Plan have been timely and completely

 



-30- 

    

 filed or distributed. Each Employee Plan has been operated in material
compliance with applicable Law and in accordance with its terms. All
contributions (including all employer contributions, employee salary
reduction contributions and all premiums or other payments (other than
claims)) that are due have been made with respect to each Employee Plan.

 

(E) There are no pending claims, lawsuits or actions relating to any Employee
Plan (other than ordinary course claims for benefits) and, to the Best
Knowledge of Legacy, none are threatened, and no set of circumstances exists
that would reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Employee
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Plans that
would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Legacy or
any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any participant in
an Employee Plan or any other Person. No Employee Plan is under audit or the
subject of an investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or, to the Best
Knowledge of Legacy, threatened.

 

(F) Neither Legacy nor any Legacy Subsidiary has any liability for providing
health, medical, death or other welfare benefits to any current or former
employees, directors or other service providers (or their dependents or
beneficiaries) after retirement or other termination of employment or service
(other than for continuation coverage required under Code §4980B or applicable
state Law, the cost of which is borne by the covered individuals), and no
written or, to the Best Knowledge of Legacy, oral representations have been
made by Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary to any such individual promising or
guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for any such coverage.

(G) There are no material surrender charges, penalties, or other costs or fees
that would reasonably be expected to be imposed by any Person against Legacy,
any Legacy Subsidiary, an Employee Plan, or any other Person, including an
Employee Plan participant or beneficiary, as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to any
insurance, annuity or investment contracts or other similar investment held by
any Employee Plan.

 

(H) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined under Section 409A of the Code) is in documentary compliance with,
and has been operated and administered in compliance with, Section 409A of the
Code and the guidance provided thereunder.

 

(I) Except as otherwise set forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.27(I)_ , neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event): (i) result in, cause the vesting, funding, exercisability or
delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right
or other benefit to any current or former employee, officer, director or
other service provider of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) cause Legacy
or any of its Subsidiaries to transfer or set aside any assets to fund any
benefits under any Employee Plan; or (iii) result in any limitation on the
right of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, or terminate any
Employee Plan or transfer or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee
Plan or related trust. Except as 

 



-31- 

    

 otherwise set forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.27(I)_ , without limiting
the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no amount paid or
payable (whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits,
acceleration of vesting or otherwise) by Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with
any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
section 280G of the Code. Copies of Legacys section 280G calculations in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby are included in
_Confidential Schedule 3.27(I)_.

(J) No Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement to
any service provider for any taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code or
otherwise.

(K) The Legacy ESOP, its related trust (the " _Legacy ESOP Trust_ "), and the
trustee of the Legacy ESOP Trust have been duly authorized and established by
all necessary corporate action on the part of Legacy Bank and in accordance
with applicable laws, regulations, and rulings. The Legacy ESOP Trust is a
trust duly formed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized. The Legacy ESOP is and has been at all times since its
inception, in form, an "employee stock ownership plan" within the meaning of
Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code and Section 407(d)(6) of ERISA, which, in form,
qualifies under Section 401(a) of the Code. The Legacy ESOP Trust is now, and
has at all times since inception been, qualified under Section 501(a) of the
Code. The Legacy Shares held by the Legacy ESOP Trust have constituted and
constitute "employer securities," as defined in Section 409(l) of the Code,
and "qualified employer securities," as defined in Section 407(d)(5) of
ERISA. As of the Closing, neither Legacy Bank nor any participant in the
Legacy ESOP is or may be subject to liability by reason of Section 4979A of
the Code. Except as set forth in _Confidential Schedule_ __ _ 3.27(K)_, (i)
the Legacy Shares held by the Legacy ESOP are owned of record and beneficially
by the Legacy ESOP, free and clear of all Liens, and (ii) there are no
liabilities or existing indebtedness of the Legacy ESOP other than the
obligation to pay the benefits to the Legacy ESOP participants under the
Legacy ESOP in the ordinary course. No Legacy Shares were acquired by the
Legacy ESOP in a transaction pursuant to Section 1042 of the Code.
All employer contributions to the Legacy ESOP were deductible under Section
404 of the Code for the year made. Legacy Bank and the Legacy ESOP have, at
all times, complied with the voting requirements of Section 409(e) of the
Code. There is no judgment, decree or order against the Legacy ESOP trustee,
the Legacy ESOP Trust or the Legacy ESOP that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or that would reasonably be expected to
materially interfere with the ability of Legacy or Legacy Bank to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

made in compliance in all material respects with all applicable statutes and
regulatory requirements at the time of such loan or any renewal thereof,
including Regulation Z (12 C.F.R. § 1026 et seq.) issued by the Bureau of

MGCL and any other applicable Takeover Statute.

Legacy Board has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered orally, has
been or will be confirmed in writing, dated the same date) from J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the factors,
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, as of the date
thereof, the Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Legacy Shares
in the Merger, is fair to such holders from a financial point of view. As of
the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been amended or rescinded.

Section 3.33 _Investment Securities_.

 

(A) Each of Legacy and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all
securities owned by it in all material respects (except securities sold under
repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity) free and
clear of any Lien, except to the extent that such securities are pledged in
the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent practices to
secure obligations of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries and except for such
defects in title or Liens that would not be material to Legacy and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such securities are valued on the books of
Legacy and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects.

(B) Legacy and each of its Subsidiaries employs investment, securities risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures that Legacy and each
such Subsidiary believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of such
businesses, and Legacy and its Subsidiaries have, since January 1, 2016, been
in material compliance with such policies, practices and procedures in all
material respects.

Legacy Subsidiary is a party to nor has it agreed to enter into an exchange
traded or over-the-counter equity, interest rate, foreign exchange or other
swap, forward, future, option, cap, floor or collar or any other contract
that is a derivatives contract (including various combinations thereof), other
than those entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with applicable Laws and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible, all of which are legal, valid and binding obligations of Legacy
or its applicable Subsidiary, enforceable against Legacy or such Subsidiary in
accordance with their respective terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, conservatorship, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, receivership or similar Laws and judicial
decisions affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity),
and Legacy and its applicable Subsidiaries and, to Legacys Best Knowledge,
each counterparty thereto, have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder.

Section 3.35 _Indemnification_. To the Best Knowledge of Legacy, no action or
failure to take action by any present or former director, officer, employee
or agent of Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise
to a material claim by any such individual for indemnification from Legacy or
any Legacy Subsidiary.

 

Section 3.36 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither Legacy nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any responsibility or liability for any fees, expenses or commissions
payable to any agent, representative, finder, financial advisor or broker in

copy of which has been made available to Prosperity.

Section 3.37 _Data Processing Agreements_. Legacy Bank obtains its data
processing services, ATM, and other information technology services
exclusively through the contracts or agreements with the persons or entities
described in _Confidential Schedule 3.37_ (" _DP Contracts_ "). A true and

Section 3.38 _Zoning and Related Laws_. All Properties owned or operated by
Legacy Bank and the use thereof is in compliance with applicable Law,
including building, zoning and other Laws, except where the failure, whether
individually or in the aggregate, to be so in compliance would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change in Legacy.

Section 3.39 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Legacy has one special purpose
trust subsidiary, Legacy Capital Trust III (" _Legacy Trust III_ "). With
respect to Legacy Trust III:

(A) It has issued and sold preferred securities (the " _Legacy Trust III
Preferred Securities_ ") and common securities (the " _Legacy Trust III Common
Securities_ ") under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust (the "
_Legacy III Trust Agreement_ ") and Legacy has issued to Legacy Trust III
Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (the " _Debentures_ "), under

 



-34- 

    

 an Indenture (Legacy Trust IIIs Indenture and the Legacy III Trust
Agreement are collectively referred to as the " _Operative Documents_ ").
_Confidential Schedule 3.39 _ sets forth, with respect to Legacy Trust III,
the: (i) dates of the respective Operative Documents; (ii) aggregate
liquidation value of the Legacy Trust III Preferred Securities and Legacy
Trust III Common Securities (together, the " _Trust Securities_ "); (iii)
aggregate amount of Debentures that have been issued to Legacy Trust III by
Legacy; (iv) the rate paid on the Trust Securities and the Debentures
(collectively, the " _Securities_ "); (v) the dates after which Legacy may
redeem the Debentures at par; and (vi) the maturity date of the Debentures.

 

(B) It has been duly created and is validly existing in good standing as a
statutory trust under the Laws of the State of Delaware with the power and
authority to own property and to conduct the business it transacts and
proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its obligations under the
Operative Documents. It is not a party to or otherwise bound by any material
agreement other than the Operative Documents and a Placement Agreement of
even date with the Legacy III Trust Agreement. It is and will be classified
for tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a
corporation.

 

(C) The Trust Securities have been duly authorized by the Legacy Trust III
Agreement, have been validly issued and represent undivided beneficial
interests in the assets of the Legacy Trust III. None of the Trust Securities
is subject to preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding
Legacy Trust III Common Securities are directly owned by Legacy free and clear
of any Lien and have been issued in compliance with applicable securities
Laws. The Legacy III Common Securities satisfy the eligibility requirements of
Rule 144A(d)(3) issued under the Securities Act. Neither Legacy nor the Legacy
Trust III is an "investment company" or an entity "controlled" by an
"investment company," in each case within the meaning of Section 3(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, without regard to Section 3(c)
of that act. The Debentures are not held of record by stockholders of Legacy
or any Legacy Subsidiary.

(D) The sole assets of the Legacy Trust III are its Debentures, any interest
paid on such Debentures to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such
Debentures, or any of the foregoing.

 

(E) All of the proceeds from the sale of the Legacy Trust III Preferred
Securities issued by the Legacy Trust III have been invested in
its Debentures. All of the proceeds from the sale of the Legacy Trust III
Common Securities issued by the Legacy Trust III have been invested in the
Debentures. All Debentures are and have been held by Legacy Trust III since
their initial issuance.

 

(F) It was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any trade or
business and it has not conducted any trade or business since it was formed.
It exists for the exclusive purposes of: (i) issuing and selling the Legacy
Trust III Preferred Securities and the Legacy Trust III Common Securities;
(ii) using the proceeds from the sale of the Legacy Trust III
Preferred Securities and the Legacy Trust III Common Securities to acquire
its Debentures; and (iii) engaging only in activities necessary, advisable or
incidental thereto. Legacy Trust III was formed to facilitate direct
investment in its assets, and the existence of multiple classes of ownership
is incidental to that purpose. There is no intent to provide holders of such
interests in Legacy Trust III with diverse interests in the assets of Legacy
Trust III.

 



-35- 

    

(G) Since January 1, 2016, Legacy has not exercised its right to defer
interest payments on the Debentures.

(H) Its income consists solely of payments made by Legacy with respect to the
Debentures, and such payments are not derived from the active conduct of a
financial business by it. Both Legacys obligation to make those payments and
the amounts thereof are set forth in the Debentures. Neither Legacys
obligation to make those payments nor the amounts payable by Legacy is
dependent on income or profits of Legacy or any Affiliate of Legacy (although
Legacys ability to do so is so dependent).

 

(I) Legacy has not issued any class of capital shares either pari passu or
senior to the Debentures. All Debentures are either pari passu or senior to
Legacys trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business.

(J) Legacy and Legacy Trust III have created a debtor-creditor relationship
between Legacy, as debtor, and Legacy Trust III, as a creditor, and Legacy and
Legacy Trust III have treated the Debentures as indebtedness for all tax
purposes.

 

Section 3.40 _No Investment Advisory Subsidiary_. None of Legacy nor any
Legacy Subsidiary serves as an investment advisor (or an investment sub-
advisor) to a registered investment company.

Section 3.41 _No Broker-Dealer Subsidiary_. Neither Legacy nor any Legacy
Subsidiary is a broker-dealer required to be registered under the Exchange Act
with the SEC. Neither Legacy nor any Legacy Subsidiary is subject to Section
9(c) or 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Section 3.42 _Title Company Subsidiary_. Each Legacy Subsidiary which is a
title insurance or escrow company has: (A) paid to its underwriters all
premiums to which each underwriter is entitled; and (B) complied in all
material respects with all requirements set forth in the underwriting
agreements to which such Legacy Subsidiary is a party, including all
underwriting and title examination guidelines. No Legacy Subsidiary which is a
title insurance or escrow company has used escrow or trust funds as collateral
for loans or for other corporate purposes.

 

Section 3.43 _Information Security_. Except as would not reasonably be likely,
either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Legacy, to the Best Knowledge of Legacy, since January 1, 2016, no third party
has gained unauthorized access to any information technology networks
controlled by and material to the operation of the business of Legacy or the
Legacy Subsidiaries.

Section 3.44 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(A) Except for the representations and warranties in this ARTICLE III, neither
Legacy nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Legacy and its Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and Legacy hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing
disclaimer, and except

diligence investigation of Legacy (including any financial projections

transactions contemplated hereby.

(B) Legacy acknowledges and agrees that neither Prosperity nor any other
Person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty
other than those contained in ARTICLE IV.

subsection of the Confidential Schedules delivered herewith ( _provided_ ,

hours to all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records of Legacy and each Legacy Subsidiary, and furnish to Prosperity

it shall desire to make of the affairs of Legacy and each Legacy Subsidiary,
including access sufficient to verify the value of the assets and the
liabilities of Legacy and each Legacy Subsidiary and the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent to Prosperitys obligations described in ARTICLE IX;
_provided, however_ , that Prosperity shall request permission for all such
access reasonably in advance and all such access shall be conducted in a
manner designed to minimize disruption to the normal business operations and
employee or customer relations of Legacy and each Legacy Subsidiary. Legacy

practicable, any additional information that Prosperity may reasonably
request, and shall specifically provide to Prosperity a weekly written report

Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.06 _Untrue Representations_. Legacy shall promptly notify Prosperity
in writing if Legacy becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes
untrue, or shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material

Schedule to this Agreement or any representation or warranty made by Legacy
in ARTICLE III or that results in Legacys failure to comply with any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement.

would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the

Best Knowledge of Legacy, been threatened involving a prospective change) in
the business, financial condition or operations of Legacy and/or any Legacy

contemplated by this Agreement.

contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 5.10  _Transaction Litigation_. Legacy shall give Prosperity prompt
notice of any litigation against Legacy and/or its directors relating to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall
give Prosperity the opportunity to participate, at Prosperitys cost, in the
defense or settlement of any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without the prior written consent of Prosperity, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this
paragraph, "participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect
to the litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common
interest of Legacy and Prosperity in these matters and the applicable
privileges and protections provided therein, and the non-litigating party may
offer comments or suggestions with respect to the litigation and any documents
to be prepared or filed in connection therewith, which will be reasonably
considered in good faith by the litigating party.

maintain the Allowance at a level consistent with Legacy Banks historical
methodology and in compliance with GAAP.

Section 5.12 _No Negotiation with Others_.

advisors, agents and other representatives of Legacy and each Legacy
Subsidiary (collectively, " _Legacy Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate, initiate

(except for the limited purpose of notifying such Person of the existence of

assets or otherwise; (ii) disclose to any third party any information
concerning the business, Properties, books or records of Legacy or any Legacy

of

 



-55- 

    

 any unsolicited offer, Legacy will communicate to Prosperity the terms of
any proposal or request for information and the identity of the parties
involved. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms, Legacy shall not, and it shall cause each Legacy Subsidiary and Legacy
Representative not to, execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, asset or stock purchase or share exchange
agreement, option agreement or other contract related to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance
with Section 5.12(B)).

(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.12,
if at any time after the date hereof and before the receipt of the Requisite
Legacy Stockholder Approval, Legacy and the Legacy Representatives, having
each theretofore complied with the terms of Section 5.12(A), receives a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, Legacy and the Legacy
Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with, and furnish
any information and other access (so long as all such information and access
has previously been made available to Prosperity or is made available to
Prosperity before or concurrently with the time such information or access is
made available to such person) to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal
if, and only if, the Legacy Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, that: (i) such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to become a Superior
Proposal; and (ii) the failure of the Legacy Board to furnish such information
or access or enter into such discussions or negotiations would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; but before
furnishing any such information, Legacy shall have received from the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with
terms at least as restrictive in all material respects on such Person as the
Confidentiality Agreement entered into with Prosperity dated March 25, 2019
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which confidentiality agreement shall
not prohibit Legacy from complying with the terms of this Section 5.12. Legacy
will promptly, and in any event within 24 hours: (a) notify Prosperity in
writing of the receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to Legacy or for access to the Properties, books or
records of Legacy by any Person that has made, or to the Best Knowledge of
Legacy may be considering making, an Acquisition Proposal; and (b)
communicate the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal to Prosperity,
including as they may change upon any modification or amendment to the terms
thereof, and including the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and a copy thereof if in writing and any related documentation or
correspondence. Legacy will keep Prosperity reasonably apprised of the status
of and other matters relating to any such Acquisition Proposal on a timely
basis, including providing a copy of all further related documentation or
correspondence.

(C) Legacy agrees that it: (i) will and will cause the Legacy Subsidiaries and
Legacy Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar
transaction; and (ii) will not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
similar transaction, and will enforce the terms thereof and will promptly
request from such third parties the return or destruction of any confidential
information of Legacy provided thereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent: (a) Legacy or the Legacy Board from: (I) taking the actions
provided in Section 1.08(C) or Section 5.12(B) subject to compliance with the
terms thereof; (II) responding to an

 



-56- 

    

 unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the sole purpose of
clarifying the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal; or (III)
informing any Person who submits an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal of Legacys obligations pursuant to Section 5.12(A); or (b) either
party, in consultation with outside counsel, complying with its disclosure
obligations under federal or state Law including in connection with a Legacy
Change in Recommendation ( _provided_ that any Legacy Change in Recommendation
shall be subject to Section 1.08(C) and shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement).

 

(D) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer, inquiry, indication of interest or proposal from a party other than
Prosperity regarding any of the following (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) involving Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary: (i)
any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization,
business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary or any sale, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions; or (ii) any acquisition by any
party or group of parties (including the shareholders or equity holders
thereof), directly or indirectly, including by any tender offer or exchange

power of Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary.

 

(E) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a party other than
Prosperity to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination or similar
transaction, all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Legacy
or all of the Legacy Shares and that the Legacy Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with its outside legal and financial
advisors: (i) is or would result in a transaction that if consummated would be
more favorable to Legacys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the Merger, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such
proposal and of this Agreement (including any proposal by Prosperity to amend
the terms of this Agreement); and (ii) is capable of being, and is reasonably

in writing by Prosperity, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking Laws
immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries as Legacy may
reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of Legacy to the
accounting policies and practices of Prosperity. No such adjustment by Legacy
or any Legacy Subsidiary shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a
breach, violation or failure by Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement by
Prosperity or be an acknowledgment by Legacy of any adverse circumstances for
purposes of determining whether the conditions to Prosperitys obligations

 



-57- 

    

 under this Agreement have been satisfied. The recording of any such
adjustments in accordance with this Section 5.14 shall not be deemed to imply
any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information
and shall not be construed as concurrence by Legacy, any Legacy Subsidiary or
their respective management with any such adjustments.

Legacy shall purchase an extended reporting period for six years under
Legacys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy for

Legacy as of the date of this Agreement.

banking services, if the Merger occurs, will be terminated after the
consummation of the Merger on a date to be mutually agreed upon by Prosperity
and Legacy. Such notice and actions by Legacy will be in accordance with the

proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in

existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including matters,

indemnification. The Resulting Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
the Resulting Corporation, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation. The obligations of the Resulting Corporation

Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any party entitled to
indemnification hereunder without the prior consent of such affected party.

OTHER AGREEMENTS

 

Section 7.01 _Employee Matters_.

 

(A) To the extent requested by Prosperity in writing delivered to Legacy on or
prior to the earlier of: (i) at least 20 Business Days before the Closing
Date; or (ii) 10 Business Days prior to the commencement of any notice period
required to effectuate the termination of such Employee Plan, Legacy or its
appropriate Subsidiary shall execute and deliver such instruments and
take such other actions as Prosperity may reasonably require in order to
cause the amendment or termination of any Employee Plan on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Prosperity and in accordance with applicable Law and effective
no later than the Closing Date, except that the winding up of any such plan
may be completed following the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, prior to the Closing Date, Legacy will, or will cause the
appropriate Legacy Subsidiary to, terminate the Deferred Compensation Plan
and liquidate all benefits and liabilities under such arrangements. Within 10
Business Days of the date hereof, Legacy shall prepare and deliver to
Prosperity a true and complete list of the notice periods required
to effectuate the termination of each Employee Plan.

(B) To the extent that an employee of Legacy and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") becomes
eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by the
Resulting Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Legacy or its
Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such employee benefit plan to
recognize the service of such Covered Employee with Legacy or its Subsidiaries
for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and benefit accrual under
such employee benefit plan of the Resulting Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than vesting under any stock incentive plan), to the same
extent that such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective
Time under a similar Employee Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, such
recognition of service shall not: operate to duplicate any benefits of
a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service. With respect
to any health care, dental or vision plan of the Resulting Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than Legacy and its Subsidiaries) in which any
Covered Employee is eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate, the Resulting Corporation
shall: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any preexisting
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Resulting
Corporation or Subsidiary plan (excluding any Employee Plan) to be waived with
respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that such limitation would have
been waived or satisfied under the similar Employee Plan in which such
Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law and the applicable Resulting Corporation
or Subsidiary plan; and (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
health care, dental and vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in
the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) to be recognized for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of the Resulting
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any Employee Plan), to the
extent that any such amount was recognized for a similar purpose under the
Employee Plans in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time, to the extent permitted under applicable Law and the
applicable Resulting Corporation or Subsidiary plan.

 



-63- 

    

(C) From and after the date hereof, any written communications to the
employees, officers or directors of Legacy or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be in the
form of mutually agreeable communications, prepared in prior consultation
with Prosperity, it being agreed that Prosperity and Legacy shall cooperate,

such communication, in providing mutually agreeable communications.

of Legacy, Prosperity shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare
all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of: (A) all third parties; and (B) all
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
applications for the prior approval of the Merger and the Bank Merger by the
FDIC, the TDB and the FRB (or appropriate Federal Reserve Bank acting on
delegated authority) (collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ "). If Legacy
has promptly provided information reasonably requested by Prosperity and its
comments to draft applications, and otherwise complied with Section 5.02,
Prosperity shall file all such applications on or before the thirtieth day
following the date of this Agreement, subject to consultation with the FRB on
timing of delivery of a waiver request to the FRB. Prosperity shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Regulatory Approvals and
any other approvals from third parties at the earliest practicable time.
Prosperity and Legacy shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, all the information
relating to Prosperity or Legacy, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted or proposed to be submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. In addition, Prosperity
shall keep Legacy reasonably informed as to the status of such applications
and filings; Prosperity shall promptly furnish Legacy and its counsel with
copies of all such regulatory filings and all correspondence with respect
thereto to the extent permitted by applicable Law; and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, each party shall promptly advise the other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval
is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Prosperity shall not be required to (and
Legacy shall not be permitted to, without Prosperitys prior written consent)
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, involving Prosperity, Legacy or any of their respective
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.02 or otherwise in connection
with obtaining any permits, consents, approvals or authorizations that would
reasonably be expected to be materially burdensome on Prosperity, Legacy, the
Resulting Corporation, Prosperity Bank or Legacy Bank or require a material
modification of, or impose any material limitation or restriction on, the
activities, governance, legal structure, capital structure, compensation or
fee arrangements of Prosperity, Legacy, the Resulting Corporation,
Prosperity 

 



-64- 

    

 Bank or Legacy Bank (any of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ");
_provided, however_ , that the following shall not be deemed to be a
Burdensome Condition: any restraint, limitation, term, requirement, provision
or condition that applies generally to all bank holding companies and banks as
provided by statute, regulation, or written and publicly available supervisory
guidance of general applicability, in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof.

Section 7.03 _Issuance of Prosperity Common Shares_. The Prosperity Shares to
be issued by Prosperity to the stockholders of Legacy pursuant to this
Agreement will, on the issuance and delivery to such stockholders pursuant to
this Agreement, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. The Prosperity Shares to be issued to the stockholders of
Legacy pursuant to this Agreement are and will be free of any preemptive
rights of the shareholders of Prosperity or any other Person, and are not and
will not be restricted securities under the Securities Act, except for
Prosperity Shares issued by Prosperity to any Legacy stockholders who may be
deemed to be an "affiliate" of Prosperity under the Securities Act after
completion of the Merger.

 

Section 7.04 _Appointment of Directors_.

 

(A) Effective immediately after the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Resulting Corporation (the " _Resulting Corporation Board_ ") shall adopt
resolutions and take such other action as necessary to appoint Kevin J.
Hanigan, George A. Fisk and Bruce W. Hunt (the " _Legacy Nominees_ ") to the
Resulting Corporation Board, each for a term expiring at the next annual

Effective Time. The Resulting Corporation shall nominate, and recommend that
the Resulting Corporation shareholders elect, each of the Legacy Nominees to
the Resulting Corporation Board at the first annual meeting of the
shareholders of the Resulting Corporation following the Effective Time.

Nominees compliance with the Resulting Corporations governance and ethics
policies in place from time to time and such Legacy Nominee (other than Kevin
J. Hanigan) qualifying as an independent director under applicable NYSE and
SEC rules, in each case, as reasonably determined by the Resulting
Corporations Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of Legacy subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by officers
or directors of Legacy who may become an officer or director of the Resulting
Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the

each individual whose disposition of Legacy Shares (or Legacy equity awards)
is to be exempted; (ii) the number of Legacy Shares (and Legacy equity

to their Legacy Shares and any Prosperity Shares any such holder receives in
exchange therefor in the Merger.

its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in

available to any party whose action or failure to act has been the cause of or

been obtained); (b) by Prosperity pursuant to Section 10.01(D); or (c) by
Legacy or Prosperity pursuant to Section 10.01(F)(i); and (iii) prior to the
date that is 12 months after the date of such termination, Legacy consummates
a transaction included within the definition of Acquisition Proposal or
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, in
each case, whether or not relating to the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referenced in clause (i), then Legacy shall on the earlier of: (x) the date
such a transaction is consummated or (y) the date any such definitive
agreement is entered into, as applicable, pay Prosperity a fee equal to
$82,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of

-71- 

    

(B) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Prosperity pursuant
to Section 10.01(G), then Legacy shall, within two Business Days after the
date of termination, pay Prosperity the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 

(C) Each of Legacy and Prosperity acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 10.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Prosperity would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Legacy fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 10.04, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Prosperity commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Legacy for the fee set forth herein or any portion thereof, Legacy shall pay
to Prosperity its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Legacy fails to pay
the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.04, then Legacy shall pay
interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date
that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the
date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum
equal to the "prime rate" published in The Wall Street Journal on the date
such payment was required to be made plus 200 basis points for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to
be paid. The amounts payable by Legacy pursuant to this Section 10.04
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy
of Prosperity in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such section. In no event shall Legacy be required to pay the Termination Fee
more than once. Legacys obligation to pay the Termination Fee shall survive
termination of this Agreement.

instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement, and the other
agreements, documents, schedules and instruments executed and delivered by the
parties to each other at the Closing constitute the full understanding of the
parties, a complete allocation of risks between them and a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of their agreement relating to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior agreements, whether
written or oral, that may exist between the parties with respect thereto.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, no conditions,
usage of trade, course of dealing or performance, understanding or agreement
purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of
this Agreement shall be binding unless hereafter or contemporaneously
herewith made in writing and signed by the party to be bound, and no
modification shall be effected by the

 



-72- 

    

 acknowledgment or acceptance of documents containing terms or conditions at
variance with or in addition to those set forth in this Agreement. Each party
to this Agreement acknowledges that, in executing and delivering this
Agreement, it has relied only on the written representations, warranties and
promises of the other parties hereto that are contained herein or in the other
agreements executed by the parties contemporaneously with or, if contemplated
hereby, subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, and has not relied on
the oral statements of any other party or its representatives.

the persons entitled to the benefits of the covenants contained in Section
6.12 are third-party beneficiaries solely with respect to such section. No
party to this Agreement shall assign this Agreement, by operation of law or
otherwise, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other
party. Any assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section
11.13 shall be void and of no effect.

Section 11.14 _Public Disclosure_. None of Prosperity, any Prosperity
Subsidiary, Legacy or any Legacy Subsidiary will make, issue or release, or
cause to be made, issued or released, any announcement, public statement,
press release, or other public disclosure of the existence, terms, conditions
or status of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Prosperity and Legacy, upon prior written
notice to the other party, will be permitted to make, subject to the terms of
this Agreement, any public disclosures or governmental filings as legal
counsel may deem necessary to maintain compliance with or to prevent
violations of applicable federal or state Laws or that may be necessary to
obtain regulatory approval for, or to otherwise effect, the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 11.15 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Closing Date,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards
of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (A) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto;
(B) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained
herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto;
or (C) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure. No party to this Agreement shall by any act (except by a
written instrument given pursuant to this Section 11.15) be deemed to have
waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any breach of
any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder by any party hereto
shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A
waiver of any party of any right or remedy on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would otherwise have
on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other party may have
hereunder.

 

Section 11.16 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by a written
instrument signed by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of
this Agreement by the Legacy stockholders or the Prosperity shareholders; but
after the approval of this Agreement by the Legacy stockholders or
the Prosperity shareholders, there shall not be, without the further approval
of such stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, any amendment of this
Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable Law.
