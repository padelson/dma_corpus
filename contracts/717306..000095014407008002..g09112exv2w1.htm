   ##### 

  

   

 (i) __Cash Oversubscribed__. If the aggregate cash amount that would otherwise be paid upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then: 

   

 (A) all Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, 

   

 (B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to receive the Stock Consideration (" _Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable but does not exceed the Total Cash Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and

 (A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, 

   

 (B) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the Non-Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to receive the Cash Consideration (" _Cash Designated Shares_ ") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable but does not exceed the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and 

   

 (C) the Stock Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares that are not Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   

 (iii) __Cash Subscriptions Sufficient__. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares is equal or nearly equal (as determined by the Exchange Agent) to (but in no event in excess of) the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by First Charter and Fifth Third before the Effective Time.

 (b) As of the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Charter Stock Plans, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any options or other stock-based awards, each participant in any of the First Charter Stock Plans shall fully and immediately vest in any options or other stock-based awards awarded under such First Charter Stock Plans. 

  

 (c) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of First Charter Common Stock granted to employees or directors of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the First Charter Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (collectively, the " _First Charter Options_ ") shall be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such First Charter Option immediately before the Effective Time (taking into account any accelerated vesting of such First Charter Options in accordance with the terms thereof, including terms approved by the First Charter Board before the date of this Agreement as described on _Section 1.6(c)_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule (as defined in _Article III_), the number of whole shares of Fifth Third Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of First Charter Common Stock subject to such First Charter Option immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion Number (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Fifth Third Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of First Charter Common Stock subject to such First Charter Option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Conversion Number.

First Charter and Fifth Third agree that before the Effective Time each of the First Charter Stock Plans shall be amended, to the extent possible without requiring shareholder approval of such amendments, if and to the extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the conversion of First Charter Options granted to any employee or director of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries under a First Charter Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ and the substitution of Fifth Third for First Charter thereunder to the extent appropriate to effectuate the assumption of such First Charter Stock Plans by Fifth Third. From and after the Effective Time, all references to First Charter (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of First Charter) in each First Charter Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of First Charter Options shall be deemed to refer to Fifth Third, unless Fifth Third determines otherwise.

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 

   

 2.1 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of First Charter Common Stock (" _Holder_ ") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this  _Article II_, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures: 

  

 (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 2.1_ (each, an " _Election_ ") (i) the number of shares of First Charter Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of First Charter Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election. 

  

 (b) Before the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall appoint a bank or trust company mutually agreeable to First Charter, or Fifth Thirds transfer agent, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent ( the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder. An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent), in such form as First Charter and Fifth Third shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_ "), shall be mailed no more than 40 business days and no less than 26 business days before the anticipated Effective Time or on such earlier date as First Charter and Fifth Third shall mutually agree (the " _Mailing Date_ ") to each Holder as of five business days before the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ "). Each Election Form shall permit such Holder, subject to the allocation and election procedures set forth in this _Section 2.1_, to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration for all of the shares of First Charter Common Stock held by such Holder in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_, (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for all of such shares in accordance with _Section 1.4(c)_, (iii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration for a part of such Holders First Charter Common Stock and the Cash Consideration for the remaining part of such Holders First Charter Common Stock or (iv) indicate that such Holder has no preference as to the receipt of cash or Fifth Third Common Stock for such shares (a " _Non-Election_ "). A Holder who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative capacity (a " _Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election Forms, _provided_ that each such Election Form covers all the shares of First Charter Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Any shares of First Charter Common Stock with respect to which the Holder thereof has not, as of the Election Deadline, made an election by submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares. 

  

 (c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form shall be submitted to the Exchange Agent on or before 5:00 p.m., Charlotte, North Carolina time, on the day indicated on the Election Form (or such other time and date as Fifth Third and First Charter may mutually agree) (the " _Election Deadline_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Election Deadline may not occur before the 25th day following the Mailing Date or after the business day prior to Closing Date. Fifth Third shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible an Election Form to any Holder who requests such Election Form following the initial mailing of the Election Forms and before the Election Deadline. First Charter shall provide to the Exchange 

   ##### 

  

 

Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified
herein. An Election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of
First Charter Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included with the Election Form. If a Holder
either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form in a timely
fashion or (ii) revokes its Election Form before the Election Deadline
(without later submitting a properly completed Election Form before the
Election Deadline), the shares of First Charter Common Stock held by such
Holder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Holder may revoke or
change his or her Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if
such notice of revocation or change is actually received by the Exchange
Agent at or before the Election Deadline. Fifth Third shall cause the
Certificate or Certificates relating to any revoked Election Form to be
promptly returned without charge to the person submitting the Election Form
to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have discretion to determine when any
Election, modification or revocation is received and whether any
such Election, modification or revocation has been properly made. 

   

 2.2 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or before the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (a) certificates representing the number of shares of Fifth Third Common Stock sufficient to deliver, and Fifth Third shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and (b) immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ ) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and Fifth Third shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 2.3 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) that immediately before the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of First Charter Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.4_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 2.3(f)_ upon surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.4(c)_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of First Charter Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate Cash Consideration paid to each such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of First Charter Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this _Article II_. 

  

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Fifth Third Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Fifth Third Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Fifth Third Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Fifth Third Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing First Charter Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of First Charter, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Fifth Third Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such First Charter Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Fifth Third that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Fifth Third) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of First Charter Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Fifth Third, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Fifth Third, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder of shares of First Charter Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Fifth Third, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of First Charter of the shares of First Charter Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of First Charter Common Stock that occurred before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this  _Article II_. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Fifth Third Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Fifth Third. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Fifth Third shall pay to each former shareholder of First Charter who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Per Share Amount by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of First Charter Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Fifth Third Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.4_. 

  

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of First Charter as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Fifth Third. In such event, any former shareholders of First Charter who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Fifth Third with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Fifth Third Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of First Charter Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Fifth Third, First Charter, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of First Charter Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (h) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Fifth Third or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Fifth Third may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 6.5 _The Nasdaq Global Select Market Listing_. Fifth Third shall cause the shares of Fifth Third Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, before the Effective Time. 

  

 6.6 _Employee Matters_. 

  

 (a) For the six-month period following the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, provide to those individuals actively employed by, or on an authorized leave of absence from, First Charter or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") with employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage and employee benefits and annual bonus opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the First Charter Benefit Plans as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular First Charter Benefit Plan, (ii) give any third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.6_, (iii) limit the right of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at any time or require Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such Covered Employee benefits, rates of base salary or hourly wage or annual bonus opportunities for any period following any such termination, other than as required by applicable law or pro-rata incentive plan payouts, or (iv) obligate First Charter, Fifth Third or any of their respective Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular First Charter Benefit Plan or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee. 

  

 Fifth Third will offer or provide to any Covered Employee retained by Fifth Third or any affiliate of Fifth Third participation in employee benefit plans and arrangements available for similarly situated employees of Fifth Third or its affiliates or Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covered Employee shall be eligible to participate in Fifth Thirds Master 

   ##### 

  

 

Retirement Plan, which has been frozen as to new participants. In addition,
Fifth Third shall not be obligated to cause any Covered Employee to
participate in any defined benefit plan that is maintained by Fifth Third, or
any affiliate of Fifth Third, whether or not such plan meets the requirements
of Code Section 414(j). 

   

 (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries, other than First Charter or its Subsidiaries, Fifth Third shall cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered Employee with First Charter or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent such service was recognized immediately before the Effective Time under a comparable First Charter Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was a participant immediately before the Effective Time or, if there is no such comparable benefit plan, to the same extent such service was recognized under the First Charter Retirement Savings Plan immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee; and (ii) with respect to any health, dental or vision plan of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries (other than First Charter and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year that includes the year in which such Covered Employee is eligible to participate, (x) cause any pre-existing condition limitations under such Fifth Third or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the First Charter Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (c) If a Covered Employee (other than temporary and/or co-operative employees) who does not have an employment, change-in-control or severance agreement with First Charter (i) is terminated by Fifth Third or any of its Subsidiaries due to a permanent or indefinite reduction in staff resulting in job elimination, reduction of a position as the result of an organizational or business restructuring, discontinuance of an operation, relocation of all or a part of Fifth Thirds or its Subsidiaries business, sale of an operation to another company, or sale or other change in ownership of all or a part of Fifth Thirds or its Subsidiaries business, or (ii) voluntarily resigns after being notified that, as a condition of employment, such Covered Employee must work at a location more than thirty (30) miles from his or her former location of employment or that such Covered Employees base salary will be materially decreased, in any case and in both cases, during the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending six months following the Effective Time, such Covered Employee shall be entitled to receive severance payments and benefits in an amount and form as generally described in Fifth Thirds severance policy in effect immediately before the date hereof (including customary releases); _provided_ , that the maximum severance pay amounts described in such severance policy shall not apply and shall, instead, be limited to a maximum 52 week severance pay amount, regardless of employee classification; and _provided_ _further_ , that such Covered Employee shall also be entitled to receive payment of COBRA premium costs for the continuation of group medical insurance benefit coverage for the Covered Employee and his or her eligible dependents for a period equal to the 

   ##### 

  

 

total number of weeks of base salary/wages available to such Covered Employee
as severance pay. 

   

 First Charter shall take whatever action necessary to terminate any and all other severance arrangements and to ensure it and Fifth Third have no other liability for any other severance payments (other than as set forth in this _Section 6.6(c)_, and agreements disclosed in  _Section 3.11(i)_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule). First Charter shall cooperate with Fifth Third to effectuate the foregoing, including Fifth Thirds compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act or any similar state or local law. 

  

 Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall be construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way Fifth Thirds at-will employment policy. In addition, in no event shall severance pay payable under this _Section 6.6(c)_ to any Covered Employee who does not have an employment, change-in-control or severance agreement with First Charter be taken into account in determining the amount of any other benefit (including, but not limited to, an individuals benefit under any retirement plan, SERP or agreement). If, by reason of the controlling plan document, controlling law or otherwise, severance pay is taken into account in determining any other benefit, the severance pay otherwise payable shall be reduced by the present value of the additional benefit determined under other benefit plans attributable to the severance pay. 

  

 (d) From and after the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof with the prior written consent of Fifth Third, each employment agreement, retention agreement and change-in-control agreement listed on _Section 3.11(i)_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule (unless otherwise agreed by Fifth Third and the applicable counterparty to such agreement) and the obligations of First Charter and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement listed on _Section 3.11(i)_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule. Fifth Third agrees to take all action necessary to effectuate and satisfy the obligations set forth in the agreements listed in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule. First Charter has no contractual responsibility (and has made no promise or commitment to be responsible) for any Tax, penalty or interest imposed on any person by reason of any such agreements (or payments thereunder) that fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 409A. 

  

 (e) Before the Effective Time, Fifth Third shall use its reasonable best efforts to offer to certain First Charter employees (the number and identification of which shall be made in the absolute and sole discretion of Fifth Third in coordination with the President of First Charter) retention agreements to assist in the voluntary retention of First Charter employees following the Effective Time. However, notwithstanding any possible inferences to the contrary, neither First Charter, Fifth Third nor their respective Subsidiaries intend for this _Section 6.6(e)_ to create any rights or obligations except as between First Charter, its Subsidiaries and Fifth Third and its Subsidiaries, and no past, present or future employees of First Charter or its Subsidiaries shall be treated as third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6(e)_. 

  

 (f) If Fifth Third so requests (which request shall be made no less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time), First Charter shall take any and all actions required (including without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by its Board of Directors) to amend, freeze and/or 

   ##### 

  

 

terminate any or all First Charter Benefits Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and, if requested by Fifth Third, to implement any such
actions. 

   

 First Charter shall provide to Fifth Third at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time, documentation that shows that the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4), 404, 410(b), 412, 415, 416 and 401(k)(3) and (m)(2) are met by or with respect to each First Charter Benefit Plan subject to such requirements as to the plans latest three (3) plan years which have ended prior to the date of this Agreement. 

  

 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 6.7_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time or taken at the request of Fifth Third pursuant to _Section 6.8_, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of First Charter or any Subsidiary of First Charter, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Fifth Third pursuant to _Section 6.8_. 

  

 (c) Fifth Third shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time to be covered for a 

   ##### 

  

 

period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers
liability insurance policy maintained by First Charter ( _provided_ that
Fifth Third may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous
than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring before
the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in
their capacity as such;  _provided_ that in no event shall Fifth Third be
required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of
the annual premiums currently paid by First Charter (which current amount is
set forth on _Section 6.7_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule) for
such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ _further_ that if
Fifth Third is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as
a result of the preceding proviso, Fifth Third shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount. 

   

 (d) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. 

  

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Fifth Third, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of First Charter, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Fifth Thirds sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Fifth Third. 

  

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Fifth Third and First Charter shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (a) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; _provided_ _further_  that a failure to comply with this _Section 6.9_ shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied. 

  

 6.10 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) None of First Charter, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any 

   ##### 

  

 

discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction, (iii) enter
into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction or (iv) render the
Rights Agreement inapplicable to an Alternative Proposal or the transactions
contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the First Charter Board
and its representatives shall be permitted, before the approval of
this Agreement by First Charters shareholders, and subject to compliance
with the other terms of this  _Section 6.10_ and to first entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal
on terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to First Charter
than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, to furnish
nonpublic information regarding First Charter to a person, and to consider
and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide
Alternative Proposal received by First Charter and, in connection with such
Alternative Proposal, to render inapplicable to such person the
Rights Agreement, if and only to the extent that and so long as the First
Charter Board reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would cause it to violate its
fiduciary duties. 

   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (w) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Fifth Third or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of First Charter Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from First Charter or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (x) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving First Charter (other than the Merger), (y) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Fifth Third or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of First Charter and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of First Charters Subsidiaries) of First Charter, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of First Charter and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately before such transaction, or (z) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of First Charter immediately before such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of First Charter Common Stock immediately before the consummation thereof. 

  

 (b) First Charter shall notify Fifth Third promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to First Charter or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of First Charter or any Subsidiary by any person that informs the First Charter Board or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Fifth Third shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting nonpublic information or access to the books and records of First Charter or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or 

   ##### 

  

 

amendment to an Alternative Proposal. First Charter shall keep Fifth Third
fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and
any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative
Proposal, indication or request. First Charter shall also promptly, and in
any event within 24 hours, notify Fifth Third, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal
in accordance with _Section 6.10(a)_. 

   

 (c) First Charter and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Fifth Third) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all persons other than Fifth Third who have been furnished confidential information regarding First Charter in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months before the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. First Charter agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which First Charter or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal. 

  

 (d) First Charter shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of First Charter or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this _Section 6.10_ as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.10_ by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of First Charter or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of First Charter or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.10_ by First Charter. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.10_ shall prohibit First Charter or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 6.11 _Advisory Board; Noncompetes_. Fifth Third shall, upon consultation with each Member of the First Charter Board, offer each such director either (a) a seat on a Fifth Third local advisory board for the region formerly served by First Charter for a one-year period after the Effective Date or (b) a one-year advisory and consulting contract. In either case, for a period of one year after the Effective Date, Fifth Third shall pay quarterly compensation to such directors consistent with the existing fee structure offered by First Charter to such directors as set forth on _Section 6.11_ of the First Charter Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 6.12 _Restructuring Efforts_. If First Charter shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its shareholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its shareholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation 

   ##### 

  

 

to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner
adverse to such party or its shareholders) and to resubmit the transaction to
First Charters shareholders for approval, with the timing of such
resubmission to be determined at the request of Fifth Third. 

   

 6.13 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of First Charter and Fifth Third agrees to exercise good faith and use its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as possible. 

  

 6.14 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Fifth Third and First Charter shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Fifth Third Common Stock and First Charter Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of First Charter Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of First Charter Common Stock and any shares of Fifth Third Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Fifth Third Bancorp 
  
 ____________________________ 
 

   


 ____________________________ 

   

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

   

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of First Charter Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (" _First Charter_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 15, 2007 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between Fifth Third Bancorp, an Ohio corporation (" _Fifth Third_ "), and First Charter, First Charter shall be merged with and into Fifth Third (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 I represent, warrant and covenant to Fifth Third that if I receive any Fifth Third Common Stock as a result of the Merger: 

  

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Fifth Third Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations. 

  

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Fifth Third Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for First Charter. 

  

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of Fifth Third Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the shareholders of First Charter I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of First Charter and the distribution by me of Fifth Third Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Fifth Third Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Fifth Third, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) I understand that Fifth Third is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Fifth Third Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available. 

  

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Fifth Thirds transfer agents with respect to Fifth Third Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Fifth Third Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

  

       |   | "The securities represented by this certificate have been
issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration
statement under that act or an exemption from such registration."  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Fifth Third Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Fifth Third reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee: 

  

       |   | "The shares represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person
who received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the
holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be
sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Fifth Thirds transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Time and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Fifth Third (1) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Fifth Third, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (2) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act. 

  

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, 

   ##### 

  

 

executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other
organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of
any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. 

   

 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of First Charter as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

  | MASTER DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT  
  

  

This Master Data Processing Agreement is made between FIFTH THIRD PROCESSING
SOLUTIONS, a division of FIFTH THIRD BANK, an Ohio banking corporation,
having its principal office at 38 Fountain Square Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio
45263 (collectively "Vendor") and  _ _, having its
principal office at _ _ ("Customer"). Vendor and Customer
hereby agree as follows; 

   

 _1\. DEFINITIONS_  

  

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
meanings set forth below: (a) "Agreement" shall mean this Master Data
Processing Agreement and each addendum attached hereto or referencing this
Agreement, and all documents and other materials incorporated herein
by reference; (b) "Addendum" or "Addenda" shall mean the addenda incorporated
herein or referencing this Agreement, which describe some of the terms under
which the data processing services will be provided by Vendor to Customer,
and the fees to be charged therefore; (c) "Services" shall mean the data
processing services provided by Vendor to Customer as described in the
Addenda; (d) other defined terms applicable to this Agreement and each
Addendum will be contained in a "Definitions and General Services Addendum"
as may be published as of the date hereof and modified from time to time by
Vendor (provided that in the event of an inconsistency between the substantive
terms, including pricing, contained in the Definitions and General Services
Addendum and the substantive terms, including pricing, contained in the
Master Data Processing Agreement or any Addenda, the substantive terms,
including pricing, contained in this Agreement or the Addenda, as
applicable, shall control), and the parties agree that such Addenda shall be
incorporated herein and made part of this Agreement. This Master Data
Processing Agreement contains the general terms and conditions applicable to
each Addendum. Each Addendum describes the specific Services to be provided by
Vendor to Customer and supplements the Master Data Processing Agreement. 

   

 _2\. SERVICES_  

  

Vendors Obligations. Vendor will perform the Services as set forth in the
Addenda. Vendor may make changes in the Services based upon, but not limited
to, technological developments, legislative or regulatory changes, or the
introduction of new services by Vendor. Vendor will use its reasonable best
efforts to notify Customer of any such changes that will materially
affect Customer at least 30 days prior to the implementation date of any such
change. The parties agree that Vendor shall be the exclusive provider of the
Services described in each Addendum to this Agreement. 

   

 _3\. TERM_  

  

The term of this Agreement shall commence _ _, and shall
continue thereafter in accordance with the respective Addenda, unless earlier
terminated in accordance with this Agreement or any Addendum. Notwithstanding
any Addendum, Vendor may, at any time prior to a renewal period, refuse to
extend the term of any Addendum if Customer is in default of this Agreement,
or has from time to time been in default of this Agreement. 

   

 _4\. FEES AND PAYMENTS_  

  

The Customer shall pay to Vendor for the Services, the fees and expenses set
forth in this Agreement and the Addenda, which shall be described on
a Vendors Services Invoice. Vendor will debit Customers billing account on
or any time after the first day of each month through ACH. Customer shall
supply Vendor with a demand deposit account (DDA) for such billing
payment. Customer, may, in good faith, reasonably dispute the validity of
Vendors fees, provided Customer gives Vendor written notification of such
dispute within ten 10 days of the date the Services Invoice is made available
to Customer, and such notice references the specific disputed Vendor fees and
the basis for such dispute. Notwithstanding, all fees shall be paid within 30
days of the date of Customers Services Invoice unless otherwise provided
herein. Vendor may not increase the fees during the first 12 months of the
Initial Term of any Addendum. Thereafter, Vendor may change, at its
discretion, any fee upon notice to Customer; provided, however, that any
increase in prices for existing recurring Services shall not in the aggregate
exceed 10% in any calendar year, excluding any price increase due to
increased fees or assessments imposed by third party providers such as, but
not limited to, telecommunication companies and national or regional network
switch providers ("Third Party Increases"). Any increase, except Third Party
increases, shall become effective not less than 30 days after the date Vendor
sends to Customer, by ordinary mail, notice of such increase. Vendor may
charge for any non-specified service it provides and expense it incurs at
the request of or on behalf of Customer and Customer shall pay for such
services and expenses as provided in this Section 4. 

  

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 4, in the event that by
virtue of any law, rule, or regulation now existing or hereinafter enacted,
Vendor or Customer becomes obligated to change in any fashion their manner of
doing business in order to comply with such law, rule or regulation and
Vendor incurs any increased cost by virtue thereof. Vendor may reasonably
increase its fees to Customer as necessary to offset such increased costs.
Any increased fees hereunder, shall not be taken into account for purposes of
any price adjustment. 

  

All fees and charges paid hereunder shall be made without set-off or
deduction. Any fee not paid when due shall bear interest at 1 percentage
point per month but in no event more than the highest interest rate permitted
by Law. 

   

 _5\. TITLE TO THE SERVICES_  

  

Customer agrees it is acquiring only a limited, nontransferable, nonexclusive
right to use the Services. Vendor shall at all times retain exclusive title
to the Services, including without limitation, any materials delivered to
Customer hereunder and any invention, development, product, content, trade
name, trademark, service mark, software program, or derivative thereof,
developed in connection with providing the Services or during the term of
this Agreement. 

   

 _6\. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION_  

  

(a) Confidential Information Supplied by Vendor. Customer acknowledges that
the methods, techniques, programs, devices and operations of Vendor are of a
confidential nature, and are valuable and unique assets of Vendors business.
During the term of this Agreement and following the expiration or termination
thereof, Customer shall not disclose any such confidential information to any
person or entity, other than to those employees and agents of Customer
who participate in the performance of this Agreement and need access to such
information, and/or governmental agencies that regulate and examine Customer.
Upon the later of the expiration/termination of this Agreement and the date
Customer is no longer required to maintain such confidential information for
governmental/regulatory compliance, Customer shall either deliver to Vendor
all confidential information of Vendor, and all copies thereof, relating in
any way to the Services or to Vendor, whether delivered in physical paper
version or electronically to Customer or, alternatively, certify in writing
to Vendor that all such confidential information has been properly destroyed
by Customer. Customer acknowledges that it does not have nor can
Customer acquire any right in or claim to such confidential information.
Customer shall take all necessary steps, to cause its employees, agents, and
third party auditors, to comply with the terms of this Section 6(a). Customer
acknowledges that the injury that would be sustained by Vendor as a result of
the violation of this provision cannot be compensated solely by money damages,
and therefore agrees that Vendor shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief
and any other remedies as may be available at law or in equity in the event
Customer or its employees or agents violate the provisions contained in this
Section 6(a). The restrictions contained in this Section 6(a) shall not apply
to any information which becomes a matter of public knowledge, other than
through a violation of this Agreement or other agreements to which Vendor is
a party. 

  

Vendor will make available a copy of Vendors designated, most recently
published audit and review report performed by Vendors independent, third
party auditors, (hereinafter "Audit Report"). Customer further acknowledges
that any information disclosed to Customer during the term of this Agreement,
in any way related to the Audit Reports, including but not limited to the
specific contents and general results of such Audit Reports, shall be treated
as confidential and proprietary in accordance with the foregoing paragraph,
and shall be disclosed only to those employees who have a specific need to
know, and, as required, those governmental/regulatory agencies that regulate
and examine Customer. Upon the later of the expiration/termination of this

Agreement and the date Customer is no longer required to maintain such
confidential information for governmental/regulatory compliance, Customer
shall either return all copies, memoranda, materials, other papers and copies
relating to the Audit Reports, including physical and electronic copies of
the Audit Reports, with electronic copies permanently removed from
all Customer computer systems or, alternatively, certify in writing to Vendor
that all such information has been properly destroyed by Customer. 

  

(b) Confidential Information Furnished by Customer. Vendor recognizes that in
order to enable Vendor to provide the Services, Customer may disclose to
Vendor certain confidential information concerning its business, accounts and
customers. Vendor will not disclose any such confidential information other
than to those employees and agents who participate in the performance of
this Agreement. Not limiting the generality of the foregoing or any
obligation of Customer in this Agreement, Vendor for its part, and as may be
required of Vendor by the Gramm, Leach, Bliley Act ("the GLB Act") or by any
applicable guidelines issued pursuant to such Act, will not
disclose Nonpublic Personal information, as such is defined by the GLB
Act, received from Customer in connection with providing the Services
("NPI"), to unrelated and unauthorized third parties, other than in the
course of providing the Services or in the performance of the Agreement.
Provided, however, Vendor may disclose information it receives as may be
required or permitted by any federal, state or local ordinance, any
regulation or directive of any governmental agency, or any court order or
legal process. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Customer acknowledges and agrees that Vendor and/or any of its affiliates may
make public the execution of this Agreement by Customer and/or any of
Customers affiliates; and/or the Services which may be or have been provided
under the Agreement Vendor agrees that it maintains an information
security program designed to (1) protect the security and confidentiality of
NPI, (2) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
integrity of such NPI; (3) protect against unauthorized access to or use of
such NPI that could result in substantial harm to the customers of Customer;
and (4) provide for the proper disposal of NPI. Additionally, Vendor agrees
that should there be any unauthorized disclosure of the NPI of a customer of
Customer, while under the direct control of Vendor, that Vendor shall notify
the Customer of such unauthorized disclosure, promptly upon its discovery,
take commercially reasonable and appropriate steps which are within
Vendors control to prevent further unauthorized disclosure, and
reasonably assist in identifying the range of Customers customers who may
have been impacted by such unauthorized disclosure. Customer acknowledges and
agrees that Vendors obligations set forth in Section 6(b) shall not
relieve Customer of any obligations it may have under this Agreement, or
any law, rule or regulation, including Network Documentation. 

  

(c) Miscellaneous. Customer acknowledges that Vendor shall not be responsible
for the accuracy or adequacy of any information provided by Customer or
others to Vendor; nor shall Vendor be liable for any damage, loss or
liability whatsoever resulting to Customer or its customers as a result
of the inaccuracy or inadequacy of such information. 

   

 _7. TERMINATION BY CUSTOMER_  

  

(a) Correcting Defects. In the event that any materials furnished by Vendor
are inaccurate, incomplete, or incorrect, or in the event Vendor temporarily
fails to provide the Services (collectively a "Defect"), Vendor may either
correct the Defect, without charge to Customer, or effect an equitable
reduction of the price paid or payable for the Services to which such Defect
relates, provided that Vendor has received written notice of the Defect from
Customer within 30 days from the date on which Customer became aware of, or
should have become aware of, such Defect; provided, however. Vendor will not
be liable to Customer for any Defect that should have been reported to Vendor
pursuant to Section 10(d), or which Defect first occurred, whether or not
discovered by Customer, more than 30 days prior to Vendors receipt of notice
of the Defect. 

  

(b) Substantial Nonperformance. In the event Customer reasonably believes
that Vendor has substantially failed to provide the Services, Customer will
give to Vendor a written notice specifically describing the nature of such
failure and the approximate date on which Vendor failed to so provide the
Services. Upon receipt of such notice, Vendor shall have 30 days to cure such
failure or such longer time as mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the
event Vendor fails to cure such failure within such time, and such failure
has or will have a materially adverse effect upon Customer, Customer shall
have a right to terminate this Agreement effective upon not less than 60 days
prior notice to Vendor. 

  

Upon such termination, Vendor will reimburse Customer the actual monetary
damages Customer incurred as a result of Vendors nonperformance; provided,
however, in no event shall such damages exceed the limit of liability set
forth in Section 9\. The obligations of Vendor under this Section 7 are
conditioned upon: (i) Vendors receipt of a notice of nonperformance from
Customer as required in this Section 7; and, (ii) Vendors nonperformance is
not the result of any negligent, improper or prohibited act or omission of
Customer, or their employees or agents, or any other factor not directly
within the reasonable control of Vendor. Customer shall promptly
reimburse Vendor for any expenses incurred by Vendor in investigating or
correcting any problem experienced by Customer, which is the responsibility
of or caused by Customer. Customer shall promptly reimburse Vendor for 50% of
all expenses incurred by Vendor in investigating or correcting any problems
experienced by Customer which is not the responsibility of or solely caused
by Vendor under this Agreement. 

  

(c) Excused or Delayed Performance. Vendor shall not be deemed to be in
default under this Agreement nor liable for any delay or toss in the
performance, failure to perform, or interruption of any Services resulting,
directly or indirectly, from errors in data provided by Customer or others,
labor disputes, fire or other casualty, criminal activity, governmental orders
or regulations, or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing, beyond Vendors reasonable control. Upon such an occurrence,
performance by Vendor shall be excused until the cause for the delay has been
removed and Vendor has had a reasonable time to again provide the Services.
Without limiting any of the foregoing, Vendor acknowledges that it has
implemented and will maintain a Business Continuity Plan, an executive
summary of which Customer acknowledges prior receipt hereof. Customer
acknowledges that any Business Continuity Plan implemented or maintained by
Vendor shall not serve as a guarantee or insurance of any kind against or
with respect to an event as described in the foregoing or otherwise. 

   

 _8\. TERMINATION BY VENDOR_  

  

(a) Default by Customer. Customer shall be in default under this Agreement
upon the occurrence of any of the following events ("Events of Default"), and
upon such occurrence, Vendor may at any time thereafter, terminate this
Agreement effective upon 60 days prior notice to Customer. 

   

 (i) In the event Customer becomes subject to any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, a reorganization or liquidation proceeding, a receiver is appointed for Customer, or Customer makes an assignment for benefit of creditors, or admits its inability to pay its debts as they come due; or, 

  

 (ii) In the event Customer fails to pay fees, expenses or charges, subject to Customers dispute rights in Section 4, when they become due; or, 

  

 (iii) In the event 50% or more of Customers assets related to the Services are sold, divested, transferred or otherwise disposed of while this Agreement is in full force and effect; or, 

  

 (iv) In the event Customer is in default of any terms or conditions of this Agreement (other than Section 4 or any Addendum whether by reason of its own action or inaction or that of another, and such default continues for 30 days after receipt of notice from Vendor describing such default or violation, unless within such 30-day period Customer either corrects the default or, in the reasonable opinion of Vendor, initiates appropriate action to correct such default and thereafter diligently pursues to cure such default. 

 

(b) Termination. Termination of this Agreement for any reason shall
not relieve Customer from any liability or obligation to Vendor arising prior
to such termination. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Customer shall be liable to Vendor for liquidated damages in an amount equal
to the average amount of the monthly revenue payable to Vendor (excluding
any credits applied to and/or fees waived for Customer by Vendor) as a result
of this Agreement for the 3 calendar months in which Customers billings were
the highest during the preceding 12 calendar months (or such shorter period
if this Agreement has not been in effect for 12 months), multiplied by the
number of months remaining during the then current term of this Agreement.
Customer and Vendor recognize and agree that the liquidated damages are fair
and reasonable because it is not possible to establish the actual increase in
volume and activity by Customer during the term of this Agreement. Customer
shall also reimburse Vendor for any damage, loss or expense incurred by
Vendor as a result of a breach by Customer, including any damages set forth
in any Addendum. All such amounts shall be due and payable by Customer on
the effective date of termination. In addition to, and not in limitation
of the foregoing, Vendor may refuse to provide the Services in the event
it has not been paid for the Services as provided in Section 4. 

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in the event that
Customer fails to comply in any material respect with any applicable laws,
Network Documentation as defined in any Addendum, or any other Network Rules,
Regulations, Policies or Procedures, which failure has or may adversely
affect Vendor, Vendor reserves the right to refuse to 

   

Master Data Processing Agreement Page 2 of 4 

    ##### 

  

 

perform the Services for Customer unless and until Customer has corrected its
failure to comply. Additionally, Vendor may, at its sole option, suspend that
portion of the Services to which, based upon Vendors reasonable
determination, there has been an occurrence or potential occurrence
of illegal or wrongful activity, fraudulent use or attempted fraudulent
activity by Customer or any significant wrongful activity, fraudulent use or
attempted fraudulent activity by cardholder(s) of Customer or any other third
party, and Customer has not, in Vendors reasonable determination taken
sufficient steps to prevent further wrongful activity, fraudulent use or
attempted fraudulent activity associated with such portion of the affected
Services. 

   

 _9\. LIMITS ON LIABILITY_  

  

EXCEPT THOSE EXPRESS WARRANTIES MADE IN THIS AGREEMENT, VENDOR DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Without limiting the
foregoing, Vendor shall not be liable for lost profits, lost business or any
incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages (whether or not
arising out of circumstances known or foreseeable by Vendor) suffered by
Customer, its customers or any third party in connection with the Services
provided by Vendor hereunder. Vendors liability hereunder shall in no event
exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) actual monetary damages incurred
by Customer or (ii) fees paid for the Services for the calendar month
immediately preceding the date on which Vendor received Customers notice of
nonperformance as set forth in Section 7. In no event shall Vendor be liable
for any matter beyond its reasonable control, or for damages or losses wholly
or partially caused by the Customer, or its employees or agents, or for any
damages or losses which could have been avoided or limited by Customer giving
notice to Vendor as provided in Section 7\. No cause of action, regardless
of form, shall be brought by either party more than 1 year after the cause
of action arose, other than one for the nonpayment of fees and other amounts,
including any damages, due Vendor under this Agreement. 

   

 _10\. CUSTOMER S REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS_

Vendor. 

  

(d) That it will review all reports made available to Customer. Customers
failure to reject any settlement oriented report within 3 business days of
its receipt or any other report within 10 business days of its receipt shall
constitute acceptance of the report. 

  

(e) That it shall comply with all time deadlines, equipment and
software maintenance and upgrading requirements which Vendor may
reasonably impose on Customer from time to time. 

  

(f) That it shall solely be responsible for all record-keeping as may

at Vendors then standard fees.

officers, employees, affiliates and agents, harmless from all proceedings,
claims, liabilities and expenses whatsoever (including reasonable legal and

the Network Documentation (as defined in any Addendum), or by reason of any
breach or nonperformance of any provision of this Agreement or any Addendum
on the part of the Customer, or its employees, agents or customers,
except, however, to the extent such is due to the breach of this Agreement by
Vendor. 

  

(h) That it will not solicit or hire Vendors employees for employment during
the period that this Agreement is in force and effect and for 1 year after
the termination or expiration of this Agreement. However, Customer shall not
be in violation of the foregoing, and Customer shall have the right, to
solicit and/or hire an employee of Vendor in circumstances where Vendors

directly contacts Customer or one of its affiliates or subsidiaries or a
recruiter, employment agency or similar entity refers Vendors employee to

Agreement.

all the terms of this Agreement and any Addendum, including any amendments

 _12\. AUDIT PROCEDURES_  

  

Upon Customers request and at Customers expense. Customer or its agent, may
review the files held relating to the Service Invoices one (1) time per year.
Such review shall occur during normal business hours at a mutually agreeable
time. Vendor will assist in such review as requested; provided, however, that
Vendor reserves the right to charge Customer for Vendors reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses and its standard fees for the time spent by Vendors personnel
in providing such review assistance. 

  

Additionally, in the event the governmental body or regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over Customer, seeks to audit Vendor or Vendors
facilities ("Audit"), Vendor will reasonably cooperate with such Audit.
Provided, however, that Vendor reserves the right to charge Customer for
Vendors out-of-pocket expenses and its standard fees for the time spent by
Vendors personnel in assisting or providing information in response to any
request from such governmental/regulatory auditors.

forth in Section 4 hereof.

manner as it deems advisable in its reasonable discretion. Customer assumes
all responsibility for collecting any amounts arising in connection with the

of any changes or modifications to the Network Documentation which affect the
responsibilities of a Network Participant or any processor in such Network,
Vendor may amend this Agreement and/or change the applicable Service upon 30
days prior written notice to Customer. 

  

Customer elects to be a participating member in Vendors proprietary Jeanie
Network for the term of this Agreement and in accordance with the Jeanie

discretion, (as the case may be) may acknowledge Customers participation
agreement in a separate agreement which shall be effective upon delivery to
such Customer. 

   

 _E. THIRD PARTY FEES_  

  

Customer shall pay all third party fees, costs, expenses and assessments in
connection with the Services, which may change from time to time, whether
incurred directly or indirectly by Customer, Vendor and/or its affiliates.

expenses (e.g. equipment, lines, drop charges, access charges, long
distance, etc.); all hardware costs (e.g. the cost of individual
Terminals, modems, upgrades, modem sharing devices, etc. and any expenses
associated therewith (e.g. setups, maintenance, etc.)); all Network fees per
Section D. above; all miscellaneous fees associated with the Services (e.g.
mailing expenses, overnight courier expenses, plastics, etc.); and all costs
associated with maintaining and implementing all software and hardware
necessary for any interface affecting the Services. Customer acknowledges and
agrees that Customer shall continue to be responsible for all fees, costs and
expenses associated with telecommunications for so long as third party

expenses by such third party. 

   

 _F. GENERAL PROVISIONS_  

  

1\. Customer hereby agrees to take all steps as may reasonably be necessary
to settle with Vendor for all fees, amounts and Transactions involving its

core processor, card production agents, or other services providers,
hereinafter ("Customer Agents") to facilitate the exchange of data between
such Customer Agents, Customer and/or Vendor, or as otherwise necessary
to facilitate Customers receipt of the Services. Customer, in connection
with receipt of the Services, hereby authorizes Vendor to send data,

and releases Vendor from any liability related to the release of any
such information. 

  

6. Customer agrees to be responsible for all direct and indirect
costs (including but not limited to those incurred by Vendor). Vendors
standard fees for conversion, reasonable out of pocket expenses (including
but not limited to travel, meals, telephone, etc.), and time and materials,
based upon Vendors standard rates, for any personnel, as applicable
in connection with and/or related to any conversion by Customer or
in connection with any other processor or vendor conversion after
Customers initial conversion to Vendor. 

  

7\. Upon the expiration or termination of this addendum for any reason,
Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall be assessed Vendors standard
fees for Vendors Basic Deconversion Services, and such Variable or
Incidental Deconversion Fees as applicable prior to the provision of
any Deconversion related Services. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it
shall be responsible for requiring its successor service provider to
coordinate all aspects of Customers conversion to such new service provider
and for requiring such new service provider to accept transfer of any and/or
all of Customers debit/check card bank identification number(s) ("BINs")
maintained on Vendors system. Customer further agrees to accept
full responsibility for all applicable fees, trailing activity (e.g.:
Cardholder chargebacks, adjustment items, Transactions by Cardholders etc.),
or third party costs or fees arising out of the Services, including but in no
way limited to telecommunications fees, Network fees, fines or penalties, and
any fees imposed by any Network, arising out of Customers debit/check cards
and any BINs on Vendors system until such time as all BINs are completely
removed from Vendors system or Vendor is otherwise released from
all liability related to such BINs by the applicable Network(s).

to the extent otherwise permitted by applicable law.

injunction, order, decree, or other instrument binding on Customer.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 2)  |   | _Association Service Marks_ : Customer hereby

which shall at all times be the property of Customer.  
      
    | 5)  |   | _Marketing Materials_ : Customer agrees that it shall
appropriately use the Program credit card applications and collateral
marketing materials as provided to Customer by Vendor without alteration.

employee to act as a liaison with respect to the Program and the Cards (the
"Customer Liaison"). Vendor shall work with the Customer Liaison to roll out
new Program marketing programs. Vendor shall be entitled to rely on and
accept the signature of the Customer Liaison as evidencing any
approvals required from Customer pursuant to this Addendum, including but
not limited to Vendors use of the Marks. Failure of the Customer Liaison to
respond to Vendors request for approval within thirty (30) days of request
shall be deemed an approval by Customer.  
      
    | 7)  |   | _Rules and Regulations; Compliance With Laws_ : Customer
warrants that it will abide by all the provisions in the Rules and
Regulations which may be amended from time to time and which are applicable
