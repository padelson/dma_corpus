         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 10, 2003 (this
"Agreement"), by and among Quintiles Transnational Corp., a North Carolina
corporation (the "Company"), Pharma Services Holding, Inc., a Delaware

corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub").

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of
Directors") has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company's
shareholders for Merger Sub to merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, as amended (the
"North Carolina Act"), and upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set
forth herein; and

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors, based on the unanimous recommendation
of a special committee (the "Special Committee") of the Board of Directors
formed for the purpose of representing the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, has adopted this Agreement and has determined
that the consideration to be paid for each share of Company Common Stock (as

holders of such shares and has recommended that the holders of Company Common
Stock approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and

         WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have adopted
this Agreement;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

                                  THE MERGER

         SECTION 2.1. The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section
2.3), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the North Carolina Act, Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the
name "Quintiles Transnational Corp." and shall succeed to and assume all

                                       3

<PAGE>

the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the North Carolina
Act. The Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes
referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

         SECTION 2.2. Closing. Unless this Agreement has been terminated and the
transactions herein contemplated have been abandoned pursuant to Article VIII,
and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 12:00 noon on
the first business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VII, at the offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, located at 101
Park Avenue, New York, New York 10178 (or such other place or time as Parent and
the Company may jointly designate). The date that the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date."

         SECTION 2.3. Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the
"Articles of Merger"), including a plan of merger, in accordance with Section
55-11-05 of the North Carolina Act, with the Secretary of State of the State of
North Carolina, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of, the North Carolina Act. Article II of this Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of merger" under Section 55-11-05 of the North Carolina
Act. The Merger shall become effective at the time of such filing, or such other
time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Articles of Merger
(the time of such filing, or such other time so specified, being the "Effective
Time").

         SECTION 2.4. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the North
Carolina Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 2.5. Subsequent Actions. If, at any time at or after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.6. Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers.
(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as amended and
restated as set forth in Exhibit A

                                       4

<PAGE>

attached hereto which is incorporated herein by reference, until thereafter
amended as provided by Law and such articles of incorporation.

                  (b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Law, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

                  (c) The directors of Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time will continue as the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and,
except as Merger Sub may otherwise notify the Company in writing prior to the
Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately before the Effective
Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case
until their successors are elected or appointed and qualified. If, at the
Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the board of directors or in any office
of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the
manner provided by Law.

         SECTION 2.7. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:

                  (a) Except as provided in clause (b) below, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time and any Rights associated therewith (such shares of Company Common Stock
and associated Rights are hereinafter referred to, together, as the "Shares")
(other than Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders (as defined in Section 2.10),
if any) shall be converted into the right to receive $14.50 (the "Per Share
Amount") in cash payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender
of the certificate representing such Share or an affidavit with respect thereto,
in each case in accordance with Section 2.8. As of the Effective Time, all
Shares so converted shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
or certificates representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount applicable
thereto, in accordance with Section 2.8.

                  (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, any Shares acquired by Parent
pursuant to the Rollover Agreements) shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no cash, Company Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

                  (c) Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall be converted into and
become 1,250,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 2.8. Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books. (a) Before the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with a bank or trust
company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") to receive
the funds necessary

                                       5

<PAGE>

to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a). The Surviving Corporation
shall, at the Effective Time, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of holders of Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time, funds in an amount sufficient for the payments under Section
2.8(b) to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to
Section 2.7(a). Such funds shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed
by the Surviving Corporation, provided however that such funds may only be
invested in (i) obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, (ii)
commercial paper rated A-1, P-1 or A-2, P-2 and (iii) time deposits with,
including certificates of deposits issued by, any office located in the United
States of any bank or trust company organized under Federal Law or under the Law
of any state of the United States or of the District of Columbia and that has
capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $500,000,000. Any net profits
resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be
payable to the Surviving Corporation.

                  (b) The Surviving Corporation agrees that as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time it shall cause the Exchange Agent to
distribute to holders of record of Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time a form of letter of transmittal and instructions for its use in effecting
the surrender of the certificates representing the Shares in exchange for the
aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto in customary form to be agreed to by
Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon the surrender of
certificates representing the Shares together with a properly executed letter of
transmittal, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay the
holder of such certificates in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such
certificate or certificates. Until so surrendered, each such certificate (other
than certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock held by the
Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub) shall represent solely the right to
receive the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto.

                  (c) If payment of cash in respect of canceled Shares is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered certificate
or instrument is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
certificate or instrument so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such
payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate or
instrument surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not payable.

                  (d) If any certificate or certificates representing Shares
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such certificate or certificates to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate or certificates, the Exchange Agent will pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates the Per
Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such certificate
or certificates payable pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of
transfers of any shares of capital

                                       6

stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates for Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in Section 2.7(a). No interest
shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of a certificate
or certificates which immediately before the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares.

                  (f) Promptly following the date which is twelve months after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation may cause the Exchange Agent to
deliver to the Surviving Corporation all cash, certificates and other documents
in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and any
holder of a certificate or certificates representing Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Amount multiplied by the
number of Shares represented by such certificate or certificates, subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Thereafter, each holder
of a certificate or certificates formerly representing Shares that did not
receive the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto may surrender such
certificate or certificates to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive in
consideration thereof the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such certificate or certificates, without any interest or
dividends thereon.

                  (g) None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof,
shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash delivered by the Exchange Agent
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

                  (h) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of a
certificate or certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares exchanged for cash theretofore represented by
such certificate or certificates.

                  (i) The Per Share Amount paid in the Merger shall be net to
the holder of Shares in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable
back-up withholding or, as set forth in Section 2.8(c), stock transfer Taxes
payable by such holder.

                  (j) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses of the Exchange Agent.

         SECTION 2.9. Option Plans; Stock Purchase Plans. (a) Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary so that all
options then outstanding to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stock Options") heretofore granted under any plan, arrangement or
agreement (collectively, the "Option Plans") shall become fully vested and
exercisable (whether or not currently exercisable) and, at the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option not theretofore exercised shall be canceled. Except as
provided in a Rollover Agreement, and subject to the following sentence and
Section 2.9(b), each holder of a Company Stock Option that is canceled pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall, in respect of each Company Stock Option, be
entitled to a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation in an amount equal to
(i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Amount over (y) the

                                       7

<PAGE>

applicable exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock for which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to
such cancellation. The foregoing cash payment shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation upon or as soon as practicable after (A) such holder's surrender of
all Company Stock Options held by such holder or (B) delivery by such holder of
such holder's written agreement or acknowledgement that all Company Stock
Options held by such holder have been cancelled as a result of the Merger in
exchange for such cash payment.

                  (b) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.9 to any
holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code (as defined in Section 4.10(c)), or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving
Corporation.

                  (c) The Company's stock purchase plans, including without
limitation, the Company's 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, shall be modified,
terminated and/or suspended so that no purchase of Company Common Stock shall
occur after the date hereof. With respect to the Company's 1999 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, the rights of participants thereunder with respect to any
offering period then underway shall be determined by shortening the offering
period so that the last day of such offering period shall be the last day of the
Company's last full payroll period on or before the date hereof and by making
such other appropriate adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period and otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a fully
effective and completed offering period for all purposes under such plan.

                  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions that are necessary or appropriate to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.9(c).

         SECTION 2.10. Dissenters' Rights. Any Dissenting Shareholder which
perfects its appraisal rights pursuant to Article 13 of the North Carolina Act
shall have the right to receive payment as provided in such Article for its
Shares. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, all Shares held by such
Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be treated as though such Shares had been
converted into the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares held by
such Dissenting Shareholder pursuant to Section 2.7(a) hereof, without interest
or dividends thereon. As used herein, "Dissenting Shareholders" means holders of
Shares exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Article 13 of the North Carolina
Act. As long as the Company Common Stock is traded on a national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market as of the record date for the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, then no holders of Shares shall be entitled to rights of
dissent and appraisal pursuant to Article 13 of the North Carolina Act.

amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities
Act"), (ii) the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the requirements of any relevant

contemplated hereby. Except for the Required Parent Consents, no waiver,
consent, approval or authorization of any Governmental Entity is required to be
obtained or made by either Parent or Merger Sub in connection with its
respective execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, except where
the failure to obtain such waiver, consent, approval or authorization would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.5. Financing Arrangements. (a) Parent has delivered to the
Company a true and complete copy of the commitment letter, dated April 10, 2003,
addressed to Parent (the "Debt Commitment Letter") from Citicorp North America,
Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (collectively, "Citigroup") pursuant to
which Citigroup has indicated that it is committed to provide $875,000,000 in
debt financing (the "Debt Financing"), subject to the terms and conditions
therein, for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated hereby. As
of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified or
withdrawn and is in full force and effect. All commitment fees required to be
paid thereunder have been paid in full or will be duly paid in full when due,
and, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred that (with or without
notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a default thereunder on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or Citigroup, as the case may be. As of the date hereof,
Citigroup has not advised Parent or Merger Sub of any facts or circumstances
and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Article IV, as of the date hereof, Parent or Merger Sub know of no
facts or circumstances, that cause them to believe the financings contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter will not be consummated substantially in
accordance with the terms thereof.

                  (b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete
copy of the commitment letter, dated April 10, 2003, addressed to Parent from
One Equity Partners LLC ("OEP") pursuant to which OEP has committed to provide
an aggregate of $415,700,000 (the "Equity Financing"), subject to the terms and
conditions therein, for purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated
hereby (collectively, the "Equity Commitment Letter"). As of the date hereof,
the Equity Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified or withdrawn and is
in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, OEP has not advised Parent or
Merger Sub of any

                                       10

<PAGE>

facts or circumstances and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in Article IV, as of the date hereof, Parent
or Merger Sub know of no facts or circumstances that cause them to believe the
financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter will not be consummated
substantially in accordance with the terms thereof.

                  (c) The aggregate proceeds of the financings contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter, when taken together and
provided the Company has unrestricted cash available to be used by the Surviving
Corporation to pay a portion of the aggregate Per Share Amount at the Effective
Time, after giving effect to any Taxes paid or payable in connection with the
Company's making such cash available for such payment, of not less than
$585,900,000, are sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount for the
Shares pursuant to Article II, to pay all amounts required to be paid to holders
of Company Stock Options hereunder, to refinance any Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the date of this Agreement that may
become due as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
pay all related fees and expenses.

         SECTION 3.6. Solvency. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is able to pay its
debts generally as they become due and is solvent and will not be, nor will the
Surviving Corporation be, as of the Effective Time, rendered insolvent as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, the Debt
Financing and the Equity Financing. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, (i) admitted in writing that it is or may become
unable to pay its debts generally as they become due, (ii) filed or consented to
the filing against it of a petition in bankruptcy or a petition to take
advantage of an insolvency act, (iii) made an assignment for the benefit of its
creditors, (iv) consented to the appointment of a receiver for itself or for the
whole or any substantial part of its property, (v) had a petition in bankruptcy
filed against it, (vi) been adjudged as bankrupt or filed a petition or answer
seeking reorganization or arrangement under the Federal bankruptcy Laws or any
Law or statute of the United States of America or any other jurisdiction, or
(vii) incurred or reasonably should have believed it would incur, debts that are
or will be beyond its ability to pay as such debts mature. Parent and Merger Sub
are not engaged, nor currently contemplate being engaged, in a business or
transaction for which any property remaining with them would be insufficient to
continue to operate their businesses or to pay their debts generally as they
come due.

         SECTION 3.7. Legal Proceedings. (a) As of the date hereof, there are no
claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations (collectively, "Actions")
pending (or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened) against Parent or Merger
Sub that would materially and adversely affect Parent's or Merger Sub's ability
to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (b) As of the date hereof, there is no order, writ, injunction
or judgment to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject that would materially and
adversely affect Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (c) To the knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this
Agreement, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent is pending or threatened,
other than any investigation or review that

                                       11


<PAGE>

would not materially and adversely affect Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.8. Status as a Control Person. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub,
together with their respective Affiliates, beneficially owns (as that term is
defined by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
under either Section 13(d) or 16 of the Exchange Act) 10% or more of the shares
of any class of equity or convertible securities of the Company.

         SECTION 3.9. No Prior Activities. Except for Liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limitation, the Debt Financing and Equity Financing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has incurred any Liabilities, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has engaged in any business or activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person or
entity.

         SECTION 3.10. Brokers. No broker, finder, investment banker or other
Person is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         Except as set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 or in the exhibits thereto or incorporated
therein, or in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent on the
date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), which exceptions shall
apply to each of the following representations and warranties (to the extent the
matters set forth in such Annual Report, exhibits or Company Disclosure Letter
would be reasonably likely to apprise Parent and Merger Sub that such matters be
excepted from such representation and warranty), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

         SECTION 4.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) The
Company is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is
qualified to transact business and, where applicable, is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of
the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing does not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 4.1(b)).
The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies of
the articles of incorporation and the bylaws (or comparable organization
documents, as applicable), each as amended to date, of the Company and its
Significant Subsidiaries. Such articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents, as applicable) are in full force and
effect. Each of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is not in material

                                       12


<PAGE>

violation of any of the provisions of its respective articles of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organization documents, as applicable).

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any change, event or effect that is or would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the business, operations, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company (including, for purposes of
this definition, the Surviving Corporation) and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and as currently conducted, except for any such change, event or effect
constituting, resulting from or arising out of (i) changes, events or
developments in or affecting the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, healthcare,
contract research, contract sales, drug development and healthcare informatics
industries generally, including changes in the use, adoption or non-adoption of
technologies or industry standards, which, in each case, do not have a
materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (ii) any failure by the Company to meet analysts' published revenue or
earnings predictions for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings
are released) on or after the date of this Agreement which would not otherwise
be the result of a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that the
changes, events or developments giving rise or contributing to such failure may
be taken into account in determining whether there has been, or will be, a
Material Adverse Effect), (iii) changes, events or developments in the financial
or securities markets generally, or the economy in general, which, in each case,
do not have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) any Change of Law (as defined below), (v)
changes in foreign currency rates, (vi) any adverse change relating to changes
in generally accepted accounting principles as in effect on the date hereof in
the United States, (vii) the negotiation, announcement, execution, delivery,
performance, consummation or anticipation of the transactions contemplated by,
or compliance with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or
(viii) any Actions or Orders which in any manner challenge, seek to prevent,
enjoin, alter or delay, or seek damages as a result of or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby.

         For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any
Person, any corporation or other legal entity of which such Person (either alone
or through or together with any other Subsidiary) (i) owns, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests the holders of
which are generally entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors
or other governing body of such corporation or other legal entity, (ii) in the
case of a limited liability company or a partnership, serves as managing member
or general partner, as the case may be, or owns a majority of the equity
interests, or (iii) otherwise has the ability to elect a majority of the
directors, trustees or managing members thereof.

         "Change of Law" shall mean the adoption, implementation, promulgation,
repeal, modification, reinterpretation or proposal of any Law, rule, regulation,
ordinance, order, protocol, practice or measure or any other requirement of Law
of or by any Federal, state, county or local government, governmental agency,
court, commission, department or similar organization or other such entity which
occurs subsequent to the date hereof.

         SECTION 4.2. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 25,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of which 1,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock (the
"Company Preferred Stock"), and

                                       13


<PAGE>

500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Company
Common Stock" and, together with the Company Preferred Stock, the "Company
Stock"). As of April 9, 2003, 118,297,470 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, all of which shares of Company Common Stock were validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of
the date hereof, no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding.

                  (b) As of the date hereof, (i) 36,856,302 shares of Company
Common Stock were authorized for issuance under the terms of the Option Plans of
which, as of April 9, 2003, Company Stock Options to purchase 34,286,088 shares
of Company Common Stock were granted and are currently outstanding and (ii)
there were outstanding rights (the "Rights") with respect to each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock under the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement
(the "Rights Agreement"), dated as of November 5, 1999, and amended and restated
as of May 4, 2000, between the Company and First Union National Bank.

                  (c) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, contracts, rights or warrants, including any right of
conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or other
agreement, obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue
additional shares of Company Stock (collectively, "Options"). Except for the
Rights Agreement, there are no outstanding share appreciation rights, phantom
share rights or similar rights with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no voting trusts, irrevocable proxies or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party or is bound with respect to the voting of any shares of
Company Stock.

         SECTION 4.3. Investments. Except for the capital stock or other
ownership interests of its Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any shares of outstanding capital stock or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for capital stock of any other corporation or any equity or
other participating interest in the revenues or profits of any Person. There are
no restrictions of any kind which prevent or restrict the payment of dividends
by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (other than statutory Laws of general
applicability).

         SECTION 4.4. Subsidiaries. Each direct and indirect Significant
Subsidiary of the Company is listed on Schedule 4.4 of the Company Disclosure
Letter. Each Significant Subsidiary is duly organized and validly existing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Each Significant Subsidiary of the
Company is qualified to transact business, and, where applicable, is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except in all cases where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
does not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All
of the outstanding capital shares or other equity interests of each Significant
Subsidiary of the Company are validly issued, and where such Significant
Subsidiary is a corporation, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly
or indirectly by the Company. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants,
voting trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or
arrangements to which the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is a
party relating to the issuance, sale, voting or transfer of any capital shares
or

                                       14


<PAGE>

other interests of any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, including any
right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or
agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Significant Subsidiary" shall have
the meaning set forth for the term "Significant Subsidiary" in Rule 1-02(w) of
Regulation S-X promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

         SECTION 4.5. Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Company has the
necessary corporate power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement
and, subject to obtaining any necessary shareholder approval for the Merger, to
carry out its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company (including, without limitation, the unanimous
approval of the Special Committee), subject to the approval of this Agreement by
the Company's shareholders in accordance with the North Carolina Act. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Merger Sub and Parent, constitutes
a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) Laws of general application relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors and (ii) rules of Law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

         SECTION 4.6. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) Assuming
that all Required Governmental Consents (as defined below) are obtained, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Company will not, (i) conflict with or violate any Law or Order applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or affected, (ii) assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in
Section 3.8, violate or conflict with the Restated Articles, or (iii) result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or result in any, or give rise to
any rights of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligations or
any loss of any material benefit under or, result in the creation of a lien or
encumbrance on any of the properties or assets (whether owned or leased) of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Company Material Contract
(as defined in Section 4.16) or Lease (as defined in Section 4.12), except in
the case of clauses (i) and (iii) for conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
losses or liens which, individually or in the aggregate, do not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, (ii) the requirements of the HSR Act and

order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under

         SECTION 4.9. Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, or Orders entered, against or
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (a) which if adversely determined would
have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) which as of the date hereof in any manner

has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each Company Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Code") and its related trust that has not been
revoked, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances or
events that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to result in a
revocation of such letter, which cannot be cured without the occurrence of a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d) Except as does not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect: (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied,
and are now in compliance, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all Laws
and regulations applicable to the Company Benefit Plans and each Company Benefit
Plan has been administered in all respects in accordance with its terms, and
(ii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted against the Company Benefit
Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Company Benefit Plan participant, to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Treasury, the
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or any Company Benefit Plan.

                  (e) Except as does not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect or as otherwise provided in Section 2.9(a) hereof,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in conjunction with another
event (e.g., termination of employment) will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
material payment or material benefit to any employee, officer or director of the
Company under any Company Benefit Plan.

                  (f) No Material Company Benefit Plan (i) is a "defined benefit
plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA, (ii) is described in

coverage (other than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
or Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable Law), or (iv) is a plan
described in Section 413(a) or 413(c) of the Code or Section 3(40) of ERISA.

                  (g) The Company is not a member of any controlled group,
within the meaning of Section 412(n)(6)(B) of the Code with any entity other
than any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no circumstances pursuant to which
the Company or any Subsidiary thereof could be liable (either directly,
secondarily, jointly or contingently) under Title IV of ERISA or Sections 4971
through 4980E of the Code or under Section 502(i) or (1) of ERISA.

                                       19
<PAGE>

                  (h) No Material Company Benefit Plan holds Company Common
Stock, and the terms of such plans will not in any way prevent the completion of
the Merger.

                  (i) Except as does not have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan established
or maintained outside the United States of America that is not subject to ERISA,
(i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
obligation in connection with the termination or withdrawal from any such
Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) the present value of the accrued benefit
liabilities (whether or not vested) under each such plan which is funded,
determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year of the Company
on the basis of reasonable actuarial assumptions, did not exceed the current
value of the assets of such plan, and for each such plan which is not funded,
the obligations thereunder have been accrued in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States as of the end
of the most recently ended fiscal year of the Company.

         SECTION 4.11. Owned Real Property. Schedule 4.11 sets forth a complete
and accurate list of the real property owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property"). The Company or one of its Subsidiaries
has good fee simple title (or other similar title in jurisdictions outside the
United States) to the Owned Real Property free and clear of any liens, security
interests, encumbrances or defects, except for such liens, security interests,
encumbrances or defects as, individually or in the aggregate, do not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.12. Leases. (a) Schedule 4.12 sets forth a list of all
material leases, subleases and occupancy agreements, together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, with respect to all real properties in which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has a leasehold interest, whether as
lessor or lessee (each, a "Lease" and collectively, the "Leases"; the property
covered by Leases under which the Company or such Subsidiary is a lessee is
referred to herein as the "Leased Real Property").


                  (b) Each Lease is in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under any Lease and, to the
actual knowledge of the Company, without independent inquiry or investigation,
no other party to a Lease is in default, except for such defaults of the Company
or any other party which, individually or in the aggregate, do not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.13. Intellectual Property. The Company or its Subsidiaries
own, or are licensed or otherwise possess legal enforceable rights to use all
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights and any applications
therefor, technology, know-how, trade secrets, computer software programs or
applications, domain names and tangible or intangible proprietary information or
materials that are used in the respective businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted (collectively, the "Intellectual Property"),
except for any such failures to own, be licensed or possess that do not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company, all material patents, trademarks, trade names, service
marks and copyrights held by the Company or its Subsidiaries are valid and
subsisting. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not infringing any intellectual
property rights of any other Person, except for such infringements which do not,
individually or

                                       20

<PAGE>

in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. No claim is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to the ownership, validity,
license or use of, or any infringement resulting from, the Intellectual
Property, which if adversely determined would, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Company, the
Intellectual Property is not being infringed by any other Person except for any
such infringements which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. There are no restrictions on the direct or indirect
transfer of any Intellectual Property that would be triggered by the
transactions contemplated hereby other than such restrictions which do not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.14. Insurance. Except as, individually or in the aggregate,
do not have a Material Adverse Effect:

                  (a) all material insurance policies carried by or covering the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to their business, assets and
properties are in full force and effect, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no notice of cancellation has been given with respect to any such policy;

                  (b) all material insurance policies of the Company will be in
full force and effect as of the Effective Time;

                  (c) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
assigned, pledged or transferred any rights under any such insurance policies;

                  (d) there are no claims by the Company or any Subsidiary under
any such policy or instrument as to which any insurance company is denying
Liability or defending under a reservation of rights clause (other than a
customary reservation of rights clause); and

                  (e) all necessary notifications of claims have been made to
insurance carriers.

         SECTION 4.15. Environmental. (a)(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with all, and have no Liability under, any applicable
Environmental Laws, except where failure to be in compliance does not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                           (ii) There is no claim with respect to Environmental
Laws pending or, or the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances which
could give rise to such a claim that has, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

                           (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has, either expressly or by operation of Law, assumed or undertaken, or agreed
to assume or undertake, responsibility for any Liability or obligation of any
other Person, arising under or relating to Environmental Laws, including but not
limited to, any obligation for investigation, corrective or remedial action,
which in each case has a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
meanings set forth below:

                                       21
<PAGE>

                           (i) "Environmental Law" means any Federal, state,
local, provincial, foreign, civil and criminal Law, statute, ordinances, common
Law, rules, regulations, policies and guidance documents with the effect of Law,
now in effect and as amended, and any judicial or administrative interpretation
thereof, including any judicial or administrative order, consent decree or
judgment, relating to pollution, health, worker health and safety or protection
of the environment, including, without limitation, those relating to the use,
handling, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, release, exposure or
discharge of Hazardous Substances.

                           (ii) "Hazardous Substances" means (a) petroleum and
petroleum products, by-products or breakdown products, radioactive materials,
asbestos-containing materials and polychlorinated biphenyls, and (b) any other
chemicals, materials or substances regulated as toxic or hazardous or as a
pollutant, contaminant or waste under any applicable Environmental Law.

         SECTION 4.16. Material Contracts. All Contracts of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company that (a) have been filed as an exhibit to any SEC
Report in compliance with Item 601(a)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Securities Act, (b) relate to any Indebtedness in excess of $10,000,000, (c)
provide for aggregate payments to or from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in excess of $10,000,000, have an unexpired term exceeding one year and can not
be terminated without penalty upon 60 or less days prior written notice, or (d)
materially limit the freedom of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
compete in any line of business or with any Person or in any geographical area
or which would so materially limit the freedom of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries so to compete after the Effective Time (collectively, the "Company
Material Contracts") are valid and binding and are in full force and effect and
enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in
accordance with their respective terms, except as to the effect, if any, of (i)
applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally (ii) rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief
and other equitable remedies and (iii) to the extent applicable, the
enforceability of provisions regarding indemnification in connection with the
sale or issuance of securities. The Company Material Contracts, other than those
filed as an exhibit or incorporated by reference to any SEC Report, are listed
on Schedule 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that with
respect to any Company Material Contract described in clause (d) above, in the
case of agreements of any Subsidiary of the Company, such agreements that do not
have a Material Adverse Effect are not required to be listed on Schedule 4.16 of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in violation
or breach of or default under any such Company Material Contract where such
violation, breach or default, individually or in the aggregate, has a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.17. Compliance with Laws/Permits. (a) Neither the Company nor
any of its Significant Subsidiaries has violated, is in violation of, or has
been given written notice of any violation of any applicable provisions of any
Laws applicable thereto, except for any violations which do not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The Company and its Significant Subsidiaries have all
permits, licenses, approvals and other authorizations from applicable
Governmental Entities required in

                                       22
<PAGE>

connection with the operation of their respective businesses or the ownership of
their respective properties (collectively, "Company Permits"), except those the
absence of which do not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.18. Taxes. (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely filed, or caused to be timely filed, all Tax Returns (as defined in
Section 4.18(b)) required to be filed by it, and has paid, collected or
withheld, or caused to be paid, collected or withheld, all Taxes (as defined in
Section 4.18(b)) required to be paid by them (whether or not shown on such Tax
Returns as being required to be paid, collected or withheld), other than such
Taxes for which specific reserves in the Company Financial Statements have been
established or which are being contested in good faith, except where a failure
to so file, pay, collect or withhold does not in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect. There are no claims or assessments pending against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and the
Company has not been notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or
assessments against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than, in each
case, claims or assessments for which adequate reserves in the Company Financial
Statements have been established or which are being contested in good faith and
set forth on Schedule 4.18 of the Company Disclosure Letter or are immaterial in
amount), except for claims or assessments which if successfully asserted would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any waivers or extensions of any
applicable statute of limitations to assess any material amount of Taxes. There
are no outstanding requests by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return or within which
to pay any material amounts of Taxes shown to be due on any Tax Return. There
are no material Liens for Taxes upon the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable and
Liens for Taxes that are being contested in good faith. None of the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof is a party to any agreement or arrangement that would
reasonably be expected to result, separately or in the aggregate, in the actual
or deemed payment (including any payment made pursuant to Section 2.9 of this
Agreement) by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or that would be
nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. None of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof has been a United States real property holding corporation
within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. All Taxes required to be
withheld, collected or deposited by or with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been timely withheld, collected or deposited, as the case may
be, and, to the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing
authority, except, in each case, to the extent that failing to withhold,
collect, deposit or pay does not have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to include in income any
adjustment pursuant to Section 481 (a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
Law or regulations) by reason of a change in accounting method.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean all
Federal, foreign, state or local income, gross receipts, windfall profits, value
added, severance, property, production, transfer sales, use, license, excise,
franchise, employment, withholding, value added, unemployment, disability,
occupancy or other taxes, duty, tax related assessment of any kind whatsoever
together with any associated interest, additions, fines, additional amounts or
penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or
penalties, and "Tax Returns"

                                       23
<PAGE>

shall mean all reports and returns (including elections, claims, declarations,
disclosures, schedules, computations and information returns) required to be
filed with respect to Taxes.

         SECTION 4.19. Rights Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger will not result in a "Triggering Event," a
"Distribution Date" or a "Stock Acquisition Date" under the Rights Agreement.
The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger will not
result in Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates being an
"Acquiring Person" under the Rights Agreement or otherwise result in the ability
of any Person to exercise any Rights or enable or require the Rights to separate

         SECTION 4.22. Recommendation of Special Committee and Board of
Directors Opinion of Financial Advisor. (a) The Special Committee, at a meeting
duly called and held, unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the shareholders of the Company other than Dennis B. Gillings,
Ph.D. and his Affiliates and certain other shareholders of the Company who may

determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair
to, and in the best interests of, the shareholders of the Company, (ii) approved
this Agreement and transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) resolved to

shareholders of the Company.

                  (c) Morgan Stanley has rendered to the Special Committee a
written opinion, dated as of the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Per Share
Amount to be received by the shareholders of the Company is fair from a
financial point of view to such holders other than the holders of Excluded
Shares (as defined in such opinion), a complete and correct written copy of
which has been delivered to Parent. The Company has received the approval of
Morgan Stanley to permit

                                       24

the inclusion of a copy of its written opinion in its entirety in the Proxy

holders of any class or series of the Company's securities necessary to approve
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 4.25. Customers. Since January 1, 2003, neither the Company nor

         SECTION 4.26. Related Party Transactions. Since January 1, 2002, the
Company has not entered into any relationship or transaction of the sort that
would be required to be disclosed by the Company pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K of the Securities Act.

         SECTION 4.27. Employees; Labor Relations. (a) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement or other contract or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization; and (b) except as does not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect, there is no (i) unfair labor practice, labor dispute

proceeding by a labor union or representative thereof to organize any employees

                                   ARTICLE V.

                     CONDUCT OF BUSINESS PENDING THE MERGER

National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or

                  (j) agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions
described in Sections 5.1 (a) through (i) above.

         SECTION 5.2. No Solicitation. (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives (as defined in
Section 5.2 (b)) to, immediately cease any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.2 (c)).

                  (b) The Company shall not, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries
and the officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Representatives")
not to, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the submission of, any
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to, or
take any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of, any proposal that

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consulting with and considering advice from its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that the failure to do so would create a reasonable likelihood of a
breach of their duties as directors to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Law, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that the Board of

                                       27
<PAGE>

Directors or the Special Committee concludes is reasonably likely to result in a
Company Superior Proposal, and subject to compliance with Section 5.2(d), (x)
furnish information with respect to the Company to such Third Party pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement not more favorable to such Third Party than the
Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent (as determined by the Special Committee
after consultation with its outside counsel) and (y) participate in negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

                  (c) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the
meanings set forth below:

                           (i) "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
proposal or offer, whether in writing or otherwise, pursuant to which a Third
Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership
(as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of 10% or more of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or 10% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets,
tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction with respect to the Company,
including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related
transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party to acquire
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), or 10% or more of the equity interest in the
Company.

                           (ii) "Third Party" means any Person or group other
than Parent or Merger Sub.

                  (d) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2 and to the extent
applicable, subject to the provisions of Article VIII, neither the Board of
Directors nor the Special Committee shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors or the Special Committee of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (any such agreement, a "Company Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained in this
Agreement, in the event that prior to the Effective Time, the Company receives a
Company Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors or the Special Committee
determines in good faith, after consulting with and considering advice from its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that the failure to do so would create a
reasonable likelihood of a breach of their duties as directors to the Company's
shareholders under applicable Law, the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee may (subject to this and the following sentences) (x) withdraw or
modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger or (y)
approve or recommend a Company Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined), but
in each case, only at a time that is at least 72 hours following delivery to
Parent (and all Persons to whom copies of notices are required to be given
pursuant to the means set forth in Section 9.3(i)) of a written notice advising
Parent that the Board of Directors has received a Company Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal
and identifying the Person making such Company Superior Proposal and during
which 72 hour period the Company will in good faith cooperate and negotiate with
Parent, on a non-

                                       28
<PAGE>

exclusive basis, with the intent of enabling the parties hereto to agree to a
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal (but
changing references to the 10% amounts in the definition thereof to 51%) on
terms which the Board of Directors and the Special Committee determine in their
good faith judgment (after consultation with their advisors) is reasonably
likely to be consummated and would, if consummated, be more favorable to the
Company's shareholders entitled to receive the Per Share Amount than the Merger
(taking into account any factors relating to such proposed transaction deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors and the Special Committee, including, without
limitation, the financing thereof and all other conditions thereto).

                  (e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) of this Section 5.2, the Company (i) shall promptly,
but in no event no later than 24 hours after the receipt thereof, advise Parent
orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) promptly, but in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt thereof, provide to Parent (and all notice parties of Parent) any
non-public information provided to such Third Party that was not previously
provided to Parent and (iii) keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of any
material developments relating to any Acquisition Proposal no later than 24
hours after such development.

                  (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other
provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors or the
Special Committee from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(provided, that no such position shall be a favorable recommendation of such
transaction if it does not constitute a Company Superior Proposal) or (ii)
making such disclosure to the Company's shareholders as, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, is
required under applicable Law.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         SECTION 6.1. Shareholders Meeting; Proxy Statement. (a) In accordance
with the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation ("Restated
Articles") and Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Restated Bylaws"), the Company
shall call and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable for
the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Merger and this Agreement, and
the Company shall use its best efforts to hold such shareholder meeting as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement (as defined
below) is cleared by the SEC. As promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and prepare and
file with the SEC, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have
cleared by the SEC, and promptly thereafter shall mail to shareholders, a proxy
statement meeting the requirements of Schedule 14A and Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act (including any preliminary versions thereof, any amendments thereto
and any schedules required to be filed in connection therewith) (the "Proxy
Statement") in connection with the meeting of the Company's shareholders to
consider the Merger (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting"). The Company, Parent
and Merger Sub each will promptly

                                       29
<PAGE>

and timely provide all information relating to its respective businesses or
operations necessary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to satisfy all
requirements of applicable state and Federal securities Laws. The Company and
Parent (with respect to Parent and Merger Sub) each shall be solely responsible
for any statement, information or omission in the Proxy Statement relating to it
(and Merger Sub with respect to Parent) or its Affiliates based upon written
information furnished by it (or Merger Sub with respect to Parent) for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement.

                  (b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will not, at
the time the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed
with the SEC or first sent to shareholders, at the time of the Company
Shareholders' Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, taken as a whole and in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
that no representation, warranty or covenant is hereby made, or will be made, by
the Company with respect to Parent and Merger Sub Information (as defined in
Section 6.1(c)) or any information supplied by Dennis B. Gillings, Ph.D. that
relates to him or that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement as a
result of his status as an affiliate under Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act.

                  (c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective
officers, directors, representatives, agents or employees (the "Parent and
Merger Sub Information"), for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or first sent to
shareholders, at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting or at the
Effective Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, taken as a whole and in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation,
warranty or covenant is hereby made, or will be made, by Parent or Merger Sub
with respect to information supplied by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, representatives, agents or employees.

         SECTION 6.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, shall furnish such information concerning its businesses,
properties and personnel as Parent shall reasonably request; provided, however,
such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
respective operations and must be conducted in accordance with the procedures
established by the Company. All nonpublic information provided to, or obtained
by, Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations under that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 6, 2002, by and between the Company and
GF Management Company, LLC (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and
effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to
provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to
Parent by reason of applicable Law, rules or regulations, which constitutes
information

                                       30
<PAGE>

protected by attorney/client privilege, or which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement
or other obligation to third parties. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, each party hereto (and each employee, representative
or other agent of any party) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of any and all
transactions contemplated herein and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other Tax analyses) that are or have been provided to any party (or
to any employee, representative or other agent of any party) relating to such
Tax treatment or Tax structure, provided, however, that this authorization of
disclosure shall not apply to restrictions reasonably necessary to comply with
securities Laws. If Parent or Merger Sub discovers any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, the nature of which
would cause the condition to the obligations of the Company relating to
representations and warranties set forth in Section 7.2 to not be satisfied, or
any circumstance or condition that upon the Effective Time would constitute such
a breach, Parent and Merger Sub covenant that they will promptly so inform the
Company. If the Company discovers any breach of any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement, the nature of which would cause the condition to
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub relating to representations and
warranties set forth in Section 7.3 to not be satisfied, or any circumstance or
condition that upon the Effective Time would constitute such a breach, the
Company covenants that it will promptly so inform Parent.

         SECTION 6.3. Public Announcements. The parties shall issue a joint
initial press release announcing the execution of this Agreement as may be
mutually agreed. Thereafter, the parties will consult with one another prior to
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public communications in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will provide each other with a meaningful opportunity to review
and comment upon, any such press releases or other public communications, and
prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties will consult with one another prior to making such
filings and will provide each other with a meaningful opportunity to review and
comment upon, such filings, except as may be required by Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service.

         SECTION 6.4. Approvals and Consents; Reasonable Best Efforts;
Cooperation. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly apply for, diligently pursue
through to completion, and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain prior to Effective Time all consents, approvals, authorizations and
clearances of Governmental Entities and third parties required of it to
consummate the Merger, (ii) provide such information and communications to
Governmental Entities as such Persons may reasonably request, and (iii) assist
and cooperate with the other parties hereto to obtain all permits and clearances
of Governmental Entities that are reasonably necessary, and to prepare any
document or other information reasonably required of it by any such Persons to
consummate the Merger.

                  (b) In addition to the other obligations set forth in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 6.4 and Section 6.7, from
and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable

                                       31
<PAGE>

best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws,
regulations or otherwise to consummate and make effective as expeditiously as
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including without limitation, (i) filing as soon as practicable after
the date hereof (the "Filing Date") a Notification and Report Form under the HSR
Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice (and filing as soon as practicable
any form or report required by any other Governmental Entity relating to
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation matters, including without
limitation, any relevant foreign antitrust authority), (ii) promptly applying
for, diligently pursuing through to completion, and using reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time all consents, approvals,
authorizations, permits and clearances of Governmental Entities and third
parties required of it to consummate the Merger, (iii) providing such
information and communications to Governmental Entities as they may reasonably
request, (iv) effecting all necessary registrations, filings and submissions and
using reasonable best efforts to have lifted any injunction, order or decree of
a court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal
bar to consummation of the Merger or otherwise restraining or prohibiting the
consummation thereof (and, in such case, proceeding with the consummation of the
Merger as expeditiously as practicable), including through all possible appeals,
unless waived by the Company and Parent, (v) assisting and cooperating with each
other to obtain all permits and clearances of Governmental Entities that are
necessary, and preparing any document or other information reasonably required
of it to consummate the Merger, and (vi) executing and delivering any additional
certificates, agreements, instruments, reports, schedules, statements, consents,
documents and information necessary to consummate the Merger, and fully carrying
out the purposes of, this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, they
will not take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect or materially delay the Effective Time or the ability of any of
the parties to satisfy any of the conditions to the Effective Time or to
consummate the Merger.

                  (c) In furtherance of and without limitation of the foregoing,
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to any reasonable inquiries or requests received from any
Governmental Entity for additional information or documentation; (ii) promptly
notify the other parties hereto of any written communication to that party or
its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity and, subject to applicable Law,
permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any of the foregoing (and consider in good faith the views of the other
parties in connection therewith); and (iii) furnish the other parties with
copies of all material correspondence, filings, and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their Affiliates
and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity of their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger; all with a view towards the prompt completion of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall obligate any party to disclose
to another party any information or documentation that would constitute, in the
reasonable belief of the disclosing party, competitively sensitive confidential
information or documentation.

                  (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall divest and/or agree to
divest assets to an entity or entities satisfactory to any relevant concerned
Governmental Entity, in order to permit the consummation of the Merger at its
own expense, and with no reduction in the aggregate Per Share Amount payable for
the Shares hereunder. Parent shall pay any filing fees required to be paid in
connection with the HSR Act and any relevant foreign antitrust authority.

                  (e) In addition to the other obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company will cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with their arrangement of, and negotiation of agreements with respect to, the
Debt Financing (and any substitutions or replacements thereof) or any
alternative debt financing or alternative equity financing contemplated by
Section 6.7 hereof, including by making available to Parent and Merger Sub and
such financing sources and their representatives, personnel (including for
participation in road shows), documents and information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as may reasonably be requested by Parent or Merger Sub or such
financing sources and, if applicable, by similarly cooperating with financing
sources in connection with the offering and/or syndication of any such
financing.

         SECTION 6.5. Agreement to Defend and Indemnify; Insurance. (a) It is
understood and agreed that, subject to the limitations on indemnification
contained in the North Carolina Act and the Restated Articles, the Company
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and regardless of
whether the Merger becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall for a period of six years
following the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company or any Subsidiary (and, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, any members of any committee of the Board of Directors,
including the Special Committee) on the date hereof or at the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
Action arising out of or pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including without limitation liabilities arising under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, and in the event of any such Action
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel
selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Company or the Surviving Corporation, promptly as statements
therefor are received, and (ii) the Company and the Surviving Corporation will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). For a period of six years following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain or obtain officers' and
directors' liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who currently or
at the Effective Time are covered by the Company's officers and directors
liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than those in effect on
the date hereof in terms of coverage and amounts; provided, however, that if the
aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such period
exceed 300% of the premium paid by the Company for such insurance as of the date
of this Agreement, then the Surviving Corporation shall provide the maximum
coverage that will then be available at an annual premium equal to 300% of such
per annum rate as of the date of this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall
continue in effect the indemnification

                                       33
<PAGE>

provisions currently provided by the Restated Articles and the Restated Bylaws
for a period of not less than six years following the Effective Time. This
Section 6.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger. This covenant shall
survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.
Notwithstanding Section 9.8, this Section 6.5 is intended to be for the benefit
of and to grant third-party rights to the Indemnified Parties whether or not
they are parties to this Agreement, and each of the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.5.

                  (b) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

                  (c) Following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay all reasonable expenses,
including reasonable attorney fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified
Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this
Section 6.5.

         SECTION 6.6. Employee Benefit Matters. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent or its Affiliates shall be solely responsible for and shall honor
and satisfy all liabilities with respect to the Company Benefit Plans pursuant
to the terms of such plans, Section 2.9 hereof and applicable Law. Until the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent or its Affiliates shall provide
the employees of the Surviving Corporation and their dependents with an employee
benefit program providing welfare and pension benefits that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable to the welfare and pension benefits provided to such
persons immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable terms of
the Company Benefit Plans. Subject to the foregoing, Parent and its Affiliates
may amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans after the Effective
Time, subject to their terms and applicable Law.

         SECTION 6.7. Financing. (a) In the event that the Debt Commitment
Letter or Equity Commitment Letter is terminated under circumstances where the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 are otherwise satisfied (other than
conditions that can only be satisfied at Closing), each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative debt funding
in an amount equal to the amount to be provided pursuant to the Debt Commitment
Letter and alternative equity funding in an amount equal to the amount to be
provided pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case, on terms and
conditions substantially comparable to those provided in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, as applicable.

                  (b) Following the date hereof, any amendment, modification,
termination or cancellation of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing, or
any information (other than information which is known generally in the
financial markets) which becomes known to Parent, Merger Sub, OEP or any of
their respective officers or directors which makes any such Person reasonably
believe that it will be unlikely that the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing
will be obtained on the terms set forth in the Debt Financing Letter or the
Equity

                                       34
<PAGE>

Financing Letter, respectively, shall be promptly disclosed by Parent or Merger
Sub to the Special Committee. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective officers or directors will knowingly attempt, directly or indirectly,
to induce or encourage Citigroup or OEP or any other applicable entity not to
fund any of the financing provided for in the Debt Financing Letter or the
Equity Financing Letter, as applicable.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

Section 2.3, all other Required Governmental Consents required to be made or
obtained prior to the Effective Time by the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been made or obtained, except where
the failure to make any such filings or obtain any such Required Governmental
Consents does not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse effect on Parent in the event such Required
Governmental Consents are not obtained.

                  (c) No court or Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or writ,
judgment, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the Merger (collectively, an "Order") and no Governmental Entity
shall have instituted any proceeding which continues to be pending seeking any
such Order.

causing and would not reasonably be expected to cause, individually or in the
aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, the representations
and warranties

true and correct in all respects as of the Closing with the same effect as
though such representations and warranties were made on and as of the Closing,
except for changes permitted by this Agreement and except that any such
representation and warranty which is itself qualified as to materiality shall
not be deemed so qualified for purposes of this condition and any representation
and warranty that addresses matters only as of a certain date shall be true and
correct as of that certain date. The Company shall have received certificates
dated the Closing Date and signed by the Chairman, President or an Executive
Vice-President of each of Parent and Merger Sub, certifying that the conditions

representation and warranty to be true and correct in all respects does not
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; provided,
that any such representation and warranty which is itself qualified as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed so qualified for
purposes of this condition and any representation and warranty that addresses
matters only as of a certain date shall be true and correct as of that certain
date; and provided, further that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.2, 4.5, 4.19, 4.20, 4.22

representation and warranty contained and as written in Section 4.8(g) hereof

                  (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have received the proceeds of
the Debt Financing and Equity Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and Equity Commitment Letter (or alternative financing in accordance with
Section 6.7).

                  (c) Since the date hereof, there shall not have occurred any

Parent and Merger Sub.

                  (c) By any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, if the
shareholders of the Company fail to approve the Merger upon the taking of a vote

however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c)

warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall fail to be
true and correct such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2 with respect

obligations under this Agreement) and such failure or breach with respect to any
such representation, warranty or obligation cannot be cured or, if curable,
shall continue unremedied for a period of forty-five days after Parent has
received written notice from the Company of the occurrence of such failure or
breach (provided that in no event shall such forty-five day period extend beyond
the second day preceding the Outside Date).

                  (f) By Parent or Merger Sub, if (i) any of the representations

extend beyond the second day preceding the Outside Date).

                  (g) By Parent or Merger Sub, if (i) the Board of Directors or
the Special Committee (w) withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to Parent

shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which would reduce the

except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

         SECTION 9.12. Waiver. At any time before the Effective Time, any party

Company) (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the

parties hereto with any of their agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only as against such party and only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights. All interpretations of or actions by the Company in respect of
this Agreement shall be under the direction of, and shall require the approval
of, the Special Committee.

         SECTION 9.13. Disclosure Letters, Schedules and Exhibits. Each of the
