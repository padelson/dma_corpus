which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,

referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date,
Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated
under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary form and
substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The time of such filing and acceptance
by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by Newco and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

1.2 _The Surviving Corporation of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _
7.11_, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of
Incorporation shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation;
_provided, however_ , that, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Imperva, Inc."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 7.11_, at the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such
Bylaws.

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 



2

    

1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each
certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub
shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any Company Securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 1.4(b)_, each Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the
Certificate representing such Share or the transfer of such Uncertificated
Share in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ (or in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(d)_); 
_provided, however_ , that the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification
or other like change with respect to Shares having a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of Shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 1.4(b)(i)_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a certificate representing
Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then such
certificate shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_.

 

(ii) _Owned Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any
Company Securities, each Share that is owned by Newco, Merger Sub or the
Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Newco,
Merger Sub or the Company, in each case immediately prior to the Effective
Time (" _Owned Shares_ "), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 



3

    

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Owned Shares) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as the "
_Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware
Law with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided, however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)(i)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such Share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be (or in
the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _
2.3(d)_). The Company shall provide Newco prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to such
demand, and Newco shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Newco, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

(c) _Stock Awards of the Company_.

 

(i) _Stock Options_.

(A) To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
vested Company Option (including any Company Option that vests in connection
with the Merger) shall, without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for
any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of
this Agreement) equal to the product of: (x) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such vested
Company Option, multiplied by (y) the number of Shares issuable upon the
exercise in full of such vested Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any such
vested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such vested Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any cash
payment or other consideration being made in respect thereof. The Company
agrees to take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate this cancellation
of Company Options upon the Effective Time and to give effect to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(A)_ (including the satisfaction of the requirements
of Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act). As soon as practicable (and in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days) following the

 



4

    

 Closing, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder
of a Company Option the Option Consideration (if any), without interest and
less any applicable withholding Taxes, required to be paid to the holder of
such Company Option. The cancellation of a Company Option as provided in the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(A)_ shall be deemed the
termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder had
or may have had in respect of such Company Option.

(B) Each unvested Company Option outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (and that will not vest in connection with the Merger) shall be
cancelled and converted into the contingent right to receive at the Effective
Time, in consideration of the cancellation of such unvested Company Option,
an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of the Merger
Agreement), equal to the product of: (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of each such unvested Company
Option; and (y) the number of Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of
such unvested Company Option (the " _Contingent Option Consideration_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the exercise price per share of any such
unvested Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such unvested Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any
cash payment being made, or any contingent right to receive any cash payment
being granted, in respect thereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that such per
share Contingent Option Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective
Time but shall instead be subject to the holder remaining continuously
employed with the Surviving Corporation and satisfaction of the Original
Vesting Conditions. As soon as practicable (and in no event more than the
later of (x) ten (10) Business Days and (y) the next regularly scheduled
payroll of the Surviving Corporation) following satisfaction of the Original
Vesting Conditions, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the per
share Contingent Option Consideration, without interest and less any
applicable withholding Taxes, required to be paid to the holder of such
Company Option. The cancellation of a vested Company Option as provided in the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)(B)_ shall be deemed the
termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder had or
may have had in respect of such Company Option.

 

(ii) _RSUs_.

(A) Each vested RSU (including each vested PRSU) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any RSU that becomes a
vested RSU in connection with the Merger) shall, without any action on the
part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive, an amount in cash (without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of this Agreement) equal to the product of: (x) the
Merger Consideration and (y) the number of Shares subject to such vested RSU
(the " _RSU Consideration_ "). As soon as practicable (and in no event more
than ten (10) Business Days) following the Closing, Newco shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of a vested RSU the RSU
Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding Taxes,
required to be paid to the holder of such vested RSU;  _provided_ , _however_
, that any payment in respect of any vested RSU shall be made in compliance
with Section 409A of the Code. The cancellation of an unvested RSU as provided
in the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ shall be deemed
the termination, and satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder
had or may have had in respect of such RSU.

 



5

    

(B) Each unvested RSU (including each unvested PRSU) outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and that will not vest in connection
with the Merger) shall be cancelled and converted at the Effective Time into
the contingent right to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
unvested RSU, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to deduction
for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(f)_ of
the Merger Agreement), equal to the product of: (x) the Merger Consideration;
and (y) the number of Shares subject to such unvested RSU (the " _Contingent
RSU Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such per share Contingent
RSU Consideration shall not be paid at the Effective Time but shall instead be
subject to the holder remaining continuously employed with the Surviving
Corporation and satisfaction of the Original Vesting Conditions. As soon as
practicable (and in no event more than the later of (x) ten (10) Business Days
and (y) the next regularly scheduled payroll of the Surviving Corporation)
following satisfaction of the Original Vesting Conditions, Newco shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay the per share Contingent RSU Consideration,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, required to be
paid to the holder of such RSU; _provided_ , _however_ , that any payment in
respect of any vested RSU shall be made in compliance with Section 409A of the
Code. The cancellation of an unvested RSU as provided in the first sentence
of this _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)(B)_ shall be deemed the termination, and
satisfaction in full, of any and all rights the holder had or may have had in
respect of such RSU.

 

(C) For RSUs that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions (each, a
" _PRSU_ "), the level of achievement of the applicable performance metrics
will be determined by the Company or a committee thereof in accordance with
the Company Equity Incentive Plan and the applicable PRSU agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that such level of achievement shall not exceed the
greater of (1) target performance and (2) the actual achievement of the
performance goals attributable to such PRSUs) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and, upon such determination, the resulting vested PRSUs
and unvested PRSUs will be treated as vested RSUs pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.4(c)(ii)(A)_ and unvested RSUs pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)(B)_,
respectively.

 

(d) _Company ESPP_. Within ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof,
the Company Board or a committee thereof shall take all actions with respect
to the Company ESPP that are necessary to provide that (i) with respect to the
offering period in progress as of the date hereof under the Company ESPP (the
" _Final Offering Period_ "), all outstanding purchase rights under the Final
Offering Period shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the terms
of the Company ESPP, upon the earlier of (x) immediately prior to the

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Owned Shares
and Dissenting Shares) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). From time to time following the Effective Time as
required, Newco or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to
enable the Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable
hereunder.

 



10

    

(ii) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that is one
(1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
exchanged their Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Laws), solely as general unsecured creditors thereof, for any payment of and
claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of the Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time, or
at such earlier date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority, will, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Newco and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (excluding Owned Shares
and Dissenting Shares) (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
transfer of non-certificated Shares (excluding Owned Shares and Dissenting
Shares) represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated Shares_ ") to the
Payment Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss and indemnity in lieu
therefor) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
_Article I_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate or
Uncertificated Share, upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Payment Agent, together with (x) in the case
of Shares represented by a Certificate, surrender to the Payment Agent of such
Certificate or (y) in the case of Shares represented by book-entry, receipt of
an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request). Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, from and after the Effective Time each
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent for all purposes
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of _Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Article I_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon
the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. From
and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures,
trades effected prior to the Effective Time.

 



11

    

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.4(b)(i)_; _provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(e) _Transferred Shares_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(f) _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving
Corporation and the 102 Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under Applicable Law and the Options Tax
Ruling, if obtained. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or
withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law.

nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the

reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity

view, to such holders, and as of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has
not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. A signed copy of such opinion will be
made available to Newco, for informational purposes only, promptly after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto.

(f) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the

this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions

with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (i) violate or conflict

Financing Source is entering into the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or

performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right

4.9 _Financing_.

 

(a) Newco has delivered to the Company a complete and accurate copy of an
executed commitment letter of even date herewith (the " _Equity Commitment
Letter_ ") from the Equity Financing Source pursuant to which the Equity
Financing Source has committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth therein, equity financing for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides that the Company is an
express third-party beneficiary thereof solely for purposes of the Companys
exercise of its rights under _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)_. The Equity Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full force and effect
and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Newco and the Equity Financing
Source, fully and specifically enforceable against the parties thereto in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Limitations.

 

(b) Newco has delivered to the Company a complete and accurate copy of an
executed commitment letter of even date herewith, and the executed fee letter
related thereto of even date herewith (which such fee letter may be redacted
with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps, original issue discount provisions,
"flex" and other economic terms, so long as no redaction covers terms that
would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or termination
of the Debt Financing), together with any related engagement letters,
exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements,
in each case from the Commitment Parties (as defined therein) (collectively,
the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment
Letter, the " _Financing Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which the agents,
arrangers, managers, lenders and other entities party thereto (other than
Newco or Merger Sub) and the parties to any joinder agreements, credit
agreements or other definitive agreements relating thereto (together with
their respective affiliates and their respective affiliates officers,
directors, employees, controlling persons, agents and Representatives and
their respective successors and assigns, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ " and
together with the Equity Financing Source, the " _Financing Sources_ ")
has/have committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein, debt financing for the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Debt
Financing_ " and together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Any
reference in this Agreement to (i) " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ," " _Debt
Commitment Letters_ " or " _Financing Commitment Letters_ " will include such
documents as amended or modified in compliance with the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and (ii) the " _Financing_ " will include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3_. As of the
date of this Agreement, Newco has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any
and all commitment fees or other fees that have been incurred and are due and
payable in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, and Newco will pay, or cause to be paid, when due all
other commitment fees and other fees arising under the Financing Commitment
Letters as and when they become due and payable thereunder. The Debt
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full force
and effect as of the date hereof, and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Newco and, to the knowledge of Newco, the other parties thereto,
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Enforceability Limitations.

 

(c) The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters
are sufficient (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue
discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the
maximum amount of "flex" (including original

 



37

    

 issue discount "flex") provided under the Debt Commitment Letter) to enable
Newco to (i) consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated at the Closing upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) pay all of the Merger Consideration payable at the Closing in respect of
Shares in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) pay all amounts payable
in connection with the Closing in respect of the Option Consideration and the
RSU Consideration under this Agreement, (iv) pay all liabilities and other
obligations of the Company contemplated to be funded by Newco at the Closing
under by this Agreement, and (v) pay all related fees and expenses associated
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Commitment Letters incurred by Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates and required to be paid at
the Closing by such party.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the Financing Commitment
Letters have been amended or modified (and no such amendment or modification
is contemplated except (x) in connection with any amendments or modifications
to effectuate any "flex" terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
provided as of the date hereof, (y) to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and/or (z) as otherwise permitted
under _Section 7.3(a))_, and (ii) the respective commitments set forth in
the Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect (and no such withdrawal or rescission is contemplated) except to the
extent permitted under  _Section 7.3(a)_. Except as set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters, there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements to which Newco or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Newco under any
term or condition of the Financing Commitment Letters, or otherwise result in
any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters in the form so delivered to the Company. As of the date of
this Agreement, Newco has no reason to believe that any term or condition to
the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters will not be fully
satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to
Newco at the Closing, including any reason to believe that any of the
Financing Sources, or the Equity Financing Source will not perform their
respective funding obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters in
accordance with their respective terms and conditions.

 

(e) None of the Guarantor, the Equity Financing Source, Newco, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract with any
Person directly or indirectly prohibiting or seeking to prohibit such Person
from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

4.10 _Guaranty_. The Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in
accordance with its terms (subject to the Enforceability Limitations) and no
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guaranty.

4.11 _Non-Reliance_. Newco and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that, as of the date
hereof, Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives

and their respective Affiliates and Representatives, as of the date hereof,

Affiliates and Representatives) that, except for the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article III_ , (x) none of
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any other Person) makes, or has
made, any representation or warranty (whether express or implied) relating to
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses,
operations, properties, assets, liabilities or otherwise in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
as to the accuracy or completeness of any such information, and none of Newco,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives is
relying on any representation or warranty except for those representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in _Article III_ , (y) no Person
has been authorized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any
representation or warranty relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective businesses, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or
otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and if made, such representation or warranty has not
been and may not be relied upon by Newco, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives as having been authorized by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any other Person), and (z) any
forward-looking estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial information,
memorandum, presentation or any other forward-looking materials or information
provided or addressed to Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives (collectively, the " _Projections_ "), including
any materials or information made available in the electronic data room hosted
by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in connection with presentations by the Companys management, are
not and shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties
unless and to the extent any such materials or information is expressly the
subject of any express representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
_Article III_. Newco and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that it has conducted, to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the business, operations
and financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
each of Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates and Representatives

Affiliates and Representatives) that there are uncertainties inherent to all
Projections with which Newco and Merger Sub are familiar, that Newco and
Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of the Projections (including the assumptions
underlying the Projections) and that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives will have any liability to Newco, Merger Sub
or any other Person with respect to the Projections. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ serves to modify the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article III_ (as
modified by the Company Disclosure Letter) or the right of Newco and the
Merger Sub to rely thereupon.

ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 

7.1 _Company Stockholder Approval_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement and Other SEC Filings_.

 

(i) Promptly following the date of this Agreement (and in any event, no later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement), the Company
will prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended
or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Unless the Company Board has effectuated a Company
Board Recommendation Change in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, the
Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

(ii) If the Company determines that it is required to file any document other
than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant
to Applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " _Other
Required Company Filing_ "), then the Company shall promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall cause the
Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without providing Newco and
its counsel, to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon, which comments shall be considered by the Company in good
faith. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the stockholders of the
Company (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to any information supplied by Newco, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company
or its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other
Required Newco Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Newco
Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

 

(iii) If Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is/are
required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Merger or
the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to Applicable Law (an " _Other
Required Newco Filing_ "), then Newco and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other
Required Newco Filing with the SEC. Newco and Merger Sub shall cause, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Newco
Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC. Neither Newco or
Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates may file any Other Required
Newco Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC without providing the
Company and its counsel, to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon,

 



47

    

 which comments shall be considered by Newco, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates in good faith. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the
stockholders of the Company (if applicable) and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Newco Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Newco or Merger Sub with
respect to any information supplied by the Company or its Affiliates
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Newco
Filing. The information supplied by Newco, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy
Statement or such Other Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading.

(iv) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates, if
applicable, as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Newco Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the party that
discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to such filing describing such information will be
promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the appropriate party and, to the
extent required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

(v) The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in
writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing, as the case
may be, without providing the other, to the extent practicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written communication,
which comments shall be considered by the filing party in good faith.

 

(vi) The Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (A) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Newco Filing, as the case may be, (B) any receipt of
comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing, as the case may be, or (C)
any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith.

 



48

    

(vii) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the stockholders
of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that it will not review, or
that it has completed its review of, the Proxy Statement (which confirmation
will be deemed to occur if the SEC has not affirmatively notified the Company
prior to the end of the tenth (10th) calendar day after filing the preliminary
Proxy Statement that the SEC will or will not be reviewing the Proxy
Statement) (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ "); _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if the SEC Clearance Date occurs
prior to the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days) after the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period.

(b)  _Stockholder Meeting_.

(i) The Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law
(the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided that_ , without the prior
written consent of Newco and subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 7.1(b)(i)_, (x) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be held later
than the later of (1) forty-five (45) calendar days after the SEC Clearance
Date and (2) thirty-five (35) calendar days after the last day of the Go-Shop
Period and (y) the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Once established, the Company shall not change the
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written
consent of Newco (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) or as required by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders Meeting if (A) there are
holders of an insufficient Shares present or represented by proxy at the
Company Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (B) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting by Applicable Law, order or a request from the
SEC or its staff or (C) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting in order to give the stockholders of the Company
sufficient time to evaluate any material information or disclosure that the
Company has sent to the stockholders or otherwise made available by the
Company to the stockholders of the Company ( _provided_ that such
postponement or adjournment shall be for no more than ten (10) calendar days).

 

(ii) The Company shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and
unless the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to secure the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to
_Article VIII_ , the Company shall establish a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware
Law, whether or not the Company Board at any time subsequent to the date
hereof shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change or otherwise
shall determine that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends that
stockholders of the Company reject it.

Board shall (x) recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (y) include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and (B) neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (1) fail to make, withdraw, amend, modify or
qualify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner that is adverse to Newco,
or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner that is adverse to Newco, (2)

_Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or (y)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ to enter into a
definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Proposal, in each case at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the event that:

(A) the Company Board has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in violation of
_Section_ __ _ 6.1_, _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ _(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ or
in material violation of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_;

(B) The Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any public
announcement thereof shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change);

 

(C) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_, the Company Board shall
have given Newco at least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(ii)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(g)_ (the " _Change of Recommendation Notice Period_ ") (which notice

modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal;

 

(E) prior to the end of the Change of Recommendation Notice Period, Newco
shall not have made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner
that, if accepted by the Company, would form a binding contract, that the
Company Board determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and
its outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to stockholders of the
Company as such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material
revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in
price, shall require a new notice pursuant to clause (C) above, (y) the Change
of Recommendation Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to the
extent necessary to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remain in the
Change of Recommendation Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company

extensions of the Change of Recommendation Notice Period); and

(F) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Newco
pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ in order to enter into a
definitive agreement to consummate such Superior Proposal would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval in the event that the Company Board determines (after

Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; _provided_ that, prior to effecting a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iii)_, the
Company Board shall have given Newco at least four (4) Business Days notice
of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(iii)_ (which notice shall include the reason (in
reasonable detail) for such Company Board Recommendation Change) and, if
requested by Newco, the Company shall have met and negotiated in good faith
with Newco regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the Company Board no longer determines that the failure to
make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening
Event would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law.

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act or any other Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that
any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided, further_ , for avoidance of
doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for

Voting Agreement that are prohibited by such Voting Agreement.

7.2 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) _Filings and Cooperation_. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days, following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, each of Newco and the Company shall file with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) as

Company reasonably deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each party hereto shall
promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Authority in the U.S. or any Relevant
Jurisdictions regarding the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request
for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, then such party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.
Newco and the Company will consult and reasonably cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other in advance (to the extent legally permissible), any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals
made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with Legal
Proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws or foreign investment
review. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the

of all meetings with any Governmental Authority relating to any Antitrust
Laws, (ii) give each other reasonable opportunity to participate in each of
such meetings, and (iii) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all substantive written communications
(including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals) with a Governmental Authority regarding any Antitrust Laws. Any
disclosures or provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on
an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.

 



52

    

(b) _Remedies_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, if and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of
the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to
the Merger, each of Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable) and the Company and its Subsidiaries will (i) offer, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any
restrictions on the activities of Newco and Merger Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any
Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that, neither Newco
nor Merger Sub (nor their respective Affiliates, if applicable) or the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be required to sell, divest, license or otherwise
dispose of any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Newco or
Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand;  _provided, further_
, that neither Newco nor Merger Sub (nor their respective Affiliates) shall be
required to take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse impact on
the reasonably expected benefits to Newco or Merger Sub (or their respective
Affiliates) of completing the Merger.

7.3 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Newco and Merger Sub will not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Financing Commitment Letters if such amendment,
modification or waiver would, or could reasonably be expected to, (i)
reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of cash proceeds
available from the Debt Financing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter
(unless the Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent amount, Debt
Financing is otherwise made available to fund such reduction) or reduce (or
have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing
(unless the Debt Financing is increased by an equivalent amount), (ii) impose
new or additional conditions or other terms (except in connection with any
"flex" terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letter provided as of the date
hereof) to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to (A) delay, prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any
material respect, (iii) adversely impact the ability of Newco, Merger Sub or
the Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto or (iv) impose obligations on the Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date. In addition to the foregoing, Newco shall not
release or consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letter or of any
individual lender except for (x) assignments and replacements of an

set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_).

 

(b) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Newco shall, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates to, use its or their
reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and obtain the financing
contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any "flex" provisions) set forth in the Debt

applicable to Newco and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, and (v) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing, including by enforcing its rights thereunder and causing the
Debt Financing Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing at the
Closing. Newco and Merger Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and
when they become due. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
in the event that, notwithstanding Newcos use of its reasonable best efforts
to satisfy its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the "flex" provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
Newco shall promptly notify the Company thereof and use its reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Newco and Merger
Sub than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and in an amount at
least equal to the Debt Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, as the
case may be (the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "); _provided_ that in no event
shall any Alternate Debt Financing have the effects described in clauses (i)
through (iv) of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, and (ii) obtain one or more new
financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing
(the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt Commitment Letters
will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Newco
shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment
Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be redacted
with respect to fee amounts, pricing caps, original issue discount provisions,
"flex" provisions and other economic terms, so long as no redaction covers
terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing). In the event that any New Debt Commitment
Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing
Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include
the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by a New Debt
Commitment Letter at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letters
to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the debt financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing and/or any
New Debt Commitment Letter then in effect.

(c) _Equity Financing_. Newco shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take
all action and do, and shall cause its Affiliates to do, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity Financing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, including by (i)
maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) complying with its
obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter, satisfying on a timely basis
all conditions to funding that are applicable to Newco and Merger Sub in the
Equity Commitment Letter that are within their control, and (iii)
consummating the Equity Financing at the Closing, including by enforcing its
rights thereunder and causing the Equity Financing Sources to fund the
requisite Equity Financing at the Closing.

 



54

    

(d) _Information_. Newco shall (i) keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing, and (ii) provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive
agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Newco and Merger Sub shall promptly (but in any event no more than
thirty-six (36) hours following the occurrence thereof) notify the Company (A)
of any breach (or threatened breach) or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing, (B) of the
receipt by Newco or Merger Sub of any oral or written notice or communication
from the Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source with respect to
any (1) breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by
any party to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitment Letter
or such definitive agreements or (2) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to a Financing Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing, and (C) if for any reason Newco or Merger
Sub at any time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated
by the Financing Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing. Newco shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous
sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request
therefor to Newco. Newco shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause
the Equity Financing Source and the Debt Financing Sources to, provide the
Company and its Representatives with such reasonable access to Newco, the
Equity Financing Source and the Debt Financing Sources as the Company and its
Representatives may reasonably request for the purpose of allowing the
Company and its Representatives to understand the status of Newcos efforts to
arrange the Financing; _provided_ that Newco and its Representatives shall be
permitted to participate in any such discussions or communications.

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Newco and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

(f) _Company Support_.

 

(i) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts, will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
its respective reasonable best efforts and will use reasonable best efforts to

57

    

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)(i)_ or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (A) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement or is not
otherwise indemnified by or on behalf of Newco, (B) enter into or approve any

no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate,
agreement, arrangement, document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing
will be effective until the Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (including being
an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing) that is not
contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to
the Effective Time, and (2) any bank information memoranda required in
relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure and

as the obligor. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ will require (A) any
officer or Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver
any certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3(f)(i)_ or any other provision of this Agreement that could reasonably
be expected to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative,
or (B) the members of the Company Board as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time to approve any financing or Contracts related to the Debt
Financing.

 

(g) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of all logos of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such

information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing (or, for the avoidance of doubt, any Alternate Debt
Financing) and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents
in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) are informed of the
confidential nature of such information and agree to keep information of this
type confidential, or (ii) are subject to other confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of which the Company is a
beneficiary.

 



58

    

(i) _Company Reimbursement and Indemnification_.

 

(i) If the Closing fails to occur for any reason, upon request by the Company,
Newco shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) calendar days of

costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by the
Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with providing the

(ii) Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries,
and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other

any of them in connection with providing the support and cooperation
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives).

(j) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantor, the Equity
Financing Source, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
(which for this purpose will be deemed to include each direct investor in
Newco or Merger Sub and the financing sources or potential financing sources
of Newco, Merger Sub and such investors) enter into or enforce any Contract
prohibiting or seeking to prohibit, or that would reasonably be expected to
prohibit, any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or
equity financing for the Merger or any other transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from providing or seeking to provide debt
or equity financing to any Person in connection with any transaction relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

7.4 _Efforts to Close_.

(a)  _Reasonable Best Efforts_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
other covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ with respect to
Newco and Merger Sub, which sets forth Newcos and Merger Subs sole and
exclusive obligations in relation to the matters described therein ( _i.e._ ,
efforts required to obtain necessary antitrust clearances)) and  _Section_ __
_ 7.3_, each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do (or cause
to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties
hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.2_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain all necessary consents,

Relevant Jurisdictions, (iii) obtain all other necessary consents, waivers,
approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities and make
all registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Authorities, in
each case that are necessary to consummate the Merger and 

 



59

    

 (iv) to the extent reasonably requested by Newco, obtain all necessary or
appropriate consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to maintain and preserve the benefits
under such Contracts following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in Section 7.2(b), this Section 7.4 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, Newco and Merger Sub shall use their best efforts
to obtain all necessary approvals in the Relevant Jurisdiction on _Section_
__ _ 2.2(a)(ii)(B)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter ( _provided_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, that such efforts shall not require amending or
modifying any contractual arrangements with third parties existing as of the
date hereof).

(b) _Forbearance_. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (i) Newco or Merger Sub shall not (and shall
cause their Affiliates, including the Equity Financing Source, not to), and
(ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, in each case, take or fail
to take any action that is intended to or has (or would reasonably be
expected to have) the effect of (x) preventing the consummation of the Merger,
(y) subjecting the filing under the HSR Act to a "second request" by the FTC
or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or the other approvals set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)(ii)(B)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter to a "Phase
II" or substantially equivalent review by the applicable
Governmental Authority or (z) preventing, or delaying for more than ninety
(90) calendar days following the date hereof, receipt of all necessary
approvals in the Relevant Jurisdictions listed on _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)(ii)(B)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case, until the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)(ii)(A)_ has been satisfied.

 

(c) _No Consent Fee_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the payment of a
consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased or accelerated payments), or the provision of additional security
(including a guaranty), in connection with the Merger, including in connection
with obtaining any consent pursuant to any Material Contract.

 

7.5 _Access to the Company_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_
and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Newco and its Representatives
(i) reasonable access, during normal business hours and after reasonable
advance notice, to all assets, properties, books and records and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Newco may reasonably request; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict
or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent
that (a) any Applicable Law or the terms of any Contracts to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party prior to the date of this Agreement that
require the Company or its Subsidiaries to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information, or that give the other party the
right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to such Contract; (b)
access to such documents would be in violation of the HSR Act, Sherman Act,
or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition laws; (c) access to such
documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving
any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege
applicable to such documents or information; (d) access would

 



60

    

 result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of a third party or (e) such
documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal
Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco
and its Affiliates, on the other hand; _provided_ that, the Company shall (x)
to the extent legally permissible and in a manner that would preserve
privilege, provide Newco with a detailed description of such withheld or
restricted information and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to find a way
to allow disclosure of such information subject to the terms hereof, and (ii)
to the extent available and prepared in the ordinary course of business, for
the period beginning after the date of this Agreement and ending at the
Effective Time, as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar month
(other than at the end of a fiscal quarter), and in any event within
thirty (30) days thereafter, a copy of the monthly consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including statements of
financial condition, results of operations and statements of cash flow.
Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ will be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives to
prepare any reports, statements, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information (including monthly consolidated financial statements) not
otherwise prepared in the ordinary course of business. Any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_
will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk
of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply
to any information obtained by Newco or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_. All requests for access pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ must be directed to the General Counsel of the
Company, or another person designated in writing by the Company.

 

7.6 _Notice of Breach_.

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Newco in the event that any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, or in the event that the Company has failed to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or obligation to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case to the
extent such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would be reasonably likely to cause
any of the conditions to closing set forth in  _Sections 2.2(b)(i)_ or
_2.2(b)(ii)_ to fail to be, or unable to be, satisfied as of the Closing Date.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, Newco
shall promptly notify the Company in the event that any representation or
warranty made by Newco or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or in the event that Newco or Merger Sub
has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or
obligation to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in
each case to the extent such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would be
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to closing set forth in 
_Sections 2.2(c)(i)_ or _2.2(c)(ii)_ to fail to be, or unable to be, satisfied
as of the Closing Date.

 



61

    

7.7 _Confidentiality_. Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Thoma Bravo, LLC and the Company have previously executed an Amended and
Restated Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 14, 2018 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

7.8 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning this Agreement
and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Newco. Thereafter, the Company (unless the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has made a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one
hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties to this Agreement
before (a) participating in any media interviews, (b) engaging in any meetings
or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons, or
(c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to
become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the Merger, and
shall not engage in the foregoing without the prior consent of the other
party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that
the Company will not be obligated to obtain such consent with respect to
communications that are (i) required by Applicable Law or any stock exchange
rule or listing agreement, (ii) principally directed to employees, suppliers,
customers, partners or vendors and consistent with the communications plan
previously agreed by Newco and the Company, _provided, however,_ in each case
of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, only if
the Company has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with Newco and to
obtain Newcos consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such
communication is made, or (iii) related to or in connection with any disputes
between the Company, on the one hand, and Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor,
the Financing Sources, or their respective Affiliates, on the other hand,
relating to this Agreement.

 

7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
promptly notify Newco of all Legal Proceedings commenced or threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ")
(including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and
thereafter keep Newco reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
For the avoidance of doubt, Transaction Litigation shall in no event include
or be deemed to encompass any Legal Proceedings related to or in connection
with any disputes between the Company, on the one hand, and Newco, Merger Sub,
Guarantor, the Financing Sources or their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, relating to this Agreement. The Company shall (a) give Newco the
opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or prosecution of any
Transaction Litigation and (b) consult with Newco with respect to the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any Transaction Litigation. Further, the
Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, or
agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding, any
Transaction Litigation unless Newco has consented thereto in writing (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_, "participate" means that Newco will be
kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Newco may offer comments
or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such Transaction
Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.9_ shall limit the rights of Newco under _Section_ __ _
1.4(b)(iii)_.

 



62

    

7.10 _Section_ __ _ 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger and all other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and any other dispositions of equity
securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

7.11 _Directors and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Existing Agreements and Protections_. During the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
DGCL, their respective organizational documents and any and all
indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In
addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not
be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required
by Applicable Law.

(b) _Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or pertains
directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or
omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to, at or after the Effective Time), or (ii) any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Newco a written notice asserting a
claim for indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_, then the
claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time until such time as

 



63

    

 such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being
understood that, by electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving
Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the
Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect
thereto), (ii) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her
own counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii)
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an Indemnified Person promptly after statements therefor
are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv)
no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his
or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Newco)
shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

(c)  _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO
Insurance, on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are
equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance; _provided, however_ , that in
satisfying its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and
warrants to be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter); _provided, further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Insurance;
_provided_ the aggregate cost of such "tail" policy shall not exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such
a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (and Newco) under the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _
7.11(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

(d)  _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation (or Newco) shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation (or Newco) set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_.

 



64

    

(e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any
other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Persons or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights that such persons may have under the certificates of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or Applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations and liability of the
Surviving Corporation, Newco and their respective Subsidiaries under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall be joint and several.

(g) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 7.11_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Change of Control_. Newco hereby acknowledges that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) _Existing Agreements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding equity
based benefits, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)_ pursuant to
which the Contingent Option Consideration and Contingent RSU Consideration
will remain subject to their vesting and acceleration terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time), _provided, however,_ that nothing in
this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or
terminating any such Employee Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required by this Agreement or Applicable
Law.

 



65

    

(c) _Continuation of Company Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) employ the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of
employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain
for the benefit of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for
severance) and any other employee benefit plans or other compensation
(including base salary or wages, short-term incentive bonuses based on a
performance period of twelve (12) months or less and commissions, but not
including equity based compensation) and severance arrangements of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than equity-based
plans and individual employment agreements not providing for severance)
(together, the " _Company Plans_ ") at benefit levels that are no less than
those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this
Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee
under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide compensation and benefits (other
than equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing
for severance) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for
severance) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Comparable Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some combination of
(i) and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation
and benefits (other than equity based benefits and individual employment
agreements not providing for severance) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits (other than
equity based benefits and individual employment agreements not providing for
severance) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) provide each Continuing Employee who incurs a
termination of employment during the one (1)-year period immediately
following the Effective Time with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits to which such employee would have been
entitled with respect to such termination under the severance policies or
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and employment agreements
covering Continuing Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(d) _Service Credit; Etc_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable
Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee on or following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement, but not including
any defined benefit pension plan or similar arrangement or for any purpose
under any equity or equity-based plan); _provided, however_ , that such
service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication
of coverage or benefits or was not credited for the same purpose with respect
to such Continuing Employee under the analogous Employee Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible
to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit
plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company Plans) (such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to

 



66

    

 the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or
similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived for such
person under the analogous Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan,
and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan
which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of
such Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or
paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time, and shall not be subject to accrual
limits or other forfeitures that were not applicable as of the Effective Time.

 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this  _Section_ __ _ 7.12_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment or any term or condition of employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Newco, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any
Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to the limitations and
requirements specifically set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.12_, require
Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any
benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

(f) _2018 Bonus_. To the extent that a Continuing Employee is eligible to
receive an annual bonus for calendar year 2018 or quarterly bonus for the
fourth quarter of calendar year 2018 (" _2018 Bonuses_ "), payable in cash and
based on the Companys achievement of performance criteria, (i) the level of
achievement of the applicable performance metrics will be determined in good
faith by the Company Board or a committee thereof as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) provided that the Continuing Employee remains
employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay (and Newco shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay) such 2018 Bonuses.

 

(g) _Section_ __ _ 280G_. The Company and Newco or any Subsidiary of Newco
shall use their reasonable best efforts to mitigate and/or minimize the
impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of the Code (including as a
result of the Merger under all employment, severance and termination
agreements, other compensation arrangements and Employee Plans) on
any individual that is regarded as a "disqualified individual" (as such term
is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1). The Company
shall deliver a Section 280G analysis to Newco as soon as administratively
feasible following the date hereof.

 



67

    

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Newco shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Newco and Merger Sub will be jointly
and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

 

7.14 _Newco Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Newco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving
the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

 

7.15 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Shares
from NASDAQ and terminate registration under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that
such delisting and termination shall not be effective until or after the
Effective Time.

 

7.16 _Tax Rulings_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and/or accountants to prepare and
file with the ITA an application for a ruling (which shall be approved by
Newco prior to its submission and which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) confirming (i) that the cancellation and
conversion of the Company 102 Options, Company 102 RSUs and Company 102 Shares
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 1.4(c)(ii)_
or _Section_ __ _ 1.4(b)_, as applicable, shall not be regarded as a
violation of the "requisite holding period" (as such term is defined in
Section 102 of the Ordinance) so long as the applicable 102 Amounts are
deposited with the Section 102 Trustee until the end of the respective holding
period, (ii) that the deposit of the applicable 102 Amounts with the Payment
Agent and the Section 102 Trustee shall not be subject to any withholding
obligation and (iii) the tax treatment of the Contingent Option Consideration
and Contingent RSU Consideration paid with respect to Section 102 Options and
Section 102 RSUs (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions
regularly associated with such a ruling) (the " _Options Tax Ruling_ "). The
Company shall include in the request for the Options Tax Ruling a request
to exempt Newco, the Surviving Corporation, the Payment Agent and their
respective agents from any withholding obligation with respect to
consideration paid for Section 102 Securities. The initial request shall be
filed as a fast track ruling request for an interim approval confirming,
among other things, that Newco and any Person acting on its behalf (including
the Payment Agent and the Surviving Corporation) shall be exempt from Israeli
withholding Tax in relation to any payments made with respect to any Section
102 Securities to the Payment Agent, the Section 102 Trustee or the Company in
connection with the Merger (the " _Interim Option Tax Ruling_ "). To the
extent that prior to the Closing only the Interim Option Tax Ruling shall
have been obtained, then all references herein to the Option Tax Ruling shall
be deemed to refer to such Interim Option Tax Ruling, until such time that a
final definitive Option Tax Ruling is obtained.

 



68

    

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.2, each of the Company and
Newco shall cause their respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants
to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect
to the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of
any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Option Tax Ruling (including the Interim Option Tax Ruling). The
final text of the Interim Option Tax Ruling and the Option Tax Ruling shall be
subject to the prior written approval of Newco or its counsel, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company will
enable Newcos Representatives to participate in all meetings with the ITA
relating thereto. To the extent that Newcos Representatives elect not to
participate in any such meeting, the Companys Representatives shall provide
Newcos Representatives a report of the meetings held with the ITA. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to obtain the Interim Options Tax Ruling and the Options Tax
Ruling, as promptly as practicable.

__ _ 8.1(e)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_, or (B) pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(b)_ if, at the time of such termination, the Company would have been

(c) _Recovery_. Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree
that the covenants set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ are an integral
part of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements,
Newco, Merger Sub and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ or Newco fails to promptly pay any amounts due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Newco, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the

 



72

    

 amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ or any portion thereof or a
judgment against Newco for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ or
any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company will pay to Newco or Newco
will pay to the Company, as the case may be, its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs) in connection with
such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such
payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such
payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by Applicable Law.

 

(d) _Newco Expenses_. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
(i) _ Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, under circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)(i)_, or
(ii) _ Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, and as of such time of such termination by
Newco, Newco and Merger Sub were not in material breach of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement,
then within one (1) Business Day after demand by Newco, the Company shall pay
to Newco up to $4,000,000 of Newcos reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by Newco and
its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing)
(the " _Newco Expenses_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Newco;  _provided_ , that the
existence of circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to
become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(a)(i)_ shall not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Newco
Expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the payment by the Company of Newco Expenses pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 8.4(d)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to
pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)(i)_ except
to the extent indicated in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)(i)_.

 

(e) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting
from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company
Termination Fee or a Newco Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ are not a penalty but
rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Newco or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, the parties would not have entered
into this Agreement.

9.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Voting Agreements,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;
_provided, however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded,
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full
force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b)
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement is terminated in accordance
with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER NEWCO AND MERGER SUB, ON
THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE 

 



76

    

 OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR
THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

9.9  _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_, (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of
holders of Shares to receive the merger consideration set forth in _Article I_

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Debt Financing Source
shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages
or damages of a tortious nature.

9.10  _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

9.11 _Remedies_.

(a)  _Generally_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such

exercise of any other remedy.

(b) _Remedies of Newco and Merger Sub_. 

(i) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
injury would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the termination
fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, in the event of any breach of threatened breach by
the Company of any of its obligations hereunder, Newco and Merger Sub shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described
in  _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof,

 



77

    

 including the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger. The election to
pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit Newco from, in the alternative, seeking
to terminate the Agreement and collect the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ and/or the reimbursement of Newco Expenses pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall
Newco be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief or any other remedies under this Agreement or available at
law or equity following the payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(ii) _Company Termination Fee_. Newco shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.4(a)_.

 

(iii) _Expense Reimbursement_. Newco shall be entitled to reimbursement of
Newco Expenses if and when payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_.

(iv) _Termination_. Newco and Merger Sub shall be entitled to terminate this

future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates (other than Newco, Merger Sub or the
Guarantor), members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and
assignees of each of Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Equity Financing
Source and their respective Affiliates (the foregoing in clauses (A) and (B)
collectively, the " _Newco Related Parties_ ") have the right to seek or
obtain money damages from the Company or any Company Related Party under this
Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
other than the right of Newco and Merger Sub to payment of the Company
Termination Fee as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_ and/or the Newco
Expenses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(d)_.

 

(c) _Remedies of the Company_.

 

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants)_. The parties hereto hereby
agree that irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof
or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies
would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the
termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, in the event of any breach of
threatened breach by Newco or Merger Sub of any of their respective
obligations hereunder, and other than as it relates to the right to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger (which are
governed by the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(ii)_), the Company shall
be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Newco and Merger Sub in the courts
described in _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof.

 



78

    

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. The parties hereto hereby agree
that irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the
termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in connection
with enforcing Newcos obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
(and to exercise its third-party beneficiary rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter) and to consummate the Merger only in the event that each of
the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the conditions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time the
Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded, (B) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or the Debt Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that it will
be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (C) Newco and Merger Sub shall have failed
to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing was required by  _Section_
__ _ 2.1_ to occur and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing
to Newco that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it will take such actions that are required
of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to enforce specifically Newcos obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded (or exercise its third party beneficiary
rights under the Equity Commitment Letter) if the Debt Financing has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing). In no event shall the Company be entitled to specifically
enforce the terms of this Agreement other than solely under the specific
circumstances and as specifically set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(i)_ __
and this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(ii)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific performance or
other equitable remedies against any Debt Financing Source. The election to
pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative,
seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Newco Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_; _provided_ that in no event shall the
Company be permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief or any other remedy under this Agreement or available at law
or equity following the payment of the Newco Termination Fee in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(iii) _Newco Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of the
Newco Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_.

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

(v) _Monetary Damages_ _._ In no event shall (A) the Company,
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates or (B) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (foregoing in clauses (A)
and (B) collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") have the right to
seek or obtain money damages or

 



79

    

 expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) from Newco, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Equity Financing Source
or any other Newco Related Party other than (i) the right of the Company to
payment of the Newco Termination Fee as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_,
(ii) to enforce its rights under the Guaranty, (iii) the right of the Company
to reimbursement and indemnification as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(i)_
or (iv) the rights of the Indemnified Persons set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.11_ following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, payment
of the Newco Termination Fee by Newco or the Guarantor (if payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_) represents the maximum aggregate Liability of Newco,
Merger Sub, the Guarantor and any other Newco Related Party under this
Agreement and the transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby (other
than the amounts due under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(i)_). In addition, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby
(A) agrees that no Company Related Party shall have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) from any Debt Financing Source and (B)
waives any and all claims against the Debt Financing Sources (and agrees not
to bring any claim or cause of action) and hereby agrees that in no event
shall the Debt Financing Sources have any liability or obligation to the
Company or any Company Related Party relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_  that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(c)(v)_ shall
in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Newco, Merger Sub or
the Debt Financing Sources set forth under the Debt Commitment Letters. In
addition to the rights of Newco and Merger Sub hereunder, Newco and Merger Sub
shall be entitled, at Newco and Merger Subs sole election, to settle any
claims arising from or relating to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate
the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
courts described in _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ without proof of damages or
otherwise, and that such explicit rights of specific enforcement are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
such rights, none of the Company, Newco or Merger Sub would have entered into
this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief expressly
applicable under this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ on the basis that (i) it has an
adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or
enforcement, and each party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security. 

 



80

    

(e) _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ shall be the parties sole and
exclusive remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that such
party may have against the other party, the Newco Related Parties or the
Company Related Parties, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any
Applicable Law (including any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any
breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement.

9.12 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, Delaware Law, without giving effect to any choice of law or
conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any and all claims arising directly or indirectly
out of or concerning the Debt Financing (including any claim, controversy or
dispute against or involving any Debt Financing Source, including their
respective successors and permitted assigns, each of which is hereby
intended to be an express third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _
9.12_) shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with,
the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to any choice of law
