director and officer of the Purchased Subsidiaries, in their capacity as
such, identified in writing by Buyer to Seller at least 10 Business Days prior
to the Closing, or evidence of such persons removal from such positions;

 

(D) a certificate of an executive officer of Seller certifying to a true and
correct copy of the resolutions of Seller approving the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that such resolutions are in full force and
effect; and

(E) certificates for the Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers
duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto.

 

Section 2.03. _Pre-Closing Estimates_. No later than five Business Days prior
to the scheduled Closing Date, Seller shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting
forth Sellers good faith estimate of (i) the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment ("Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment"), (ii) Closing Net
Indebtedness ("Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness"), (iii) the amount of
Seller Transaction Expenses ("Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses") and (iv)
the Closing Purchase Price based thereon (in each case which estimates shall
be subject to the review and reasonable comments of Buyer, which Seller shall
consider in good faith), which Estimated Closing Statement shall be
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto and prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the accounting methods used in
_Exhibit A_ and its Supporting Documentation.

 



16 Section 2.04. _Purchase Price Adjustment Amount Calculation_. (a) As promptly
as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a statement (the "Closing
Statement"), along with supporting documentation in a form consistent with
the Supporting Documentation, setting forth Sellers calculation of (i)
Closing Working Capital, (ii) Closing Net Indebtedness, (iii) Seller
Transaction Expenses, and (iv) the Closing Purchase Price based thereon, which
Closing Statement shall be substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_
hereto and prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the
accounting methods used in _Exhibit A_ and its Supporting Documentation.

 

(b) If Buyer disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Closing Working
Capital Adjustment, Closing Net Indebtedness, Seller Transaction Expenses or
the Closing Purchase Price as set forth in the Closing Statement, Buyer may,
within 45 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a written
notice to Seller (a "Dispute Notice") disagreeing with such calculation and
which specifies Buyers calculation of such items and in reasonable detail
Buyers grounds for such disagreement. The Dispute Notice shall specify those
items or amounts as to which Buyer disagrees (each, a "Disputed Item"), and
Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Statement. If Buyer notifies Seller that Buyer agrees
with the Closing Statement within 45 days after receipt thereof or fails to
deliver a Dispute Notice within such 45 day period, the Closing Statement
delivered by Seller shall be conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and
the parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the first case, on
the date Seller receives the notice and, in the second case, on such 45th
day.

(c) If Buyer duly delivers a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller shall, during
the 30 days following such delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to
reach agreement on each Disputed Item in order to determine the Closing
Purchase Price. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during
such period, they shall promptly thereafter jointly retain a nationally
recognized accounting firm, who shall not have any material relationship with
Buyer or Seller (the "Accounting Referee") and cause such Accounting Referee
promptly to review this Agreement and the Disputed Items for the purpose of
calculating the Closing Purchase Price. In making such calculation, the
Accounting Referee shall consider only those Disputed Items as to which Buyer
and Seller have failed to reach agreement. Buyer and Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to complete
its work and render its determination within 30 days of its engagement. The
Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as
practicable, a written report setting forth such calculation. Such report
shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and
report shall be borne (i) by Seller if Seller is awarded less than 50% of
the sum of all Disputed Items submitted to the Accounting Referee, (ii) by
Buyer if Buyer is awarded less than 50% of the sum of all Disputed Items
submitted to the Accounting Referee and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer and
Seller.

 

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and Subsidiaries to, cooperate and assist in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing
Purchase Price and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section
2.04, including the making available to the extent necessary of books,
records, work papers and personnel.

(e) No fact or event, including any market or business development, occurring
on or after the Closing, and no change in GAAP or Applicable Law after the
date hereof, shall be taken into consideration in the calculations to be made
pursuant to Section 2.04.

 



17 Section 2.05. _Adjustment of Closing Purchase Price_. (a) If the Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyer shall pay to Seller, in the manner
provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount thereof. If the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller shall pay to Buyer, in the manner
provided in Section 2.05(b), the amount thereof. The "Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount" means an amount equal to (i) (x) Final Closing Working
Capital Adjustment _minus_ (y) Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment,
_minus_  (ii) (x) Final Closing Net Indebtedness _minus_ (y) Estimated
Closing Net Indebtedness, _minus_ (iii) (x) Final Seller Transaction Expenses
minus (y) Estimated Seller Transaction Expenses. "Final Closing Working
Capital", "Final Closing Net Indebtedness" and "Final Seller Transaction
Expenses" mean Closing Working Capital, Closing Net Indebtedness, and Seller
Transaction Expenses respectively, (x) as set forth in the Closing Statement
if Buyer does not duly deliver a timely Dispute Notice or (y) if a timely
Dispute Notice is delivered (A) as agreed between Seller and Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.04(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement, as determined by the
Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.04(c); _provided_ that in no event
shall Final Closing Working Capital, Final Closing Net Indebtedness or Final
Seller Transaction Expenses be higher than the highest value or lower than
the lowest value for such item claimed by either party in the Dispute Notice
or Closing Statement, as applicable.

(b) Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be made by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, at a mutually convenient time within five Business
Days after the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount pursuant
to Section 2.04, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account or accounts of such other party as may be designated by such other
party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05
shall bear interest on a daily basis, from and including the Closing Date, to
but excluding the date of payment, at a rate per annum equal to the rate of
interest publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank from time to time as its
prime rate in effect at its office located at 270 Park Avenue, New York,
New York in effect from time to time during the period from the date such
payment was required to be made hereunder, to the date of payment. Such
interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates
and shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual
number of days elapsed.

creation or imposition of any Lien on any Shares or asset of any Purchased
Subsidiary, except for any Permitted Liens, with such exceptions, in the case
of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as, individually or in the aggregate,

taken as a whole.

 

Section 3.05. _Ownership of Shares_. The authorized capital stock of the
Purchased Company consists of 100 Shares (of which 100 are outstanding as of
the date hereof). All of the Shares have been duly authorized, are validly
issued, fully paid and non assessable, and are owned of record and
beneficially by Seller, free and clear of any Lien other than Permitted Liens.
Seller will transfer and deliver (or cause to be transferred and delivered)
to Buyer, on the Closing Date, good and valid title to such Shares free and
clear of any Lien other than Permitted Liens. Except for this Agreement, there
are no binding agreements, arrangements, warrants, options, puts, rights or
other commitments, of any character or to which Seller is a party relating to
the issuance, sale, purchase, redemption, conversion, exchange, registration,
voting or transfer of any of the Shares.

Section 3.06. _Purchased Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Purchased Subsidiary is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all organizational powers and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits and approvals the absence of which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The authorized and issued and outstanding shares, membership interests or
other voting or equity interests of the Purchased Subsidiaries are set forth
in Section 3.06(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. Such issued and outstanding
shares, membership interests or other voting or equity interests of the

records that (i) is subject to the controls and procedures of Sellers
accounting systems and (ii) was prepared in accordance with the internal
accounting policies used by Seller, which are consistent with GAAP in all
material respects. The Financial Information presents fairly in all material
respects the information purported to be represented thereby as of the
relevant dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby, except that the
Financial Information gives effect to the Pre-Closing Transactions (other than
the divestiture of the Chicago and Grand Rapids facilities). As of the date of
delivery by Seller to Buyer and as of the Closing Date, the Required
Financial Information delivered to Buyer in accordance with Section 5.06 will
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis and
will fairly present in all material respects (except in the case of the
Interim Financial Information, subject to year-end adjustments) the financial
position of the Purchased Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results
of operations of the Purchased Subsidiaries for the periods involved, except

Registered Intellectual Property Rights that is material to the Business is,
to the knowledge of the Seller, valid, subsisting and enforceable and no such

connection with the Business in a manner sufficient to avoid abandonment or
cancellation of any such Trademark. The Purchased Subsidiaries have used
commercially reasonable efforts to police the quality of all products and
enforce adequate quality control measures to protect its rights in such
Trademarks material to the Business, if any, that it has licensed to others.

Buyer or any of its Affiliates) that otherwise have entered into or will enter
into

 



38  agreements in connection with the Debt Financing or debt or other financing
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, together
with their respective Affiliates, and their and any such Affiliates
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives involved in any
Debt Financing, or, if applicable, the Alternate Debt Financing, collectively,
the "Financing Sources") (such letters, together with all annexes, exhibits,
schedules and other attachments thereto, as may be amended or modified to the
extent permitted hereunder, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to
which the lenders (and certain of their Affiliates) party thereto have
committed, severally and not jointly, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and related fees
and expenses (the "Debt Financing"). As of the date hereof, none of the Debt
Financing Commitments has been amended or modified in any respect, no
provisions or rights therein have been waived, the respective commitments
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn,
terminated, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect, nor is any such
amendment, modification, withdrawal or rescission currently contemplated
except as expressly set forth therein with respect to reductions in the
amount of the commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitments with
proceeds from a public or private offering of equity or debt securities
consummated on or prior to the Closing (a "Securities Financing") (any such
reduction, a "Permitted Commitment Reduction"). Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (complete copies of which
have been provided to the Seller, with only fee, "securities demand," flex
and certain other economic terms redacted (as the same may be amended or
modified to the extent permitted hereunder, the "Redacted Fee Letter"),
provided that such redactions do not relate to any terms that would adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing), as of the date of this
Agreement there are no side letters or other contracts or understandings
related to the funding of the Debt Financing other than the Debt Financing
Commitments and Redacted Fee Letter delivered to the Buyer prior to the date
of this Agreement (other than any customary engagement letter that does not
impact the conditionality or amount of the Debt Financing). Buyer has fully
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Debt
Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and, as of the date hereof, the Debt Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties
thereto, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Seller set
forth in Article 3 in all material respects, no event has occurred that, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of
Buyer, any other party thereto under any of the Debt Financing Commitments. As
of the date hereof, Buyer is not aware of any fact, event or other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of Buyer under
any Debt Financing Commitment inaccurate in any respect taking into account
any materiality or other qualifications set forth therein. There are no
conditions precedent or contingencies directly or indirectly related to the
funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing (including any flex
provisions) other than the conditions precedent expressly set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitments. Assuming the commitments contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments are funded in accordance with their terms (after giving
effect to the flex

 



39  provisions and notwithstanding any Permitted Commitment Reductions), Buyer
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to (i) pay the Closing
Purchase Price, (ii) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Buyer in connection with the acquisition of the Shares and the Debt Financing,
and (iii) satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Buyer contemplated
hereunder.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of any financing transaction
shall not be a condition to the obligation of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 4.06. _Litigation._ There are no Actions pending against or, to the
knowledge of Buyer, threatened against, Buyer, except for such Actions as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is
a party.

Section 4.07. _Finders  Fees._ Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC and
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, whose fees and expenses
shall be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary which has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

 

Section 4.08. _Inspections; No Other Representations._ Buyer is an informed
and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in
the evaluation and purchase of property and assets such as the Purchased
Subsidiaries and the Shares as contemplated hereunder. Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that the Purchased Subsidiaries and the Shares are sold on an "as is
where is" basis and Buyer agrees to accept the Purchased Subsidiaries and the
Shares in the condition they are in on the Closing Date and without reliance
upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any nature
made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly set forth
in Article 3 of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty
with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or
made available to Buyer or its Representatives of future revenues, future
results of operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the Purchased Subsidiaries
or their future business and operations or (ii) except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement, any other information or documents made available to Buyer
or its Representatives with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries.

Section 4.09. _Purchase for Investment._ Buyer is purchasing the Shares for
investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
its investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of
such investment.

Section 4.10.  _Qualified Stock Purchase_. The transaction occurring pursuant
to Section 2.01 of this Agreement qualifies as a "qualified stock purchase"
within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code.

business for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000 or less having more

attributable to any Competing Business (so long as Seller uses its reasonable
best efforts to divest such Competing Business or a portion thereof (or,
at Sellers option, cease conducting the Competing Business or a portion

a Competing Business, and a Competing Business shall not include the
development, manufacture, sale, use or distribution, anywhere in the world, of
any product that is being manufactured or sold by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, but is not included in the Business. This

purchases assets, operations or a business from

 



44  Seller or one of its Subsidiaries, if such Person is not a Subsidiary or
Affiliate of Seller after such transaction is consummated. This Section 5.03
does not apply to any Subsidiary of Seller in which a Person who is not an
Affiliate of Seller holds equity interests and with respect to whom Seller or
another Subsidiary, as applicable, has contractual or legal obligations as of
the date of this Agreement (including fiduciary duties of representatives on
the board of directors or similar body of such Subsidiary) limiting Sellers
ability to impose on the subject Subsidiary a non-competition obligation such
as that in this Section 5.03.

 

 __Section 5.04. _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements._ On or prior to
Closing, Seller shall take any and all actions necessary to (a) terminate any
contract between a Purchased Subsidiary and Seller or any Retained Subsidiary
and (b) repay or otherwise settle any indebtedness for borrowed money owed by
a Purchased Subsidiary to Seller or any Retained Subsidiary. __

cause to be delivered) to the Buyer as promptly as practicable after the date

as of the date of determination, the "Audited Financial Statements").

 

(c) The Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Buyer as
promptly as practicable following the end of the fiscal quarter
ended November 29, 2015, an unaudited condensed combined balance sheet of the

45  For each subsequent fiscal quarter ended after November 29, 2015 (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the quarter ended May 29, 2016), in the
event the Marketing Period has not concluded on or prior to 60 days following
the end of the applicable quarter, the Seller shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to the Buyer as promptly as practicable following the end of the
applicable fiscal quarter unaudited condensed combined balance sheets and
related statement of operations, comprehensive income, business equity and
cash flows of the Purchased Subsidiaries, together with the corresponding

previously provided, in each case giving effect to the Pre-Closing

as practicable unaudited condensed combined statements of operations of the
Purchased Subsidiaries for the nine-month period ended February 22, 2015 and
February 23, 2014, in each case giving effect to the Pre-Closing Transactions.

 

(e) Seller will deliver or cause to be delivered within 20 days following the

purpose of the capital expenditures made by the Purchased Subsidiaries during
such preceding monthly period.

and representatives) conducted heretofore on behalf of Seller or the Purchased
Subsidiaries with respect to any Acquisition Transaction. None of Seller, the
Purchased Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents will directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, facilitate, or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
or disclosing non-public information) the making of any proposal with respect
to any Acquisition Transaction or negotiate or otherwise facilitate,

or understandings with Buyer with respect to a possible transaction involving
any portion of the Business or any of the Purchased Subsidiaries (including
any restrictions on such Persons with respect to potential financing sources).

 __Section 6.01. _Confidentiality._ All information provided or made
available to Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to any of the Transaction Documents or in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated thereby, whether provided prior to or after the date
hereof, shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate at the Closing with respect to
that portion of the Confidential Information (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) as relates to the Business and the Purchased
Subsidiaries and otherwise shall continue in full force and effect following
the Closing. If this Agreement is terminated, for any reason, prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms. However, Seller acknowledges and agrees that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the
Confidentiality Agreement (including Section 3 thereof which shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing Date), following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not be prohibited, directly or indirectly, from
entering into negotiations, agreements, arrangements or understandings with
any other Person with respect to a possible transaction involving the sale of
any portion of the Business or any of the Purchased Subsidiaries, and Buyer
may share any Confidential Information (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) with such other Person for that purpose; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall cause such other Persons to execute a confidentially or
similar agreement that provides substantially similar protections of Sellers
and the Purchased Subsidiaries confidential information as set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its controlled
Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, without
Sellers consent, disclose to any third party (other than each other and their
respective Representatives and the Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives) any of the terms or conditions of any of the Transaction
Documents (other than this Agreement (but excluding, for clarity, the exhibits
and schedules to the Agreement)); _provided_ that the foregoing restriction
shall not (a) apply to any information generally available to, or known by,
the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section
6.01) or (b) prohibit any disclosure (i) required by Applicable Law so long
as, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, Buyer provides Seller
with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity
(at Sellers sole expense) to contest such disclosure or to seek and obtain
confidential treatment with respect to all or any portion of such disclosure
or (ii) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy
relating to any of the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby. __

 __Section 7.01. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurance._ (a) Subject to

HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law, or if any Action is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document as violative of the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law, Buyer shall use its best efforts to promptly resolve such
objections. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause

49  hereby and (B) any request for, the entry of, and seek to have vacated or
terminated, any order that could restrain, prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including in the case of either (A)
or (B) by defending through litigation any action asserted by any Person in
any court or before any Governmental Authority, and vigorously pursuing all
available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal (and, in each case,
to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or
file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to
the Purchased Subsidiaries, by consenting to such action), as may be required
(x) by the applicable Governmental Authority in order to resolve such
objections as such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law or (y) by any domestic or
foreign court or other tribunal, in any Action challenging such transactions
as violative of the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law, in order
to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution, vacating, lifting,
altering or reversal of, any order that has the effect of restricting,
preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as soon as practicable and in any event prior to June 24,
2016.

__Section 7.02. _Certain Filings._ Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material
contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and (ii) in
taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers in a timely manner. To the extent permitted by
the relevant Governmental Authority and Applicable Law, Buyer and Seller shall
(a) allow each other (including their outside counsel) to attend and
participate in all meetings, discussions and other communications with all
Governmental Authorities in connection with the review of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; (b) promptly and fully inform each other of
any written or material oral communications received from or given to any
Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and provide them with copies of any such written communication; (c)
permit each other to review in advance, with reasonable time and opportunity
to comment, any proposed submission, correspondence or other communication to
any Governmental Authority; and (d) provide reasonable prior notice to and, to
the extent practicable, consult with each other in advance of any meeting,
material conference or material discussion with any Governmental Authority
relating to the transaction. Without limiting in any respect the parties
obligations contained in this Agreement, in the event that the parties
disagree with respect to strategy or tactics in connection with a Governmental
Authoritys review of the transaction, Buyers decision will control. __

 

 __Section 7.03. _Public Announcements._ The parties agree to obtain the
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of the other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party, but only following consultation with the
other party to the extent practicable, issue such public disclosure as may be
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange to which the disclosing party is subject. __

 



50 __Section 7.04. _Notices of Certain Events._ Each of Seller and Buyer
shall promptly notify the other party of: (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by any
Transaction Documents if the failure to obtain such consent would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any material notice
or other communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by any Transaction Documents; (iii) the
commencement of any Action that, if pending on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be disclosed pursuant to, in the case of Seller,
Section 3.11, or, in the case of Buyer, Section 4.06; or (iv) any fact or
occurrence which any such party obtains knowledge after the date hereof and
which if existing and known at the date of this Agreement would have been
required to be set forth or disclosed in or pursuant to this Agreement
and which would cause a condition to any partys obligations under this
Agreement not to be fully satisfied. Seller will, as soon as reasonably
practicable, advise Buyer of any knowledge of Seller of a breach
(notwithstanding any grace or cure period) of any Material Contract after the
date hereof which would reasonably be expected to result in the modification,
amendment, termination or cancellation of such Material Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sellers failure
to comply with this Section 7.04 shall not, in and of itself, (x) be taken
into account in determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 10.02
have been satisfied or (y) entitle any Buyer Indemnified Party to
indemnification, except to the extent such Buyer Indemnified Party was
actually prejudiced by such failure. __

 

Section 7.05. _Non-solicit; Non-hire._ (a) For a period of 18 months following
the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly solicit (or cause to be directly or indirectly
solicited) for employment any employee of Buyer or its Subsidiaries who is a
Transferred Employee as of immediately following the Closing (any such
employee, a "Covered Business Employee"); _provided_ that (i) the foregoing
restriction shall not apply to (A) generalized searches for employees through
media advertisements of general circulation, employment search firms, open
job fairs or other similar means which are not specifically targeted at such
Covered Business Employees or hiring any person that responds to the same or
(B) any Covered Business Employee whose employment is terminated by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary) and (ii) with
respect to any Covered Business Employee who voluntarily ceases employment
with Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary), the
foregoing restriction shall terminate upon the date that is six months
following the cessation of such Covered Business Employees employment with
Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Purchased Subsidiary).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not,
directly or indirectly, employ or engage in consulting or any other business
activity with any Key Employee for a period of twelve months following the
Closing Date.

 

(b) For a period of 18 months following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Purchased Subsidiaries) not to,
directly or indirectly solicit (or

 



51  cause to be directly or indirectly solicited) for employment any person who
is at the time of such solicitation or was within the six months preceding
such solicitation an employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than any Transferred Employee) with the title of "Director" (or any comparable
or senior title) and/or in a plant manager role and/or with whom Buyer had
contact or who (or whose performance) became known to Buyer in connection
with Buyers evaluation, negotiation or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ that (i) the foregoing restriction shall not
apply to (A) generalized searches for employees through media advertisements
of general circulation, employment search firms, open job fairs or other
similar means which are not specifically targeted at such persons or hiring
any person who responds to the same or (B) any such person whose employment
is terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates, (ii) with respect to any
such person who voluntarily ceases employment with Seller or its Affiliates,
the foregoing restrictions shall terminate upon the date that is six
months following the cessation of such persons employment with Seller or its
Affiliates and (iii) in the case of employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries
who provide services to Buyer pursuant to the Transition Services Agreements,
the foregoing restriction shall apply until the 18-month anniversary of the
last date on which the services of such employees are provided pursuant
thereto (provided that this clause (iii) shall not apply to any person whose
employment is terminated by Seller or any of its Affiliates other than for
cause).

__Section 7.06. _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion
of Attorney-Client Privilege._ (a) Buyer waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries) to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out
of or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the " __Post-Closing
Representation __"), of Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder,
officer, employee or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any
such Person, a " __Designated Person __") in any matter involving or relating
to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, by any legal counsel currently
representing Seller or any of its Affiliates, including any Purchased
Subsidiary, in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (the "
__Current Representation __"). __

__(b) Buyer waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) to
waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring
during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, and following the Closing, with any Purchased Subsidiary, it
being the intention of the parties hereto that all such rights to
such attorney-client privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege
shall be retained by Seller; _provided_ that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication not
involving this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to communications with any
Person other than the Designated Persons and their advisers. __

 



52 (c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) agrees that no communications (including
email or other written communications) subject to attorney-client privilege in
connection with the Current Representation shall be subject to disclosure,
directly or indirectly, to Buyer or any Person acting on behalf of Buyer, and
the Purchased Subsidiaries shall, without the necessity of further
documentation of transfer, be deemed to have irrevocably assigned and
transferred to Seller the attorney-client privilege and expectation of client
confidence with respect to all such communications, and all books and records
and other documents of the Purchased Company or the Purchased Subsidiaries
containing any such advice, communication or other materials, and the same
shall be controlled by Seller and shall not be claimed by, and no copies
shall be retained by, Buyer or any Purchased Subsidiary.

(d) Nothing in this Section is intended to or shall be deemed to operate as a
waiver of any applicable privilege or protection that could be asserted to
prevent disclosure of any confidential communication by any legal counsel
currently representing Seller or any of its Affiliates, including any
Purchased Subsidiary.

(e) Seller and Buyer agree to take, and to cause their respective Affiliates
to take, all steps reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this
Section 7.06.

Section 7.07. _Access to Information; Cooperation_. (a) From the date hereof
until the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement),
and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, Seller will
(i) give Buyer, its counsel and other authorized Representatives (including
the Financing Sources and any other potential financing sources) full access
to the properties, books and records of the Purchased Subsidiaries, (ii)
furnish to Buyer, its counsel and other authorized Representatives (including
the Financing Sources and any other potential financing sources) such
financial and operating data and other information relating to the Purchased
Subsidiaries as such Persons may reasonably request, (iii) instruct the
employees, independent accountants, counsel and financial advisors of Seller
to fully cooperate with Buyer in its investigation of the Purchased
Subsidiaries and (iv) no later than the Closing Date, provide to Buyer copies
of all material environmental compliance audits conducted since January 29,
2013 that are in the possession or under the control of the Seller and
relating to the Real Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer and its agents shall not (A) conduct or
cause to be conducted, without Sellers prior written consent, any invasive,
intrusive or destructive inspections or other sampling or testing of the
properties of the Purchased Subsidiaries, including of the air, soil, soil
gas, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other environmental
media thereon, (B) have access to any information to the extent relating to
any Retained Business or (C) have access to any Seller Tax Records.

(b) From the date hereof until the seven year anniversary of the Closing Date,
upon reasonable request, Buyer will afford promptly to Seller and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to its properties, books,
records, employees and auditors (i) to the extent requested to permit Seller
to prepare the Closing Statement, and (ii) to the extent requested to permit
Seller or any of its Affiliates to comply with their financial reporting,
accounting or

 



53  auditing obligations with respect to any period ending before the Closing
Date, (iii) in connection with any Action related to the conduct or ownership
of the Purchased Subsidiaries for which Seller or such Affiliate has retained
any liability under this Agreement and (iv) otherwise to the extent reasonably
required by Seller.

 

(c) Any access granted to either party or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 7.07 shall be (x) conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the party granting such
access and (y) subject to compliance by the Person receiving such access with
the Sellers facility entry policies and procedures. The party to whom
such access or other cooperation is granted pursuant to this Section 7.07
shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee
benefits (other than administrative overhead directly attributable to
requests for access made by or on behalf of Buyer (e.g., overtime)))
reasonably incurred by the other party or its Representatives in connection
therewith.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Section 7.07 shall require (A) Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to provide the
other party or its Representatives with access to (i) personnel records of
employees relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information which, in the disclosing partys good faith
opinion, is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject such party or
its Affiliates to risk of liability or violation of any data privacy laws or
(ii) information the disclosure of which, in the disclosing partys good
faith opinion (x) would conflict with confidentiality obligations to which
such party or any of its Affiliates is bound or (y) would reasonably be
expected to result in the forfeiture or waiver of any attorney-client
or similar privilege; _provided_ that, in the case of this clause (y), the
disclosing party shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the other party,
to the extent possible, with access to the relevant information in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to result in the forfeiture or waiver
of any such attorney-client or similar privilege, (B) either partys
independent accountants to make available to the other party or its
Representatives any work papers unless and until such Person has signed a
customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such access
to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such independent
accountants or (C) Seller to provide any cost or pricing information for any
of Sellers products that compete directly with Buyers products; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall provide any such competitively sensitive cost or
pricing information referred to in the foregoing clause (C) to Buyer pursuant
to the terms of that certain Clean Team Agreement, dated as of August 21,
2015, by and between Buyer and Seller.

 

Section 7.08. _Phase-out of Seller Retained Marks_. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing, but in any event, no later than 12 months
immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Purchased
Subsidiaries to, (i) cease all use of the Seller Retained Marks, (ii) deplete
the inventory, labeling, stationery, forms, supplies, displays, advertising
and promotional materials, manuals, and other materials existing as of Closing
that bear any Seller Retained Mark or remove, destroy or strike over all
Seller Retained Marks from the foregoing, (iii) remove all Seller Retained
Marks from all assets, websites, email and other online materials

 



54  and from all signage and other displays and (iv) no later than 10 days after
the Closing, file amendments to the Purchased Subsidiaries certificates of
incorporation, articles of association or other organizational documents with
the applicable Governmental Authorities changing the names of the Purchased
Subsidiaries to names that do not include any of the Seller Retained Marks (or
any variation or derivative thereof) or any other mark that is confusingly
similar thereto. Following the Closing, none of Buyer, its Affiliates or any
of the Purchased Subsidiaries shall contest the validity or ownership of any
of the Seller Retained Marks or adopt or employ any Seller Retained Mark (or
any variation or derivative thereof) or any other Trademark that is
confusingly similar thereto.

(b) Without limiting the rights and obligations set forth in Section 7.08(a),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller (on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates) hereby grants the Purchased Subsidiaries a
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free
right and license, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
12 months immediately after the Closing Date, to use the Specific Seller
Retained Marks but solely in connection with the distribution, marketing,
promotion and sale of the products of the Business existing as of the Closing
Date that utilize such Specific Seller Retained Marks as of the Closing Date.
The Purchased Subsidiaries shall use the Specific Seller Retained Marks solely
in the form stipulated by the Seller and its Affiliates and shall conform to
and observe such standards as the Seller and its Affiliates from time to time
prescribe, including standards relative to the (i) quality of products which
bear the Specific Seller Retained Marks, (ii) design and appearance of the
Specific Seller Retained Marks, and (iii) manner, disposition and use of the
Specific Seller Retained Marks provided that such form and standards shall not
vary in any material respect from the form and standards applicable to the
Specific Seller Retained Marks as of the Closing Date. The Seller shall have
the right, upon request by Seller, to inspect any product, material,
designation, document or other media bearing the Specific Seller Retained
Marks, including any marketing or promotional material. For the avoidance of
doubt, no inspection or Seller approval is necessary with respect to any
product, material, designation, document or other media bearing the Specific
Seller Retained Marks which existed, or is substantially similar to any such
item which existed, prior to the Closing. All goodwill associated with the use
of the Specific Seller Retained Marks by the Purchased Subsidiaries shall
inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of the Seller or its Affiliate, as
applicable.

Section 7.09. _Transition License to Specific Purchased Marks_. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer (on behalf of itself and its
Subsidiaries, including after the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) hereby
grants Seller and its Affiliates a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, royalty-free right and license, during the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending 12 months immediately after the
Closing Date, to use the Specific Purchased Marks but solely in connection
with the distribution, marketing, promotion and sale of the products of Seller
or its Affiliates existing as of the Closing Date that utilize such Specific
Purchased Marks as of the Closing Date. Seller and its Affiliates shall use
the Specific Purchased Marks solely in the form stipulated by the Purchased
Subsidiaries and shall conform to and observe such standards as the Purchased
Subsidiaries from time to time prescribe, including standards relative to the
(i) quality of products which bear the Specific

 



55  Purchased Marks, (ii) design and appearance of the Specific Purchased Marks,
and (iii) manner, disposition and use of the Specific Purchased Marks provided
that such form and standards shall not vary in any material respect from the
form and standards applicable to the Specific Purchased Marks as of the
Closing Date. The Purchased Subsidiaries shall have the right, upon request by
a Purchased Subsidiary, to inspect any product, material, designation,
document or other media bearing the Specific Purchased Marks, including any
marketing or promotional material. For the avoidance of doubt, no inspection
or Purchased Subsidiary approval is necessary with respect to any product,
material, designation, document or other media bearing the Specific Purchased
Marks which existed, or is substantially similar to any such item which
existed, prior to the Closing. All goodwill associated with the use of the
Specific Purchased Marks by the Seller or its Affiliates shall inure to the
sole and exclusive benefit of the Purchased Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

Section 7.10. _Insurance Coverage._ From and after the Closing, the Purchased
Subsidiaries shall cease to be insured by the Sellers insurance policies or
by any of its self-insurance programs and the Seller shall retain all rights
to control such insurance policies and self-insurance programs, including the
right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any of its insurance policies and self-insurance
programs. The parties acknowledge that the Purchased Subsidiaries and the
Business may be entitled to the benefit of coverage under the insurance
policies made available through Seller as described on Section 7.10(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the "Retained Policies"), and the Retained Subsidiaries
and the Retained Business may be entitled to the benefit of coverage under
the insurance policies made available through the Purchased Subsidiaries as
described on Section 7.10(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Purchased
Policies"), in each case with respect to acts, facts, circumstances or
omissions occurring prior to Closing ("Pre-Closing Occurrences"), and (a)
Buyer hereby authorizes Seller to report any and all Pre-Closing Occurrences
arising in connection with the Retained Subsidiaries or the Retained Business
to the applicable insurance providers to the extent permitted under the
Purchased Policies, and where not permitted, agrees to make such report on
Sellers behalf ("Purchased Policy Claims") and (b) Seller hereby authorizes
Buyer to report any and all Pre-Closing Occurrences arising in connection with
the Purchased Subsidiaries or the Business to the applicable insurance
providers to the extent permitted under the Retained Policies, and where not
permitted, agrees to make such report on Buyers behalf ("Retained Policy
Claims"). With respect to claims for Pre-Closing Occurrences made pursuant to
the preceding sentence, whether reported to the applicable insurance provider
by Sellers or by Buyer, each party shall, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the benefit of
the applicable insurance coverage and pay such benefit, if any, to Seller (in
respect of Purchased Policy Claims) or to Buyer (in respect of Retained Policy
Claims) (net of any Recovery Costs incurred by Buyer or by Seller,
respectively, as a result of the same); _provided_ that, (x) Seller shall
be fully liable for all uninsured or self-insured amounts in respect of any
Purchased Policy Claims and Buyer shall be fully liable for all uninsured or
self-insured amounts in respect of any Retained Policy Claims, and (y) Seller
(if in respect of Purchased Policy Claims) or Buyer (if in respect of
Retained Policy Claims) agrees to reimburse the other party promptly upon
request for all out-of-pocket and documented costs or expenses incurred by
such other party or any Affiliate of such 

 



56  other party in connection with making or pursuing any claim pursuant to this
Section 7.10, including the costs of filing a claim and any deductibles,
premium increases or other amounts that are or become payable by such other
party or any Affiliate of such other party under the applicable insurance
policies or self-insurance programs as a result of claims made pursuant to
this Section 7.10 (such costs and expenses referred to in this clause (y),
"Recovery Costs"). With respect to Pre-Closing Occurrences, Seller (with
respect to the Retained Policies) and Buyer (with respect to the Purchased
Policies) shall maintain the coverage in effect as of the Closing Date, or
substantially similar coverage, in full force and effect.

__Section 7.11. _Replacement of Guaranties._ On or prior to Closing, Seller
and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the replacement,
effective as of the Closing, of the letters of credit, guaranties, financial
assurances, surety bonds, performance bonds and other contractual
obligations entered into by or on behalf of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than solely by any Purchased Subsidiary) in connection with the
Purchased Subsidiaries, including those listed in Section 7.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that if any such letter of credit, guaranty,
financial assurance, surety bond, performance bond or other contractual
obligation is not replaced effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify
Seller and its Affiliates against, and hold each of them harmless from, any
and all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its Affiliates
related to or arising out of the same. __

 

Section 7.12. _Financing._ (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) described in the Debt
Financing Commitments and Buyer shall not agree to or permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Financing Commitments without the prior written consent of the
Seller, if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such reduction
constitutes a Permitted Commitment Reduction or (y) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent to
the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (i) delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) make the funding of the
Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitments or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, the ability of
Buyer to consummate the purchase of the Shares or the likelihood of
consummation of the purchase of the Shares ( _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitments (A) to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement,
in each case in accordance with the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date
hereof so long as the addition of such parties could not reasonably be
expected to have any of the effects described in clauses (i) through (iii)
above, (B) to correct typographical errors and (C) in accordance with the
"market flex" provisions thereof. Upon any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or modification of the Debt Financing Commitments in accordance
with this Section 7.12(a), the Buyer shall provide, within two days, an
executed copy 

 



57  thereof to the Seller and the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean
the Debt Financing Commitments as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified in accordance with this Section 7.12(a).

(b) The Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) subject to any
Permitted Commitment Reduction, maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitments until the Closing, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
and covenants applicable to Buyer in the Debt Financing Commitments and
otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments (provided that the Buyer shall not be obligated to negotiate and
enter into any definitive agreements with respect to any bridge financing to
the extent the Buyer reasonably believes that the commitments of the Financing
Sources with respect thereto will be reduced to zero (0) pursuant to a
Permitted Commitment Reduction on or prior to the Closing Date), (iv) upon
satisfaction of the conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitments,
consummate the Debt Financing at Closing, and (v) enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall give the Seller prompt notice (which shall in no event be more
than two Business Days from its knowledge thereof): (A) of any material breach
or material default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Debt Financing Commitment or
definitive document related to the Debt Financing; (B) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any: (1) breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt
Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing
or any provisions of any Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to any Debt Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing (but excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms
of the Debt Financing or any definitive agreement with respect thereto); and
(C) if Buyer will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related to the Debt
Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two
Business Days after the date the Seller delivers to Buyer a written request,
Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Seller
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of
the immediately preceding sentence; _provided_ that in no event will Buyer be
under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege if Buyer shall have used reasonable best efforts
to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. If
any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions contained in the Redacted Fee Letter
and excluding a Permitted Commitment Reduction) contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitments, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
and obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the acquisition of the Shares on terms not
materially less favorable from the standpoint of Buyer and the Seller than
those in the Debt Financing Commitments (taking into account the flex
provisions) as promptly as practicable

 



58  following the occurrence of such event but no later than the Business Day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (any such transaction or other
replacement of all or any portion of the Debt Financing, an "Alternate Debt
Financing"). Buyer shall promptly provide a correct and complete copy of each
Alternate Debt Financing commitment (together with a redacted copy of any
related fee letter) to the Seller. Nothing herein shall prohibit Buyer from
seeking to replace all or a portion of the Debt Financing or any Alternate
Debt Financing with proceeds from a Securities Financing.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use its best efforts to, and to
cause the Purchased Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective Representatives to, provide to Buyer, at the
Sellers sole expense, all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the arrangement and consummation of the Debt Financing
(including the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth therein),
any Alternate Debt Financing as set forth in Section 7.12(b), or any
Securities Financing, including (in each case, to the extent reasonably
requested):

 

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions (including accounting due diligence sessions),
drafting sessions and sessions between senior management and prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies;

 

(ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations (and assisting in the obtaining of corporate, credit and
facility ratings from ratings agencies), offering documents, private placement
memoranda, prospectus supplements, bank information memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, any Alternate
Debt Financing and any Securities Financing (including customary
authorization and management representation letters) and all documentation and
other information required in connection with applicable "know your customer"
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot
Act of 2001;

(iii) (A) assisting with the execution and delivery of any pledge and
security documents, currency or interest hedging arrangements, payoff and
release letters, lien terminations, other definitive financing documents, or
other certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer; (B)
assisting with obtaining consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Debt Financing and (C) cooperating to facilitate
the pledging of collateral (including delivery to the Buyer of (x) original
certificates evidencing all outstanding shares, membership interests or other
voting or equity interests (in each case, to the extent evidenced by a
certificate) of the Purchased Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date
and (y) any documents requested by Buyer in connection with the preparation
of intellectual property schedules);

(iv) furnishing Buyer and the Financing Sources, as applicable, as promptly
as practicable with the Required Financial Information;

 



59 (v) Seller shall provide as promptly as practicable such other pertinent
and customary financial and other information (including a managements
discussion and analysis of the Purchased Subsidiaries) relating to the
Purchased Subsidiaries as Buyer shall reasonably request in order to market,
syndicate and consummate the Debt Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing
or consummate any Securities Financing; it being understood that in no event
shall the information required to be delivered by the Seller pursuant to this
clause (iv) be deemed to include or shall the Seller otherwise be required to
provide (A) any description of the Securities Financing or the Debt Financing
or any Alternate Debt Financing, including any such description to be included
in liquidity and capital resources disclosure or any "description of notes,"
(B) risk factors relating to the Debt Financing, any Alternate Debt Financing
or any Securities Financing, (C) separate subsidiary financial statements or
any other information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule
3-16 of Regulation S-X or "segment reporting," (D) Compensation Disclosure and
Analysis required by Regulation S-K Item 402(b) or (E) any financial
statements other than the Required Financial Information;

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.12(c)(v), in
providing monthly income statements (excluding footnotes) of the Purchased
Subsidiaries promptly following the 15th day after the end of the relevant
monthly period; and

 

(vii) using reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining accountants
comfort letters, consents, surveys, legal opinions from local outside counsel
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer for financings similar to
the Debt Financing.

 

Nothing in this Section 7.12(c) shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Seller
or its Subsidiaries. Neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required pursuant to this Section 7.12(b) to enter into or perform under any
certificate, agreement, document or other instrument that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing
(other than the authorization letters and management representation letters
referred to in Section 7.12(c)(ii)) or, at Closing, effective with respect to
any entities other than the Purchased Subsidiaries. None of the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action pursuant to this
Section 7.12(c) that would subject it to actual or potential liability for
which it would not be indemnified hereunder or to bear any cost or expense or
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment (other
than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing, any Alternate
Debt Financing, any Securities Financing or any of the foregoing prior to the
Closing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing, any Alternate Debt Financing or any Securities Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this Section 7.12(c)) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (provided, however, that the
indemnification obligation set forth in this provision shall not prejudice

 



60  Buyers indemnification rights as provided in Section 11.02). Buyer shall,
promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Section 7.12(c). The Seller hereby consents to the use of logos
associated with the Business in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_
that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or
reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Debt Financing, or
any Alternate Debt Financing or any Securities Financing, is not a condition
to Closing and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing or any Alternate Debt Financing, subject to
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 10. In addition,
the completion of the issuance of the senior notes pursuant to the Debt
Financing Commitments is not a condition to Closing. In the event that all or
any portion of the Debt Financing to be obtained through the issuance of the
senior notes as contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments or any equity
or other Securities Financing, has not been obtained on or prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause, no later than
the Closing, the bridge facility to be drawn and the proceeds of the bridge
facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments to be used to replace
such portion of the senior notes and/or equity not issued at Closing.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement,

 

(i) the term "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive
Business Days throughout which (i) Buyer shall have all of the Required
Financial Information and such Required Financial Information is Compliant,
and (ii) the conditions set forth in Section 10.01 shall be satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing) and nothing has occurred and no condition exists
that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 10.02 to fail to
be satisfied, assuming that the Closing Date were to be scheduled for any
time during such 20 consecutive Business Day period; _provided_ that the
Marketing Period will not be deemed to commence if prior to the completion of
the Marketing Period, (1) the Sellers auditors shall have withdrawn their
audit opinion contained in the Required Financial Information or (2) the
financial statements included in the Required Financial Information that is
available to Buyer on the first day of any such 20 consecutive Business Day
period would be required to be updated in order to be Compliant in accordance
with Section 7.12(e)(ii) on any day during such 20 consecutive Business Day
period, in which case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence
until the receipt by Buyer of such Compliant updated financial statements;
_provided_ , further, that the Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date
that is the date on which all of the Debt Financing or any Alternate Debt
Financing as set forth in Section 7.12(b) is obtained;  _provided_ , further,
that if the Seller shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the
applicable Required Financial Information, it may deliver to Buyer written
notice to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery),
in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the

 



61  date specified in that notice unless Buyer in good faith reasonably believes
the Seller has not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information
and, within two Business Days after the delivery of such notice by the
Seller, delivers a written notice to the Seller to that effect (stating with
reasonable specificity which Required Financial Information Parent reasonably
believes the Seller has not delivered); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) under no circumstances shall the Marketing
Period commence prior to January 4, 2016; (b) in the event that Compliant
Required Financial Information is not delivered by Seller to Buyer on or
before January 15, 2016, then the Marketing Period shall not commence prior to
February 15, 2016, (c) in the event that Compliant Required Financial
Information is not delivered by Seller to Buyer on or before April 15, 2016,
then the Marketing Period shall not commence prior to May 15, 2016, and (d) in
the event that Compliant Required Financial Information is not delivered by
Seller to Buyer on or before July 15, 2016, then the Marketing Period shall
not commence prior to September 6, 2016;

(ii) the term "Compliant" shall mean, with respect to the Required Financial
Information, that

(A) such Required Financial Information, taken as a whole, does not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make such Required Financial Information not misleading;

 

(B) in the case of the Required Financial Information delivered in connection
with the offering of senior notes as part of the Debt Financing or any
Alternate Debt Financing), such Required Financial Information is, and remains
throughout the Marketing Period, compliant in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (excluding subsidiary financial statements or any other information
of the type required by Regulation S-X Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 or
"segment reporting"), except (x) for the absence of audited financial
statements for the full fiscal year ended May 26, 2013, but subject to
Sellers compliance with Section 5.06(a), and (y) that the Required Financial
Information, to the extent audited, has been audited only in accordance with
the generally accepted auditing standards of the AICPA;

(C) (1) the Sellers auditors have not objected to the use of their audit
opinions related to any audited financial statements included in such Required
Financial Information and (2) any interim quarterly financial statements
included in such Required Financial Information have been reviewed by the
Sellers independent auditors as provided in the procedures specified by the
AICPA in AU 722; and

(D) in the case of the Required Financial Information delivered in connection
with the offering of senior notes as part of the Debt Financing, the

 



62  Sellers auditors have confirmed that they are prepared to issue customary
(as contemplated by the AICPA in AU 634) comfort letters including negative
assurance (by delivering drafts thereof) when customarily required to be
delivered during the Marketing Period.

ARTICLE 8

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 8.01. _Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes._ (a) Seller shall, at its
sole cost and expense, (i) timely file or cause to be timely filed, when due
(taking into account any extension of a required filing date), all Tax Returns
with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries that are required to be filed on or
prior to the Closing Date or relate solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and
(ii) file or cause to be filed, when due (taking into account any extension of
a required filing date), all Tax Returns that relate to Combined Taxes (each
such Tax Return, a "Seller-Filed Tax Returns"). All Seller-Filed Tax Returns
that are described in clause (ii) above, but only to the extent they could
affect Taxes of the Purchased Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period,
and all Seller-Filed Tax Returns described in clause (i) above, shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and without a change of
any accounting method or other material election of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Any such Seller-
Filed Tax Return due after the Closing Date that requires the signature of
any Purchased Subsidiary shall be submitted to Buyer for Buyers review and
comment (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, supporting documentation) at least 15 Business Days prior
to the due date (including any applicable extension) of such return. Subject
to compliance with Section 8.01(c), Buyer shall cause the appropriate
Purchased Subsidiary to file all such Seller-Filed Tax Returns prepared by
Seller and timely delivered to Buyer in accordance with this Section 8.01.

(b) Buyer shall file, at its sole cost and expense, or cause to be filed,
when due (taking into account any extensions of a required filing date), all
Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Subsidiaries that are due after the
Closing Date and are not Seller-Filed Tax Returns (each a "Buyer-Filed Tax
Return"). Any Buyer-Filed Tax Return relating to a Straddle Tax Period shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and without a change of
any election or accounting method of the Purchased Subsidiaries, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law. Any Buyer-Filed Tax Return relating to a
Straddle Period that is an income Tax Return shall be submitted by Buyer to
Seller for Sellers review and comment (together with schedules, statements
and, to the extent reasonably requested by Seller, supporting documentation)
at least 15 Business Days prior to the due date (including any applicable
extension) of such return; _provided_ , _however_ , no failure or delay in
providing such Tax Returns shall reduce the obligations of the Seller for any
Taxes under this Agreement, except to the extent the Seller is actually
prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 

(c) If (i) Seller, within 5 Business Days after receipt of any Buyer-Filed Tax
Return from Buyer pursuant to Section 8.01(b), notifies Buyer in writing that
it objects to any items in such return or (ii) Buyer, within 5 Business Days
after receipt of any Seller-Filed Tax Return

 



63  from Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(a), notifies Seller in writing that it
objects to any items in such return, the disputed item shall be resolved in a
manner mutually agreeable to both parties within 5 Business Days, and if not
so resolved, then by a jointly retained Accounting Referee (which may be the
same as or different from the Accounting Referee retained pursuant to Section
2.04(c), if any) within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline
for filing such return; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any matter
that only relates to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and could not
reasonably be expected to affect the Taxes or Tax Returns of any
Purchased Subsidiary for a Post-Closing Tax Period, the Buyers sole basis
for objection with respect to such matter on a Seller-Filed Tax Return shall
be that such Tax Return has not been prepared in accordance with Applicable
Law. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be
adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the parties
without further adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such Accounting
Referee and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to a Buyer-Filed
Tax Return or a Seller-Filed Tax Return that is filed after the due date for
such return to the extent as resulting from compliance with this Section
8.01(c) shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Notwithstanding any
of the foregoing provisions, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant
to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
comparable provision of state, local or foreign law), (A) Buyer shall
not allow any Purchased Subsidiary to amend (1) a Seller-Filed Tax Return
without the prior written consent of the Seller, or (2) a Buyer-Filed Tax
Return if such amendment would result in the payment of any Covered Tax
without the prior written consent of the Seller, and (B) Seller shall not
file or amend any Seller-Filed Tax Return if such amendment would give rise to
any Tax payable by a Purchased Subsidiary or other Buyer Indemnified Party
that is not a Covered Tax without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

(d) Buyer shall, subject to the right to be indemnified for Covered Taxes,
timely pay or cause to be timely paid to the applicable Taxing Authority all
Taxes shown as due on any Buyer-Filed Tax Return filed under Section 8.01(b)
in accordance with Applicable Law and Seller shall timely pay or cause to be
timely paid all Taxes shown as due on any Seller-Filed Tax Return filed under
Section 8.01(b) in accordance with Applicable Law. Seller shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to any Covered Taxes shown as due and payable on any Buyer-
Filed Tax Return, by the later of (i) 10 Business Days after Buyer, after
having paid such Taxes, submits to Seller an invoice evidencing such payment
and (ii) 5 Business Days prior to the latest date on which such Taxes are due
and payable by Buyer without interest or penalties.

 

(e) Seller shall include the Purchased Subsidiaries in any Tax Return for
Combined Taxes, as applicable, through the close of business on the Closing
Date.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a Straddle Tax Period, (i)
the amount of any Taxes other than periodic Taxes as described below,
including sales, employment and income Taxes, of any Purchased Subsidiary for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (to the extent
reasonably practicable taking into account the Purchased Subsidiarys
accounting systems) and (ii) the amount of property Taxes and other similar
Taxes imposed on a periodic basis of any Purchased Subsidiary which relate
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to

 



64  be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the
Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Tax Period.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Transfer
Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes associated with the Pre-Closing Transactions
or the transfer contemplated by Section 5.07) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne half by Buyer and
half by Seller. Each of Buyer and Seller (as applicable) shall pay the other
party for its allocable portion of any such Transfer Taxes properly shown as
due and payable on any Tax Returns relating to such Transfer Taxes
prepared and filed by the other party within 10 Business Days after the party
filing such Tax Return, after having paid such Taxes, submits to the non-
filing party an invoice evidencing such payment. All Transfer Taxes with
respect to the Pre-Closing Transactions or the transfer contemplated by
Section 5.07 shall be paid by the Seller.

__Section 8.02. _Cooperation on Tax Matters._ (a) Subject to Section
8.02(b), Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each
other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries (including access to books
and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, for
determining and complying with any information reporting or withholding
requirements pursuant to Applicable Laws, the making of any election relating
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.
Buyer and Seller shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Taxes
pertaining to the Purchased Subsidiaries until the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations and abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority for all periods required by such Taxing
Authority, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other
party with at least 30 days prior written notice before destroying any such
books and records, during which period the party receiving the notice can
elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such books and records.
Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Purchased Subsidiaries. __

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent
solely relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries, Seller and its Affiliates
shall not be required at any time to provide to Buyer any right to access or
to review any Tax Return or Tax work papers of Seller, any Seller Group, or
any Affiliate of Seller (such Tax Returns or Tax work papers, the "Seller Tax
Records").

Section 8.03. _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. (a) From and after the Closing,
Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller the amount of any refunds (whether in the
form of cash or a direct credit against Taxes other than Covered Taxes)
received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the Purchased Subsidiaries in
respect of Covered Taxes (net of any Taxes imposed thereon (including any
income or withholding Taxes that would be imposed on the repatriation of the

 



65  refund to the Buyer) and any reasonable third-party out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Purchased Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund or credit),
except to the extent that such refund or credit (i) was taken into account in
the determination of Final Closing Working Capital; (ii) was produced by the
carryback of any Tax Asset generated in a Post-Closing Tax Period; (iii)
resulted from the payments of such Taxes made on or after Closing Date to the
extent the Seller (x) has not indemnified the Buyer or the applicable
Purchased Subsidiary for such Taxes, or (y) has otherwise borne the burden for
such Taxes through their inclusion in Final Closing Working Capital; or (iv)
gives rise to a payment obligation by Buyer or any Purchased Subsidiary to any
Person under Applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other
agreement entered (or assumed) by any Purchased Subsidiary on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer, at the sole cost and expense of Seller, shall take any
actions reasonably requested by Seller to seek any refunds.

 

(b) Within 30 days of filing a Tax Return of a Buyer (or any of its
Affiliates) (other than an estimated Tax Return) reflecting a Section 8.03(b)
Tax Benefit, Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of the Section 8.03(b) Tax
Benefit with respect to such Tax Return (net of any costs or expenses owed by
Seller that have not been previously paid); _provided_ that if the
Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit is in the form of an increased Tax refund, the
amount owed with respect to such Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit shall not be paid
by Buyer to Seller until 30 days after receiving the refund from the Taxing
Authority. A "Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit" means (without duplication) any
actual reduction in the aggregate United States federal or state income Taxes
paid by Buyer and its Affiliates for the taxable periods ending on or prior
to December 31, 2021 (determined on a with and without basis) to the extent
such reduction results from the (x) use in any Post-Closing Tax Period of a
Tax Asset or (y) a deduction in any Post-Closing Tax Period with respect to
Seller Transaction Expenses. If, subsequent to the payment by Buyer to Seller
of any Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit, there shall be (i) a final determination
by any Taxing Authority which results in a disallowance or a reduction of the
Tax Asset or the deduction for any Seller Transaction Expenses or (ii) any
other reduction in the amount of the Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit realized by
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (included the Purchased Subsidiaries), Seller
shall repay to Buyer the amount of any resulting reduction (such reduction
being computed consistently with the initial computation of the Section
8.03(b) Tax Benefit) in the Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit (and, to the extent
the reduction is attributable to an adjustment by any Taxing Authority, any
penalties or interest relating to such adjustment) within 30 days of the
reduction being payable to the applicable Taxing Authority (or the filing of
the Tax Return reflecting such reduced benefit). Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Purchased Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to claim
any Tax benefits that will give rise to a Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit;
_provided_ that, Buyer shall not be required to take any action that (i)
would result in Buyer or any of its Affiliates incurring a Tax that is not a
Covered Tax; (ii) would result in Buyer or any of its Affiliates incurring any
out-of-pocket expense that Seller is not paying (or reimbursing Buyer); (iii)
would extend the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment or collection of any Tax of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates that
is not a Covered Tax; (iv) would cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates to take
any position on any Tax Return that is not "more likely than not" to be
sustained if challenged by a Taxing Authority, provided that in the event that
Buyer and Seller disagree as to whether a position is "more likely than not"
to succeed, Sellers position shall prevail only if supported by an opinion
(in a form reasonably

 



66  acceptable to Buyer that permits the Buyer and any relevant Affiliate to
rely on the conclusions therein) of a nationally recognized law or accounting
firm chosen and paid for by Seller (and reasonably acceptable to Buyer); (v)
would require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to change (or preclude a change)
their corporate structure; or (vi) would cause Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to breach the terms of any contractual obligation. Seller shall pay all costs
and expenses of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with claiming (or
computing) any Section 8.03(b) Tax Benefit.

 

Section 8.04. _Covenants._ (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer covenants
that it shall not cause or permit any Purchased Subsidiary or any Affiliate
of Buyer (i) to take any action on the Closing Date, but after the Closing,
other than in the ordinary course of business or as contemplated by this
Agreement, including the distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of
any redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax
Asset of Seller or a Seller Group, (ii) to make any election under Section 338
of the Code or any comparable provision under Applicable Law with respect to
any Purchased Subsidiary in connection with the purchases under this
Agreement, (iii) to change any Tax election, make any Tax election
inconsistent with past practice, amend any Tax Return, take any Tax position
on any Tax Return, initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes or
agree to waive or extend any statute of limitations for the assessment or
collection of any Tax, or (iv) to take any action or fail to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to cause the transaction occurring pursuant
to Section 2.01 of this Agreement to fail to qualify as a "qualified stock
purchase" (within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code), in each case
without the prior written consent of the Seller, and in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), with respect to any matter that relates
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(b) Except as expressly required by this Agreement or with respect to any Pre-
Closing Transaction, Seller covenants that, (i) from the date hereof until
the Closing Date, it shall not (and shall not allow any Purchased Subsidiary
to) (A) change any Tax election of, or relating to, any Purchased Subsidiary
or change any other material practice or procedure of any of the Purchased
Subsidiaries relating to Taxes, (B) make any material Tax election with
respect to a Purchased Subsidiary inconsistent with past practice, (C) change
any method of accounting or accounting period used by any Purchased
Subsidiary for Tax purposes, (D) amend any material Tax Return of any
Purchased Subsidiary, (E) extend any statute of limitations for the assessment
or collection of any material Tax of any Purchased Subsidiary, (F) enter into
any material agreement with any Taxing Authority (including a "closing
agreement" under Code Section 7121) with respect to any Tax or Tax Returns of
any Purchased Subsidiary, or (G) surrender a right of any Purchased Subsidiary
to a material Tax refund; (ii) from the date hereof until the Closing Date,
it shall not (and shall not allow any Purchased Subsidiary to) take any action
outside of the ordinary course of business not contemplated by this Agreement
that could materially increase the Tax liability of any Purchased Subsidiary
or other Buyer Indemnified Party for a Post-Closing Tax Period (for the
avoidance of doubt, such actions shall not include the utilization by Seller
of any Tax Asset available to be utilized in the Pre-Closing Tax Period); and
(iii) it shall not (and shall not allow any Purchased Subsidiary to) make any
election, or take any action that results in a deemed election, under Section
336 of the Code or any comparable provision under Applicable Law with respect
to any Purchased Subsidiary in connection with

 



67  this Agreement. In the event that, by application of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-36(d), the inside basis of the Purchased Companys assets (the
"Inside Basis") would be required to be reduced by an amount in excess of
$501,288,582 (decreased by the excess, if any, of the Closing Purchase Price
calculated pursuant to Section 2.04 over $2,700,000,000 and increased by the
excess, if any, of $2,700,000,000 over the Closing Purchase Price calculated
pursuant to Section 2.04) (the "Basis Reduction Cap"), Seller shall timely
make the election described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)
such that the amount of the reduction in Inside Basis resulting from the
application of Treasury Regulations 1.1502-36(d) does not exceed the Basis
Reduction Cap. If the Seller is required to make the election pursuant to the
prior sentence, the Seller shall provide a draft of the election form to the
Buyer prior to the filing for Buyers reasonable review and comment.

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that the transfer of the assets to the Purchased
Subsidiaries pursuant to the Pre-Closing Transactions shall be a fully taxable
transaction and governed by Section 1001 of the Code. Within 180 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule setting forth the
value of the assets transferred to the Purchased Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Pre-Closing Transactions and allocating such value among such assets (the
"Allocation Schedule"). In the event Seller does not provide Buyer with
comments within 30 days from receipt of the Allocation Schedule, such
allocation shall be deemed final by the parties hereto. In the event that
Seller provides comments within such 30 day period, and the parties cannot
agree on a final allocation within 60 days after Buyer has delivered the
Allocation Schedule to Seller, then the parties hereto shall each prepare
their own allocation. Buyer and Seller shall report, act, and file all Tax
Returns and information reports consistently with the Allocation Schedule, to
the extent agreed to between the parties, and shall not take any position
during the course of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, to the extent agreed to between
the parties, unless required to do so by applicable law or a final
determination of an applicable Taxing Authority.

 

(d) Buyer shall enter into new gain recognition agreements with respect to
those existing gain recognition agreements set forth on Section 8.04(d) of
the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to Section 1.367(a)-8 of the Treasury
Regulations so as to render the exception set forth in Section
1.367(a)-8(k)(10) available with respect to any "triggering event" arising by
reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.05. _Tax Sharing._ Any and all existing Tax Sharing Agreements
between any Purchased Subsidiary and any member of a Seller Group shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date. After such date none of the Purchased
Subsidiaries, Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder.

Section 8.06. _Tax Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Closing, Seller
hereby indemnifies each Purchased Subsidiary and each other Buyer Indemnified
Party against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from (i) any Covered
Tax, (ii) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable expenses of
investigation and attorneys fees and expenses), arising out of or incident
to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Covered Tax,

 



68  including those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate
proceedings relating to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such
Covered Tax, and (iii) for all liability, costs, and expenses incurred in
connection with the filing of a Seller-Filed Tax Return (any item set forth in
clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of this Section 8.06(a) shall be a "Buyer Tax
Loss"). The amount of Buyer Tax Losses shall be computed applying the
provisions of Section 11.06(a) _mutatis mutandis_.

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its
Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation
and attorneys fees and expenses), arising out of or incident to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax, including those incurred in
the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax, (i) of any Purchased
Subsidiary other than Covered Taxes or (ii) resulting from any breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 (any item set forth
in clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 8.06(b), a "Seller Tax Loss"). The
amount of Seller Tax Losses shall be computed applying the provisions of
Section 11.06(a) _mutatis mutandis_.

(c) If the Seller is (or would be, assuming an adverse determination from the
relevant Taxing Authority) obligated to pay a Tax under this Section 8.06 that
is being contested or otherwise disputed with the applicable Taxing Authority
and there is a requirement (or there is a decision by the party controlling
the contest) to pay the Tax (or any portion thereof) (including as a deposit),
the Seller shall timely and properly pay such amount to the applicable Taxing
Authority on behalf of itself or the applicable taxpayer and to the
extent such amounts are subsequently recovered by a Purchased Subsidiary or
other Buyer Indemnified Party from the Taxing Authority, the Buyer shall pay
such amount to the Seller.

 

Section 8.07. _Tax Contests._ (a) From and after the Closing, if any Taxing
Authority issues to Buyer, any Purchased Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates (i) a written notice of its intent to investigate, audit or conduct
any proceeding that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for
any Covered Taxes or (ii) a written notice of deficiency for Covered Taxes,
Buyer shall notify Seller of its receipt of such communication from the Taxing
Authority within 10 Business Days of receipt. No failure or delay of Buyer in
the performance of the foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect
the obligations or liabilities of Seller pursuant to this Agreement, except
to the extent Seller is actually prejudiced by such failure or delay.

 

(b) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall control any investigation,
audit or other proceeding solely for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and not with
respect to any Straddle Period or portion thereof), including the Pending Tax
Matters; _provided_ , _however_ that (i) the Seller shall control such
investigation, audit or other proceeding in good faith; (ii) the Seller shall
keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding the status of such
investigation, audit or other proceeding; (iii) the Buyer shall have the right
to participate in such investigation, audit or other proceeding; and (iv) the
Seller shall not, without the Buyers prior written permission (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), settle, resolve, or
abandon such investigation, audit or other proceeding (or any portion thereof)
if such settlement, resolution, or abandonment could result in any Purchased
Subsidiary or other Buyer Indemnified Party incurring a Tax that will not be
fully paid by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



69 __(c) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall control all other
investigations, audits or other proceedings relating to Taxes or Tax Returns
of the Purchased Subsidiaries relating to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including
all Straddle Periods); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Buyer shall
control such investigation, audit or other proceeding in good faith; (ii) the
Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed regarding the status of such
investigation, audit or other proceeding; (iii) the Seller shall have the
right to participate in such investigation, audit or other proceeding; and
(iv) the Buyer shall not, without the Sellers prior written permission (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), settle, resolve,
or abandon (or allow any Purchased Subsidiary to settle, resolve, or abandon)
such investigation, audit or other proceeding (or any portion thereof) if such
settlement, resolution, or abandonment could result in a Covered Tax. __

 

 __(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 8.07 to the contrary, the
Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, exclusively control the conduct
of any investigation, audit or other proceeding related to Taxes or Tax
Returns of a Seller Group; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such
investigation, audit or other proceeding could reasonably be expected
to affect the Taxes or Tax Returns of any Purchased Subsidiary for a Post-
Closing Tax Period, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the
status of such investigation, audit or other proceeding. __

 

Section 8.08. _Survival_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the covenants and agreements to pay or indemnify for Taxes
contained in this Article 8 shall survive for the full period of all statutes
of limitations for the collection of the underlying Tax (giving effect to any
waiver, tolling, mitigation or extension thereof) plus 60 days and all other
covenants and agreements contained in this Article 8 shall survive until
performed.

shall cause one of its Affiliates to) make an offer of employment to such
Seller Business Employee on terms consistent with those applicable to
Transferred Employees generally under this Article 9, (b) Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate to cause such Seller Business Employee to become employed __

 



70  by Buyer or one of its Affiliates on, or as soon as reasonably practicable
following, the Closing Date and (c) from and after such Seller Business
Employees commencement of employment with Buyer and its Affiliates, such
Seller Business Employee shall be considered a Transferred Employee for all
purposes under this Agreement. Seller shall be solely responsible for all
severance and any other payments or benefits with respect to any Purchased
Subsidiary Employees or Seller Business Employees who terminate employment
prior to the Closing and/or who reject an offer of employment with the Buyer
or the Purchased Subsidiaries.

 

 __Section 9.02. _Seller Benefit Plans_. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 9.05, Seller shall be responsible for all liabilities related to any

the transactions contemplated hereby and effective as of the Closing, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Seller common stock and restricted
stock unit with respect to Seller common stock (together, " __Seller Equity

Date shall vest pro rata in an amount equal to (i) the total number of Seller
shares underlying the Seller Equity Award multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days elapsed from the grant date of the
Seller Equity Award through the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
equal to the total number of days between the grant date and the end of the
applicable vesting period of the Seller Equity Award, less (ii) the number of

valuation date immediately preceding such transfer.

__Section 9.05. _Certain US Plans_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take
all actions necessary to properly transfer the sponsorship of each of the
Benefit Plans set forth on Section 9.05 of the Disclosure Schedule (to the

with Applicable Law and the terms of such plan _provided that_ Seller shall
not transfer Liabilities and corresponding assets related to employees who
are not Business __

 



71 _ _ Employees or former employees of the Business. To the extent a Benefit
Plan set forth on Section 9.05 of the Disclosure Schedule or a Purchased
Subsidiary Benefit Plan benefits employees who are not Business Employees or
former employees of the Business, Seller shall retain assets and Liabilities
of such plans that relate to employees who are not Business Employees or
former employees of the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
sponsorship of any such Benefit Plan is not transferred to a Purchased
Subsidiary prior to the Closing, then effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
(or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) assume sponsorship of, and all
Liabilities and any assets relating to, such Benefit Plan to the extent such

applicable Purchased Subsidiary to, assume and comply with the terms of such
agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable
Purchased Subsidiary to execute amended collective bargaining agreements, new
participation agreements or other plan documentation associated with
Multiemployer Plans (provided that any such participation agreement or other
documentation, including any amended collective bargaining agreement, does not
give rise to Liabilities to the Purchased Subsidiaries in addition to those
currently in effect as of the date hereof and is not on terms that are less
favorable than those in effect as of the date hereof), subject to any changes
to such agreement as may be agreed upon between Buyer or the applicable
Purchased Subsidiary and the union, other labor organization or the individual
that is a party thereto. _ _

Transferred Employee shall cease participation in the health and welfare
benefit plans of Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries (each, a "Seller Welfare
Plan") and commence or continue participation in the health and
welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, after the Closing shall include the Purchased Subsidiary
Benefit Plans) in which each such Transferred Employee is eligible to

Subsidiaries shall be responsible for providing benefits in respect of claims

Date to the extent that such limitations were waived or met under the
applicable Seller Welfare Plan or health and welfare benefit plans of the
Purchased Subsidiaries; and

 

(b) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Transferred

warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Material
Adverse Effect (disregarding any qualification in the text of the relevant
representation or warranty as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect);

78 ARTICLE 11

 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

 __Section 11.01. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements._
The representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ that the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.16 and 3.25 (collectively, the " __Seller
Fundamental Representations __") and Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.07, 4.08 and 4.10
(collectively, the " __Buyer Fundamental Representations __") shall survive
the Closing indefinitely; and  _provided, further_ , that (A) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18 shall survive until
the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date; and (B) the Post-Closing Tax
Representations shall survive the full period of all statutes of limitations
for the collection of the underlying Tax plus 60 days (giving effect to any
waiver, tolling, mitigation or extension thereof) and the other
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.19 shall not survive
the Closing. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained in
this Agreement shall survive Closing indefinitely or for the shorter period
explicitly specified therein. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, any
breach or inaccuracy of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive
the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding two
sentences, if notice of the breach or inaccuracy thereof giving rise to such
right of indemnity shall have been given pursuant to Sections 11.03 or 11.04,
as applicable, to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to
such time. __

 

Section 11.02. _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the Closing,
Seller indemnifies Buyer, the Purchased Subsidiaries and each of their
respective Affiliates (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to
hold each of them harmless from any and all damages, dues, penalties, fines,
costs, liabilities, obligations, losses, expenses, and fees, including court
costs and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, but
excluding any Buyer Tax Losses (which, for the avoidance of doubt are covered
by Section 8.06) ("Damages") actually suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party
to the extent arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this agreement (other than a breach of the
Post-Closing Tax Representation, which shall be governed by Section 8.06)
(each such breach, a "Warranty Breach") by Seller; (ii) any breach of covenant
or agreement made or to be performed by Seller or, prior to the Closing, the
Purchased Subsidiaries, pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) any amounts of
Indebtedness of the Purchased Subsidiaries as of the Closing or Seller
Transaction Expenses, in each case solely to the extent such amounts are not
deducted for purposes of determining the payment of the Closing Purchase
Price at the Closing or taken into account in the calculation of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that with respect to indemnification by
Seller for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(a)(i), (A) Seller
shall not be liable in respect of any such misrepresentation or breach until
the aggregate amount of all Damages with respect to all such
misrepresentations and breaches exceeds $13,500,000 (the "Deductible"), and
then only to the extent of such excess, and (B) Sellers maximum liability for
all such misrepresentations and breaches shall not exceed $202,500,000 

 



79  (the "Cap"); _provided, further_ , that such limitations shall not apply to
any Warranty Breach related to the Seller Fundamental Representations or the
Post-Closing Tax Representations. Sellers maximum aggregate liability,
including with respect to the Seller Fundamental Representations, shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Sellers obligation for Taxes and other Buyer Tax Losses of the Purchased
Subsidiaries or other Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be governed by Section
8.06 and not this Section 11.02.

 

 __(b) Effective at and after the Closing, Buyer indemnifies Seller and its
Affiliates against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
Damages (but excluding Seller Tax Losses, which, for the avoidance of doubt
are covered by Section 8.06) incurred or suffered by Seller or any of its
Affiliates to the extent arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty made in this agreement by Buyer (other than the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10); (ii) any breach of
covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement (other than a covenant or agreement contained in Article 8,
which for the avoidance of doubt are covered by Section 8.06); or (iii) the
ownership or operation of the Purchased Subsidiaries after the Closing;
_provided_ that with respect to indemnification by Buyer for Warranty
Breaches pursuant to Section 11.02(b)(i) (other than with respect to the Buyer
Fundamental Representations), (A) Buyer shall not be liable in respect of any
such misrepresentation or breach until the aggregate amount of all Damages
with respect to all such misrepresentations and breaches exceeds the
Deductible, and then only to the extent of such excess, and (B) Buyers
maximum liability for all such misrepresentations and breaches shall not
exceed the Cap. Buyers maximum aggregate liability, including with respect to
Buyer Fundamental Representations, shall be limited to an amount equal to the
Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyers obligation for Taxes
and other Seller Tax Losses is governed by Section 8.06 and not this Section
11.02. __

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible and Cap shall not apply to
the Sellers obligation for Covered Taxes or other Buyer Tax Losses and no
such amounts shall be included in determining whether the Deductible or Cap
applies to other Damages.

 

Section 11.03. _Procedures._ (a) Each Person seeking indemnification under
this Article 11 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give prompt written notice to
the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of
the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by any third
party ("Third Party Claim"); _provided_ that the failure of the Indemnified
Party to give notice as provided in this Section 11.03(a) shall not relieve
any Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 11.02, except to the
extent that such failure actually prejudices the rights of any such
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all written
notices and documents (including any court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party
shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other information with
respect 

 



80  to any such Third Party Claim reasonably requested by the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole option and
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 11.03, to assume control of, and defend
against, negotiate, settle (subject to Section 11.03(b)) or otherwise deal
with such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party may nonetheless
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense. In the case of any Third Party Claim for which
indemnification is sought, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after receipt of the
notice of such claim (the " __Dispute Period __"), to assume control of and
defend against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party
Claim, or fails to provide the Indemnified Party with notice of its intent to
assume control of and defend against any Third Party Claim within the Dispute
Period, then the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle
(subject to Section 11.03(b)) or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim
pursuant to this Article 11, then the Indemnified Party may participate, at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_
that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such
defense with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i)
requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying Party, a material conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable; _provided, further_ that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, participation by the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnified Party to consult with independent counsel or advisors and to
submit comments and questions, which the Indemnifying Party shall consider or
respond to in good faith but the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
act upon and, subject to the terms of this Article 11, such comments or
questions shall not alter or limit the Indemnifying Partys obligations as
set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.03 to the contrary, neither
the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written
consent of the other party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for any
such settlement if (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are
paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (other than, for the avoidance of
doubt, the payment of the deductible referred to in clause (B) of the proviso
to Section 11.02(a)(iii) to the extent applicable), (ii) such settlement does
not permit any order, injunction or other equitable relief to be entered,
directly or indirectly, against the Indemnified Party and (iii)
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party
from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third Party
Claim and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party makes any payment on any Third Party Claim or in
respect of any Environmental Matter, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the
Indemnified Party to any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim or Environmental Matter, as
applicable.

 



81 (c) After any decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have
been consummated (in accordance with this Article 11), or the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the Indemnified
Party shall forward to the Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such
matter.

 

(d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.03 and the following
Section 11.04 shall not apply to indemnification for a Covered Tax or other
Buyer Tax Losses. The procedures for such indemnification shall be governed by
Article 8.

__Section 11.04. _Direct Claim Procedures._ (a) In the event an Indemnified
Party has a claim for indemnity under Section 11.02 against an Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees
to give prompt notice in writing, and as promptly as practicable, of such
claim to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall in no event be delivered
to the Indemnifying Party later than 60 days after the Indemnified Party first
learns of the facts on which such claim is based (such 60-day period, the "
__Notice Period __"). Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification and the amount of such Damages
incurred or that such Indemnified Party reasonably estimates in good faith is
likely to be incurred in connection with such claim (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party). The failure to notify
the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable within the Notice Period
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that such failure shall have actually prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party (in which case relieved only to the extent of such
prejudice), and in any event, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
indemnification obligation in respect of any claim for which notice is
delivered following expiration of the applicable Notice Period for such claim.
__

 

(b) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not
dispute its liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to any claim
other than a Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Dispute Period, the Damages arising from any such claim shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such Damages to the Indemnified Party on demand
following the final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, either
party may seek a resolution of such dispute by litigation in a court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 13.06.

 



82 __Section 11.05. _Environmental Matters._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 11 and without limiting the proviso in Section
11.02(a), with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder for any
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.18
(collectively, " __Environmental Matters __"), the parties agree on behalf of
themselves and their respective Affiliates that, in addition to the provisions
set forth in Article 11, (and in the case of any conflict between the
provisions of this Section 11.05 and any other provision in Article 11, the
provisions of this Section 11.05 shall prevail and apply): __

(a) Seller shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Damages (x)
arising out of or resulting from any testing, sampling or other invasive
investigation of soil, soil gas, groundwater, sediment or surface water
conducted on or after the Closing, unless such testing, sampling or
investigation performed by or on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties was:
(i) required by Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits, (ii) required by
any order issued under an Environmental Law or pursuant to a written request
by a Governmental Authority with authority under an Environmental Law to order
such action, provided such order or request was not solicited by or on behalf
of any Buyer Indemnified Party, (iii) reasonably determined by Buyer or its
Affiliates in good faith to be necessary in connection with any construction,
maintenance or repair activity at any Real Property where such construction,
maintenance or repair does or is reasonably expected to require access to, or
disturbance of, soil or groundwater and such construction, maintenance or
repair is performed for a bona fide business purpose, (iv) required with
respect to or reasonably necessary to defend or resolve any Third Party Claim,
(v) to the extent necessary in order for any Buyer Indemnified Party to
comply with the requirements of a lease agreement pertaining to a Leased Real
Property provided such lease agreement or requirements are in effect as of or
prior to the Closing, (vi) requested by a lender to Buyer Indemnified
Parties, provided such request was not solicited by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party, (vii) reasonably requested by a prospective buyer in
connection with the sale process for an Owned Real Property or the business,
provided such request was not solicited by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party; and (viii) to the extent necessary to respond to facts or
conditions that present a significant risk to human health or the
environment, and provided, in each case, that the limitations set forth in
this Section 11.05(a)(x) shall not apply to any sampling or testing of
drinking water, waste water, or indoor air, or to vapor intrusion testing to
the extent required by applicable Environmental Laws or Environmental
Permits, or (y) arising in connection with any change in use of Real Property
from industrial to a non-industrial use, on or after the Closing. For purposes
of clarity, the limitations for Damages set forth in this Section 11.05(a)
shall not apply to any Environmental Matters other than those relating to
Remedial Action.

(b) Any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party
(including as of the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) for any Remedial
Action shall be limited to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be
satisfied upon achievement of, in a reasonably cost-effective manner,
standards based on the industrial use of the relevant property as of the
Closing

 



83  Date, as such standards are set forth in applicable Environmental Laws as in
effect at the time such Remedial Action is addressed or by any order or
requirement of a Governmental Authority. Both parties expressly agree that
such standards may include risk-based clean-up remedies and standards and/or
the imposition of engineering or institutional controls such as deed or other
use restrictions provided such remedies, standards, controls, deeds or
restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with Buyers or the Purchased
Subsidiaries use and enjoyment of the Real Property in the manner it was used
as of the Closing. Any obligation of Seller to indemnify a Buyer
Indemnified Party (including as of the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries)
for any Environmental Matter that is not a Remedial Action shall be limited
to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be satisfied upon
achievement of, in a reasonably cost-effective manner, standards based on the
industrial use of the relevant property as of the Closing Date, as such
standards set forth in applicable Environmental Laws as in effect at the time
such Environmental Matter is addressed or by any order or requirement of a
Governmental Authority. At its sole cost and expense, Seller shall be
permitted to participate in the investigation, remediation or other resolution
of any Environmental Matter subject to indemnification under
Section 11.02(a)(i) which is being controlled by a Buyer Indemnified Party,
which participation by Seller shall allow Seller to consult with independent
environmental consultants or advisors and to submit comments and questions,
which such Buyer Indemnified Party shall consider or respond to in good faith
but Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to act upon and, subject to
the terms of this Article 11, such comments or questions shall not alter or
limit Sellers indemnification obligations as set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, Seller shall have no
liability under this Agreement for any Damages relating to any Environmental
Matters to the extent arising from the post-Closing change in any requirement
or obligation set forth in any Environmental Law or Permit required by
Environmental Law.

 

 __Section 11.06. _Calculation of Damages._ (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be (A) grossed up
for any Taxes payable on the receipt of the indemnity payment such that the
net amount received after the payment of all such Taxes equals the amount of
Damages and (B) net of any (i) amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit that has been
actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (in the form of
an increase in cash refunds received or as a reduction in Taxes otherwise due)
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages. If the Indemnified
Party (A) receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or
from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any Damages, then such
Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any
payment made or out-of-pocket expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses or Taxes incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount or (B) actually realizes or
receives any net Tax benefit in the year the Damages were incurred (or the
immediately succeeding year) that was not initially included in the
computation of Damages, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such net Tax benefit, net of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.
__

 



84 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for
any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that (A) such matter is
indicated on _Exhibit A_ hereto as being "assumed by THS" (the "Specified
Matters"); _provided_ , that such limitation shall only apply up to the
amounts specified thereon; or (B) the Indemnified Party had otherwise been
compensated for such matter pursuant to the calculation of Final Closing
Working Capital, Final Closing Net Indebtedness, Final Seller Transaction
Expenses or the adjustment of the Closing Purchase Price under Section 2.05 or
any other provisions of this Agreement, (ii) consequential, incidental,
special, exemplary, punitive or other similar Damages (other than to
the extent such Damages are finally awarded to be payable to a third party by
a court of competent jurisdiction), (iii) Damages for lost profits or
diminution in value or (iv) portion of the Reduction Fee.

 

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall mitigate in accordance with Applicable Law
any Damage for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Agreement, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any Damages to the extent arising from or aggravated by such Indemnified
Partys failure to mitigate or any other action taken or not taken by
such Indemnified Party. If such Indemnified Party mitigates its Damages after
the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party under any
indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that Damage, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the value of the benefit to the Indemnified
Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs of
mitigation) within five Business Days after the benefit is received.

(d) Each Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance coverage
for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

(e) Each party agrees that it shall not, and agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that its Affiliates do not, voluntarily or
by discretionary action, accelerate the timing, or increase the cost of, any
obligations of the other party under this Article 11\.

 

(f) Unless prohibited by Applicable Law, any indemnification payment made
pursuant to this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, including any payment
made pursuant to Article 8) shall be treated by Buyer and Seller as an
adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

Section 11.07. _Materiality_. For purposes of (i) determining whether any
representation or warranty has been breached or contains any inaccuracy and
(ii) calculating the amount of any Damages arising as a result of such breach
or inaccuracy, any references to "material", "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" in the representations and warranties shall be disregarded,
except, in each case for (x) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.07, Section 3.08, Section 3.09, Section 3.10(a), Section 3.13(b),
Section 3.17(a) and Section 3.20, (y) the use of the term "Material" in
"Material Contract" and "Material Adverse Effect" and (z) the use of the term
"material" in the definition of Permitted Lien.

 



85 Section 11.08. _Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates could have recovered
all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential Contributor")
based on the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the
Indemnified Party shall assign, or cause its Affiliates to assign, such of its
rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary
to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential Contributor
the amount of such payment.

__Section 11.09.  _Exclusivity of Remedies._ Except as specifically set
forth in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, Buyer waives and
releases, on behalf of itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties, any
rights and claims (whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, determined, determinable or otherwise) that
Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnified Party may now or hereafter have against
Seller, whether at law or in equity, relating to the Purchased Subsidiaries,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than in the case
of actual fraud. For the sake of clarity, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except as specifically set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer expressly waives and agrees to cause its Affiliates (including, as of
the Closing, the Purchased Subsidiaries) and other Buyer Indemnified Parties
and their respective successors and assigns, to waive any rights and claims
they may have against Seller and its Affiliates, including claims for
contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Law (whether now or hereinafter in effect), including the
Comprehensives Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C. § 9601, et seq., or to any Hazardous Substances, claims for breach of
contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation
and all other claims for breach of duty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 11.09 shall not prohibit either party from obtaining any injunctive
relief (including specific performance) if available pursuant to Section 13.09
with respect to any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. _ _

ARTICLE 12

 

TERMINATION

 

Section 12.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

(b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated
on or before August 1, 2016 (the "End Date"); _ provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 12.01(b) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has
caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time;

 



86 __(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if there shall be any Applicable Law (which
shall be final and not subject to further appeal) that makes consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise prohibited,
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
12.01(c) shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of
this Agreement has caused or resulted in such Applicable Law being enacted or
becoming applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby (including due to
a failure to use reasonable best efforts in connection with the actions
specified in Section 7.01 to the extent required thereunder); __

__(d) by Buyer if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.02(a) or 10.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; _provided_ that Buyer is not
then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.03 not to be satisfied; or __

 

 __(e) by Seller if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in
Section 10.03(a) or 10.03(b) not to be satisfied, and such conditions are
incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; _provided_ that Seller is not
then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set
forth in Sections 10.01 or 10.02 not to be satisfied. __

Other than in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 12.01(a), the

 __Section 12.02. _Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of

party to this Agreement; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement, the
provisions of this Section 12.02 and the provisions of Sections 6.01, 7.03,
11.09 and Article 13 shall survive any such termination; and _provided_ ,
_further_ that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party
hereto from any liability for (i) fraud and (ii) any willful and material
breach of, or failure to perform any obligation under, any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement. __

88 __Section 13.02. _Amendments and Waivers._ (a) Any provision of
this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party
to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the
waiver is to be effective, and in the case of an amendment of the definition
of "Financing Sources" in Section 4.05(a), this Section 13.02, Section 13.05,
Section 13.06, Section 13.07, Section 13.08 or Section 13.13(b) may not be
amended or modified without the written consent of the Financing Sources to
the extent such amendment or modifications would have an adverse effect on the
Financing Related Parties rights thereunder. __

 

(c) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 13.09, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

Section 13.03. _Expenses._ Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

 

 __Section 13.04. _Successors and Assigns._ The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that no party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer (by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise)
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of
the other party hereto, and any purported assignment, delegation or transfer
of rights or obligations under this Agreement in violation of this provision
shall be null and void _ab initio_. Notwithstanding the prior sentence,
Buyer may, without the consent of the other parties hereto (i) assign its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries, if such Subsidiary delivers to Seller an instrument in
writing that it is bound by and shall perform the obligations of Buyer under
this Agreement as if it were an original signatory hereto or (ii) assign its
rights or interests under this Agreement (in whole or in part) as collateral
to any financial or lending institution providing financing to Buyer;
_provided_ that, in each case, no such assignment shall release Buyer from any
of its obligations hereunder. In the event of an assignment contemplated by
this Section 13.04, any reference in this Agreement to "Buyer" shall be
deemed to include its Subsidiary transferee. __

Section 13.05. _Governing Law._  This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 13.06. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or any New York State court sitting in
New York City, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter
jurisdiction over such suit,

 



89  action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the
State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 13.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement,
each party agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any of the Financing Sources or any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, members, managers, general or limited partners, in their
capacity as such (together with the Financing Sources, the "Financing Related
Parties") in any way relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating to the Debt Financing Commitments, any Alternate Debt
Financing or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable law jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom).

 

 __Section 13.07. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST ANY FINANCING RELATED PARTY
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING, ANY DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT,
ANY ALTERNATE DEBT FINANCING OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. __

__Section 13.08.  _Counterparts; Effectiveness; No Third Party
Beneficiaries._ This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns, except, (a) with respect to Section 7.06, any legal counsel
representing Seller or any of its Affiliates, including any Purchased
Subsidiary, in connection with the Current Representation and (b) the
Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of Section
4.05(a) (with respect to the definition of "Financing Sources"), Section
13.02, Section 13.05, Section 13.06, Section 13.07, this Section 13.08 and
Section 13.13(b) and the Financing Sources shall be entitled to enforce such
provisions directly. __

 



90 __Section 13.09. _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby) were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, or
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof in any federal court located in the State of New York or, to the
extent that no such federal court has jurisdiction over such proceeding, in
any New York state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) any and
all defenses to any action for specific performance hereunder, including any
defense based on the claim that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b)
any requirement to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief. __

__Section 13.10. _Entire Agreement._ The Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. __

Section 13.11. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

__Section 13.12. _Disclosure Schedule._ The parties acknowledge and agree
that (i) matters reflected on the Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters required to be reflected therein, (ii) the inclusion of any
items or information in the Disclosure Schedule that are not required by this
Agreement to be so included is solely for the convenience of Buyer, (iii) the
disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that the matter is required
to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material,
(iv) if any section of the Disclosure Schedule lists an item or information in
such a way as to make its relevance to the disclosure required by or
provided in another section of the Disclosure Schedule or the statements
contained in any Section this Agreement reasonably apparent, the matter shall
be deemed to have been disclosed in or with respect to such other Section,
notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-reference to such other
Section or the omission of a reference in the particular representation and __

 



91 _ _ warranty to such section of the Disclosure Schedule, (v) except as
provided in clause (iv) above, headings have been inserted in the Disclosure
Schedule for convenience of reference only, (vi) the Disclosure Schedule is
qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this
Agreement and (vii) the Disclosure Schedule and the information and statements
contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as constituting, representations or warranties of Seller except as and to the
extent provided in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all references in the Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability of
agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party
rights, the absence or existence of breaches or defaults by Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries or third parties, or similar matters or statements, are intended
only to allocate rights and risks among the parties to the Agreement and are
not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any inference or
proof of accuracy or be admissible against any party by or in favor of any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement. __

Section 13.13. _No Recourse._ (a) Without limiting any other provision
of this Agreement, it is hereby agreed and acknowledged that this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any claims of action that may be based upon,
arise out of, or relate to, this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be made, against the parties hereto,
and no former, current or future Affiliates, officers, directors, managers,
employees, equityholders, managers, members, partners, agents, representatives
or assigns of Seller or Buyer, in each case who is not a party to this
Agreement shall have any liability for any obligations of the parties hereto
or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
parties hereto expressly agrees that (i) none of the Financing Related
Parties will have any liability or obligation to the Seller, the Purchased
Company or any of their respective stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing, any Debt Financing Commitment or any
Alternate Debt Financing commitment, or for any claim for any liability,
settlement, damages, costs, expenses, fines, penalties or loss suffered in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder,
including as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any
Debt Financing Commitment or any Alternate Debt Financing commitment
(including any willful breach thereof), or the failure of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby to be consummated, or in respect of any oral or
written representation made or alleged to have been made, in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, and (ii) none of the Seller, the Purchased Company or any of
their respective stockholders, Representatives or Affiliates will have any
direct rights or claims against any of the Financing Related Parties under or
in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any Debt Financing
Commitment or any Alternate Debt Financing commitment or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
tort or otherwise and the Seller and the Purchased Company hereby waive all
such rights and claims on behalf of themselves and on behalf of their
respective controlled Affiliates. None of the Seller, the Purchased Company or
any of their respective controlled Affiliates will commence any action or

 



92  proceeding against any Financing Related Party relating to or in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any Debt Financing Commitment, any
Alternate Debt Financing commitment or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby and no Representative of the Seller or any Purchased Subsidiary (in
their capacities as Representatives) will do so with the Sellers or Purchased
Companys support or on its behalf; and the Seller and the Purchased Company
will cooperate with the Buyer or Financing Sources in seeking to dismiss such
suit commenced by Sellers or the Purchased Companys Representatives in their
capacities as such. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of
the parties hereto expressly agrees that in no event shall the Seller, the
Purchased Company or any of their respective Representatives or controlled
Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of any Debt
Financing Commitment or any Alternate Debt Financing commitment against the
Financing Sources; _ provided_, that nothing herein to the contrary shall
prohibit (i) the Buyer from enforcing its rights directly against
the Financing Sources under any Debt Financing Commitment or any Alternate
Debt Financing commitment or causing the Financing Sources to fund pursuant to
any Debt Financing Commitment or any Alternate Debt Financing commitment (and
nothing herein shall alter the Buyers obligations otherwise set forth in
this Agreement with respect to enforcing the Debt Commitment or any Alternate
Debt Financing) and (ii) the Seller or the Purchased Company from seeking
specific performance pursuant to Section 13.09 to cause the Buyer to
consummate the purchase of the Shares and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.
