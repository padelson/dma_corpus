subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental approvals. Each employee of RBMG at the Effective Time who becomes an employee of NetBank or a NetBank Subsidiary ("Employer

provided to the Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Successor Plans"). Until such time as the Successor Plans are adopted and made available to the Transferred
Employees (which may occur at different times with respect to different employees, plans and programs) NetBank (or the applicable Employer Entity) shall cause each RBMG Plan set forth on </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Schedule&nbsp;6.7(b)</I></FONT><FONT

plans shall have an eligibility waiting period applicable to any Transferred Employee which would exceed the eligibility waiting period applicable to such employees as of the Effective Time under the
corresponding RBMG Plan applicable to such employee as in effect on the Effective Time. If the first plan year of participation in any group health plan of an Employer Entity by a Transferred Employee
is a partial year, the Employer Entity will give such Transferred Employee and his or her dependents credit toward deductible and out-of-pocket limitations for and eligible
expenses incurred by such persons under the RBMG group health plan during that portion of that plan year that precedes entry into the group health plan(s) of the Employer Entity. With respect to each
NetBank Plan, or an Employer Entity in which a Transferred Employee participates for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, including for severance
benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension on benefits), service with RBMG (or predecessor employers to the extent RBMG provides past service credit) shall be treated as service
