                           the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, its sole
                           shareholder; and


                                       1

         (f)               The Board of Directors of Parent has approved the
                           transactions contemplated hereby as sole shareholder
                           of Merger Sub; and

         (g)               Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
                           Agreement, Parent is entering into a Registration
                           Rights Agreement with certain stockholders of the
                           Company in the form of Exhibit "B" hereto (the
                           "Registration Rights Agreement").

         (h)               The parties hereto desire, if possible, that the
                           Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section
                           368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
                           amended (the "Code"), and the regulations promulgated
                           thereto, and that this Agreement shall be, and is
                           hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization for
                           purposes of Section 368 of the Code (subject to the
                           election provided in Section 1.1).

AGREEMENT:

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time (as hereinafter defined), the Company shall be merged with and into Merger
Sub, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, and
Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. In accordance with Section
259 of the DGCL, all of the rights, privileges, powers, immunities, purposes and
franchises of Merger Sub and the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation
and all of the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of Merger Sub and the
Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the
Surviving Corporation. In lieu of the Company being merged with and into Merger
Sub, if all of the conditions set forth in Article VII (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date (as hereinafter
defined)) have been satisfied or waived, and if either (i) the Tax Opinion (as
hereinafter defined) cannot be, or is not, delivered, or (ii) Parent reasonably
determines in good faith that the combination of (a) the number of Company
Stockholders exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL,
(b) the trading price of Parent Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (c) the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, and (d) the amount of
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, could result in



                                       2
<PAGE>   14

the cash payable to or for the benefit of the Company Stockholders as a result
of the Merger exceeding 60% of the total fair market value of the cash and
Parent Common Stock payable and deliverable to the Company Stockholders as a
result of the Merger, then, in either case, Parent shall have the right at any
time prior to the Effective Time to irrevocably elect (the "Reverse Merger
Election") by notice delivered to the Company, and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to cause the "Merger" to be a merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company at the Effective Time, in which case,
following the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. If the Reverse
Merger Election is made, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Merger shall
not, and shall not be intended to, qualify as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.

         Section 1.2 CLOSING. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., 1325
Avenue of the Americas, 17th Floor, New York, New York 10019-6026 , at 10:00
a.m., local time, on the second business day after the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.1(a), (c) and (d) have been satisfied or on such other date and at
such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree (the date on
which the Closing actually occurs being referred to herein as the "Closing
Date").

         Section 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective at the
time of filing of, or at such later time specified in, a properly executed
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), in the form required by and
executed in accordance with the DGCL, filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in accordance with the provisions of Section 251 of the DGCL.
Such filing shall be made contemporaneously with, or immediately after, the
Closing. When used in this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the
date and time at which the Merger shall become effective.

         Section 1.4 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. Unless the Reverse Merger
Election is made, from and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with Applicable Law (as hereinafter defined);
provided, however, that Article I of such Certificate of Incorporation shall be
amended to read in its entirety as follows: "The name of this Corporation is
"International Home Foods, Inc." If the Reverse Merger Election is made, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by Applicable Law.

         Section 1.5 BY-LAWS. From and after the Effective Time, the By-Laws of
Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
Applicable Law, provided that if the Reverse Merger Election is made, the
By-Laws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

         Section 1.6 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. From and after the Effective Time,
the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
the directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the
Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law. The
officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall become the officers of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation or as otherwise provided by law.

                                   ARTICLE II

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

         Section 2.1 CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock (as defined herein) or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

         (a) Each share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock" or "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) hereof and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.6)) shall
be converted into the right to receive (i) that number of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share, of
Parent ("Parent Common Stock"), determined by dividing $11.00 by the "Average
Trading Price" (the "Per Share Stock Consideration"), which quotient shall be
rounded to the nearest fifth decimal place and (ii) $11.00 in cash (the "Per
Share Cash Consideration"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Average Trading
Price" shall mean the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE
Composite Transactions List (as reprinted by The Wall Street Journal) for the
ten (10) full trading days ending on the fifth (5th) full trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, provided, however, in no event shall the
Average Trading Price (x) be greater than $22.00; nor (y) be less than $18.00.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Merger Consideration" shall mean the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration to which holders of
shares of Company Common Stock are entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(a).

         (b) Each share of common stock, par value $.01, of Merger Sub ("Merger
Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one duly issued, validly authorized, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

         (c) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.



                                       4
<PAGE>   16

         (d) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall
cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.1(c) and 2.6, each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the
right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled all in accordance with this
Agreement upon the surrender of such Certificate.

         (e) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Parent shall split, combine or otherwise reclassify the Parent Common Stock, or
pay a stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock, or
otherwise change the Parent Common Stock into other securities, or make any
other such stock dividend or distribution in capital stock of Parent in respect
of the Parent Common Stock (collectively a "Stock Action"), the Average Trading
Price and the maximum and minimum limits on the adjustment of the Average
Trading Price set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of Section 2.1(a), each shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such Stock Action, upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.2
hereof.

         Section 2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.

         (a) Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as Exchange
Agent hereunder (the "Exchange Agent"). Immediately following the Effective
Time, but no later than the next business day, Parent shall deliver, in trust,
to the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, (i) cash in an
amount necessary to make any cash payment due under Sections 2.1(a) and 2.4
hereof, and (ii) certificates evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding Shares. The cash
and the certificates evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to
the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) and comprising the Merger
Consideration shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund". The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund in one or
more bank accounts or in high-quality, short-term investments, as directed by
Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid to Parent.

         (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
more than five business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of Certificates (i) a form of letter of
transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) that



                                       5
<PAGE>   17

number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the Per Share
Stock Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares formerly represented by
the surrendered Certificate; provided, however, that each holder shall receive
cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof, (B) any amounts to
which the holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof after giving effect
to any required tax withholdings, and (C) payment by check of an amount equal to
the product of the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of
Shares formerly represented by the surrendered Certificate, after giving effect
to any required tax withholding, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. In no event shall the holder of any such surrendered Certificate
be entitled to receive interest on any cash to be received in the Merger.

         (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

         (d) At the Closing and immediately after the Effective Time, any
Company Rule 145 Affiliate, and any affiliate of any Company Rule 145 Affiliate,
shall be entitled to surrender any Certificates and Options held by such person
in exchange for (i) certificates of Parent Common Stock representing the stock
portion of the Merger Consideration to which such person is entitled, (ii)
payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds of the cash portion of
the Merger Consideration to which such person is entitled and (iii) in respect
of such surrendered Options, the cash that such person is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7 hereof.

         Section 2.3 DIVIDENDS; TRANSFER TAXES; WITHHOLDING. No dividends or
other distributions that are declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent
Common Stock, or are payable to the holders of record thereof who became such on
or after the Effective Time, shall be paid to any person entitled by reason of
the Merger to receive certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock,
until such person shall have surrendered its Certificate(s) as provided in
Section 2.2 hereof. Subject to applicable law, there shall be paid to each
person receiving a certificate representing such shares of Parent Common Stock,
at the time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the
amount of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such certificate and having a
record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date on or subsequent to such surrender. In no event shall the person
entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled to receive
interest on such dividends or other distributions. If any cash or certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a name
other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a



                                       6
<PAGE>   18

condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of such certificate representing shares
of Parent Common Stock and the distribution of such cash payment in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid
or is not applicable. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

         Section 2.4 FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to shares
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional share of
Parent Common Stock, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock an amount in cash (without interest) rounded to the nearest whole cent,
determined by multiplying (i) the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock
on the NYSE Composite Transactions List (as reprinted by The Wall Street
Journal) on the date on which the Effective Time shall occur (or, if Parent
Common Stock shall not trade on the NYSE on such date, the first day of trading
in Parent Common Stock thereafter) by (ii) the fractional interest in a share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

         Section 2.5 UNDISTRIBUTED EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund, together with any dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, which remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon its request, and any such former holders who have not
theretofore surrendered to the Exchange Agent their certificates in compliance
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their
claim for the applicable Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto (in each case, without interest thereon). None of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

         Section 2.6 DISSENTING SHARES. Each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock as to which a written demand for appraisal is duly made in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL at or prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and not
withdrawn at or prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and which is not voted
(or consented in writing)



                                       7
<PAGE>   19

in favor of adoption of this Agreement shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until the holder thereof
shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such
appraisal rights under said Section 262, at which time each such share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All such shares of
Company Common Stock as to which such a written demand for appraisal is so filed
and not withdrawn at or prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and which are
not voted (or consented in writing) in favor of adoption of this Agreement,
except any such shares of Company Common Stock the holder of which shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights under said Section 262, are
herein referred to as "Dissenting Shares." The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice upon receipt by the Company of any written demands for appraisal,
withdrawal of such demands, and any other written communications delivered to
the Company pursuant to said Section 262, and the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity, to the extent permitted by law, to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not settle or offer to settle any
such demands.

         Section 2.7 OPTIONS.

         (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such action as
may be necessary for all Options (as hereinafter defined) granted pursuant to
the Option Plan (as hereinafter defined) to be exercisable in full as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         (b) The Company shall take all requisite action such that, at the
Effective Time, all Cashout Options (as hereinafter defined) held by each
particular holder shall be canceled and such holder shall be entitled to receive
from the Company, in respect of each Cashout Option, cash (subject to any
applicable withholding tax) in an amount equal to the difference of (i) the
product of (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration, multiplied by (y) two and (ii)
the per share exercise price of such Cashout Option. From and after the
Effective Time, each Cashout Option shall only represent the right to receive
the cash payment provided in this Section 2.7(b).

         (c) The Company shall take all requisite action such that, at the
Effective Time, all Rollover Options (as hereinafter defined) held by each
particular holder shall be assumed by Parent and deemed to constitute an option
to acquire, except as provided in Section 2.7(f), on the same terms and
conditions, mutatis mutandis (including, without limitation adjustments for any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split or other
similar event), as were applicable under such Rollover Option prior to the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock the holder of such Rollover
Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such
holder exercised such Rollover Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time (not taking into account whether or not such Rollover Option was in fact
then exercisable), multiplied by (ii) two, at a price per share equal to (x) the
per share exercise price for a share of Company Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to such Rollover



                                       8
<PAGE>   20

Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (y) the
quotient realized by dividing (1) the product of (A) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, multiplied by (B) two, by (2) the Average Trading Price
calculated pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and subject to the adjustment limitations
contained therein.

         (d) The Company shall take all requisite action such that, at the
Effective Time, there shall not be outstanding any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire capital stock from the Surviving Corporation.

         (e) As used herein, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                 (i) "Options" shall mean the options issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time granted pursuant to the Company's 1997 Stock Option Plan
(the "Option Plan").

                 (ii) "Cashout Options" shall mean as to a particular holder of
Options, that number of Options that represent one-half of Economic Value (as
hereinafter defined) of all Options (rounded down to the nearest whole share of
Company Common Stock) held by such holder. In determining which Options of a
particular holder are to be treated as Cashout Options (x) to the extent
possible Cashout Options shall be allocated equally to each particular grant of
Options having different exercise prices and different remaining terms (provided
that in the case of Options held by a person who is a party to a Company
Severance Agreement, Cashout Options shall first be allocated to the Economic
Value of all Options, if any, held by such person the exercisability of which is
accelerated by Section 2.7(a) and second, as otherwise contemplated by this
clause (x)) and (y) Options that do not have a positive Economic Value shall not
be treated as a Cashout Option.

                 (iii) "Rollover Options" shall mean as to a particular holder
of Options, all Options held by such holder that are not Cashout Options.

                 (iv) "Economic Value" shall mean as to each Option held by a
particular holder the difference between (x) the per share exercise price
thereunder for a share of Company Common Stock, determined as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) the product of (1) the Per Share Cash
Consideration, multiplied by (2) two.

         (f) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be deemed to have waived and hereby agree not to enforce any
rights that they may have in respect of Rollover Options under Section 8 of the
Option Plan; provided that such waiver and agreement not to enforce such
provisions shall in respect of any Rollover Options that are Incentive Options
be conditioned upon the holder thereof executing and delivering to the Parent a
Consent Letter in the form of Exhibit "C" hereto consenting to the treatment
from and after the Effective Time of such Incentive Options as Non-Qualified
Options (as defined in the Option Plan).



                                       9
<PAGE>   21

         (g) In the event that the exercise of any Rollover Option would result
in the issuance of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock such fractional
share shall be aggregated with all other fractional shares attributable to all
other Rollover Options then being exercised by such holder and to the extent
that a fractional share thereafter remains then, such holder shall be entitled
to receive a cash payment for any such remaining fractional share based upon the
last sale price per share of Parent Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the date of exercise. Except as contemplated by Section 2.7(f), from
and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall comply
with the terms of the Option Plan.

         (h) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be taken all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Rollover Options in
accordance with this Section 2.7. At the Effective Time, Parent shall file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or appropriate
forms) with respect to the Parent Common Stock subject to the Rollover Options
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the effectiveness of such
registration statement as promptly as possible (and current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) and to thereafter maintain such
effectiveness for so long as any Rollover Options remain outstanding.

         Section 2.8 CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

         Section 2.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Parent shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take
and do all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to
vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to or under
such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

specified therein and such other representations and warranties contained herein
(regardless of whether or not such representation or warranty contains a
reference to such disclosure schedule) to the extent a matter in such disclosure
schedule is disclosed in such a way as to make its relevance to the information
called for by such other representation or warranty readily apparent on its
face) of the Company attached hereto (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

         Section 3.1 ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. The Company and each
Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) that is a Significant Subsidiary (as
hereinafter defined) and a corporation, is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, and each has the corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each Other Subsidiary (as hereinafter
defined) that is a corporation is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and
each has the corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure (i) to be so organized, validly
existing or in good standing, or (ii) to have such power and authority, would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect, individually or in
the aggregate, on the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the ability
of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (a "Company Material Adverse Effect"). Each other Subsidiary
that is a partnership or a limited liability company is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and each
has the power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where the failure (i) to be so organized and validly existing
or (ii) to have such power and authority, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary that is
a corporation is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business, and is
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As used in this Agreement, a "Subsidiary" of any person means any
corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, (i)
of which such party or any other Subsidiary of such party is a general partner
(excluding partnerships, the general partnership interests of which held by such
party or any Subsidiary of such party do not have a majority of the voting
interests in such partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or
other interests of which having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a
majority of the Board of Directors or others performing similar functions with
respect to such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly
owned or controlled by such party or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or
by such party and one or more of its Subsidiaries. As used in this Agreement, a
"Significant Subsidiary" has the meaning assigned to such term in Regulation S-X
promulgated under the Securities Act. As used in this Agreement, the term "Other
Subsidiary" shall mean any Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary.
Except as set forth in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company does not have any non-corporate subsidiaries.

complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of the Company and each of
its Significant Subsidiaries have been delivered to Parent. The Certificate of
Incorporation, By-laws and equivalent organizational documents (collectively the
"Charter Documents") of the Company and each of its Significant Subsidiaries are
in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Significant
Subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its Charter Documents. The
Charter Documents of each Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary are in
full force and effect, and no such Subsidiary is in violation of any provision
of its Charter Documents, except where the failure of such Charter Documents to
be in full force and effect, or where such violation, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

Company nor its Subsidiaries have any obligations, contingent or otherwise, to

equity interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries (individually or in the aggregate), directly or
indirectly, owns, or has agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire, the capital

Voting Agreements, the Board of Directors of the Company (at a meeting duly
called and held) has (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the

Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has taken all steps
necessary to approve and irrevocably exempt the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Stock Voting Agreements from the provisions of Section
203 of the DGCL and from any applicable charter, organizational document or
other agreement, arrangement or understanding to which the Company is a party
containing any change of control, "anti-takeover" or similar provision. To the

licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities (as

Company Permits, (x) no action or proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of

or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration, violation, conflict, default, right,
loss or Lien that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be

<PAGE>   27

the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and none of the
Company SEC Documents contained, and the Subsequent Company SEC Documents will
not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or will omit,

made, or are to be made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements
(including related notes) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents

former directors or officers or any other person whom the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify, as such, that (individually or in the

except for such actions contemplated by Section 6.13 that may arise after the
date hereof, or as set forth in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule

                                       18

Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been a member of any affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of
the Code other than the affiliated group of which the Company is the common
parent corporation; (x) the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for

course and in a manner consistent with past practices, and (xi) the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or, in the case of clause (a) below, each of the Subsidiaries)
as of the most recent practicable date (as well as on an estimated pro forma
basis as of the Closing giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) do not have any: (a) excess loss accounts as defined in
Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-19; (b) Code Section 481 adjustments allocable to the
Company or any Subsidiary; or (c) deferred gains or losses allocable to the

Tax Return of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries is currently in
progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated, in
each case, which involve claims that, individually or in the aggregate, are
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been informed by any jurisdiction that the
jurisdiction believes that Company or any of its Subsidiaries was required to
file any Tax Return that was not filed which failure or failures, individually
or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code in connection with the

         (e) Except as set forth in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule,

the total potential withdrawal liability of a specified obligor for any such
plan over the amount shown in Section 3.17(c) of the Company Disclosure

complete copies of the Certificates of Incorporation and By-laws or equivalent
organizational documents, each as amended to date, of Parent and Merger Sub have

Subsidiaries holds, and is in compliance with the terms of, all permits,
licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities
necessary for the conduct of their respective business ("Parent Permits"),
except for failures to hold or to comply with such Parent Permits which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) with respect to the Parent Permits, no action or
proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no fact exists or event has occurred that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries is
being conducted in compliance with all Applicable Laws of any Governmental
Entity, except for violations or failures to so comply that would not,
individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect; and (iv) no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, other than, in each case, those which would
not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.6 NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution and delivery by Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof will not, (i)
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under, any
Contract binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision
of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or other equivalent
organizational document, in each case as amended, of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) conflict with or violate any judgment, order, decree,
statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default, right,
loss or Lien that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.7 GOVERNMENT APPROVALS; REQUIRED CONSENTS. No filing or
registration with, or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Entity is required by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub or is necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated

         Section 4.8 SEC DOCUMENTS AND OTHER REPORTS. Parent has filed all
documents required to be filed prior to the date hereof by it and its
Subsidiaries with the SEC since May 25, 1997 (the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of
their respective dates, or if amended as of the date of the last such amendment,
the Parent SEC Documents complied, and all documents required to be filed by
Parent with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time
("Subsequent Parent SEC Documents; provided, however, that the Subsequent Parent
SEC Documents shall not include the Registration Statement") will comply, in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and none of the Parent SEC Documents contained, and the Subsequent
Parent SEC Documents will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted, or will omit, to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not misleading. The
consolidated financial statements (including related notes) of Parent included
in the Parent SEC Documents fairly present in all material respects, and the
consolidated financial statements (including related notes) of Parent included
in the Subsequent Parent SEC Documents will fairly present in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods
then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and to any other adjustments described therein and the fact
that certain information and notes have been condensed or omitted in accordance
with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) in
conformity with GAAP (except in the case of the unaudited statements) applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto). Since May 30, 1999, Parent has not made any
change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its
financial statements, except as may be required by GAAP.

in the Parent SEC Documents, since May 30, 1999, Parent and its Subsidiaries
have conducted their respective businesses and operations in all material
respects in the ordinary and usual course consistent with past practice and,
except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, there has not occurred (i)
through the date hereof, any change in the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or the results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries that

declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or distribution of any
kind by Parent on any class of its capital stock (other than regular quarterly

payable by Parent or any Subsidiary to its directors, officers or management
employees or any material increase in any bonus, insurance, pension or other
employee benefit plan, payment or arrangement made to, for or with such
directors, officers or management employees; (iv) any material change by Parent
or its Subsidiaries in accounting methods, principles or practices except as

         Section 4.10 INFORMATION IN DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS AND REGISTRATION
STATEMENT. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub for inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement or (ii) the Proxy
Statement will, in the case of the Registration Statement, at the time it
becomes effective or, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the initial mailing of the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the
meeting of stockholders of the Company to be held in connection with the Merger,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Registration Statement, as of its effective date, will comply
(with respect to information relating to Parent and Merger Sub) as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and as of the date of its initial
mailing and as of the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Proxy
Statement will comply (with respect to information relating to Parent and Merger
Sub) as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulated thereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation with respect
to any statement in the foregoing documents based upon information supplied by
the Company for inclusion therein.

         Section 4.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; ERISA. Except as described in any
of the Parent SEC Documents, as of the date hereof all "employee benefit plans"
as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained or contributed to by Parent or
its Subsidiaries are in material compliance with their terms and all applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable legislation, and Parent
and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or obligations with respect to
any such employee benefit plans, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, except (a) as described in any of the Parent SEC Documents and (b)



                                       31
<PAGE>   43

for instances of noncompliance or liabilities or obligations that would not in
the aggregate have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.12 LACK OF OWNERSHIP OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Neither Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of Company Common Stock or other
securities convertible into shares of Company Common Stock (exclusive of any
shares owned by Parent's employee benefit plans).

         Section 4.13 REQUIRED VOTE OF PARENT STOCKHOLDERS. No vote of the
stockholders of Parent or Merger Sub (other than written consent of Parent Sub
as sole shareholder of Merger Sub to the adoption of this Agreement, which
written consent is being delivered contemporaneously with the execution of this
Agreement) is required by law or by the charter or by-laws of Parent or Merger
Sub in order for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 4.14 ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. As of the date hereof,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities or
obligations or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, known or unknown,
contingent or otherwise) of a type required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet, other than (i) liabilities or obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 1999, (ii) liabilities or
obligations reflected in any of the Parent SEC Documents and (iii) liabilities
or obligations which would not in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Section 6.1  ACCESS AND INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY.


         (a) The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents to) afford
to Parent and to Parent's officers, employees, financial advisors, legal
counsel, accountants, consultants and other representatives (except to the
extent not permitted under Applicable Law as advised by counsel) reasonable
access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time to all of its books and records and its properties, plants and personnel
and, during such period, shall furnish promptly to Parent a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements
of federal securities laws. Parent shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective officers, directors, employees, auditors and agents to)
afford to the Company and to the Company's officers, employees, financial
advisors, legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other representatives
(except to the extent not permitted under Applicable Law as advised by counsel)
reasonable access (i) by the Company throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time to members of senior management of Parent to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Company's Board of Directors to fulfill its
fiduciary duties under applicable laws, and (ii) by Chase throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to members of senior management of Parent and to
such of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' books and records as reasonably determined
by Chase to be necessary in connection with any bringdowns or amendments of its
fairness opinion.

         (b) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
Confidentiality Agreement dated December 2, 1998, between the Company and
Parent, as amended by that certain letter agreement dated June 9, 2000, between
the Company and Parent (together, the "Confidentiality Agreement") is in full
force and effect as of the date hereof.

         Section 6.2 NO SOLICITATION.

         (a) The Company shall immediately cease any existing discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal (as hereinafter defined). The Company shall not directly or
indirectly, and it shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
representatives, agents or affiliates, including any investment bankers,
attorneys or accountants (collectively, "Representatives") retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates not to, (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information)
any inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a proposal or offer for a merger, tender offer, recapitalization,
consolidation, business combination, sale or other disposition of all or a
substantial portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, sale of 15% or more of the shares of capital stock (including by way of
a tender offer, share exchange or exchange offer) or similar or comparable
transactions involving the



                                       36
<PAGE>   48


Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (any one or combination of the foregoing inquiries or proposals
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Takeover Proposal"), (ii) engage in
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information to
any person or entity relating to, any Takeover Proposal, or which may reasonably
be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, or (iii) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to any such Takeover Proposal or which
would require it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at
any time prior to adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
furnish information (pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement no more
favorable, in the aggregate, to the party receiving information than the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
require approval or request of the Company's Board of Directors prior to making
an inquiry or Takeover Proposal to the Company or its Board of Directors to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, any person in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Takeover Proposal of such person, if, and only to
the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to the Company, determines
in good faith that such Takeover Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined herein) and (B) prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person,
the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such person and the Company complies with Section 6.2(c).

         (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company's Board of Directors shall be permitted, at any time prior to adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, (i) to withdraw, modify or
change, or propose to withdraw, modify or change, the recommendation by the
Board of Directors of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, the Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith that failure
to take such action would result in a breach by the Company's Board of Directors
of its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law; or (ii) in response to an
unsolicited Takeover Proposal, to approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal and, in connection therewith, to withdraw,
modify or change the approval or recommendation by the Board of Directors of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, but only if, in the case referred to in clause (ii), the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith that such Takeover Proposal, if
consummated, would constitute a Superior Proposal. "Superior Proposal" means any
written Takeover Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel)
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the person making the proposal, (i) would, if consummated, result
in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company's stockholders (in their
capacity as stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed
(provided that for purposes of this definition the term "Takeover Proposal"
shall



                                       37
<PAGE>   49
have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.2(a), except that (x) the
reference to "15%" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be
a reference to "50%", (y) "Takeover Proposal" must be a transaction involving
the Company, and (z) no such sale or other disposition of assets shall be deemed
to be a "sale or other disposition of all" or "substantial" unless such sale or
other disposition is for at least 75% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Any withdrawal, modification or change in the
recommendation or the determination to do so of the Company's Board of Directors
of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby made
in accordance with this Section 6.2(b) shall not constitute a breach of the
Company's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. Following termination of this Agreement, a public offering by the
Company of its voting securities (excluding, however, a secondary offering of
securities currently held by affiliates of the Company) in a manner intended to
result in a broad distribution of such securities will not constitute a
"Takeover Proposal."

         (c) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and no later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company of any
Takeover Proposal or any request for non-public information in connection with a
Takeover Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of the
Company by any person or entity that informs the Company that it is considering
making, or has made, a Takeover Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and
in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror
and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact to the extent
available to the Company. The Company agrees to keep Parent informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal
(including any material changes to the details or terms thereof) and the status
of any such discussions or negotiations.

         (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors (i) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
from making any legally required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company
or (ii) prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, from taking any action as contemplated by Section 8.1(e).

         Section 6.3 THIRD-PARTY STANDSTILL AGREEMENTS. During the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, the Company shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except
that the Company shall not be required hereunder to enforce, and may waive the
terms of, any such confidentiality or standstill agreement that restricts any
third party from making an inquiry or Takeover Proposal to the Company or its
Board of Directors, if, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the
Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith that enforcement of such
terms or failure to waive such terms would result in a breach by the Company's
Board of Directors of its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law.
Simultaneously with any such waiver or such action, the Company shall be deemed
to have made such waiver, or taken such action, with respect to



                                       38
<PAGE>   50
the Confidentiality Agreement, to the same extent as such waiver or action was
taken with respect to such other confidentiality or standstill agreement.

         Section 6.4 REGISTRATION STATEMENT. As promptly as practicable, Parent
and the Company shall in consultation with each other prepare and file with the
SEC the Proxy Statement and Registration Statement in preliminary form. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws as soon as
practicable and keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. The Company shall furnish Parent with all
information concerning the Company and the holders of its capital stock and
shall take such other action Parent may reasonably request in connection with
the Registration Statement and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
event or circumstance relating to the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or their respective officers or directors,
should be discovered by such party which should be set forth in an amendment or
a supplement to the Registration Statement or Proxy Statement, such party shall
promptly inform the other thereof and take appropriate action in respect
thereof.

         Section 6.5 PROXY STATEMENTS; STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.

         (a) The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject
to and in accordance with Applicable Law, its Certificate of Incorporation and
its By-Laws, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as
practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes
effective and the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of voting to adopt this
Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), and, (i) except as set forth in
Sections 6.2(b) or 6.2(d), recommend adoption of this Agreement to the
stockholders of the Company and include in the Proxy Statement such
recommendation and (ii) except to the extent that the Company's Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside legal counsel, concludes in good
faith that such action is not consistent with the Company's Board of Director's
fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law take all reasonable action to solicit
and obtain such approval.

         (b) The Company, as promptly as practicable, shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as soon as practicable
following the date on which it is cleared by the SEC and the Registration
Statement is declared effective.

         Section 6.6 COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list
(reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Parent) identifying each person who, at
the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, may be deemed to be an "affiliate"
of the Company, as such term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under
the Securities Act (the "Company Rule 145 Affiliates"). The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is the



                                       39
<PAGE>   51


identified as a Company Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Parent on
or prior to the Effective Time a written agreement, substantially in the form of
Exhibit "D" hereto.

         Section 6.7 OTHER ACTIONS.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and applicable
legal requirements, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as
promptly as practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to ensure that the conditions set forth in
Article VII are satisfied and to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b) Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
as promptly as practicable all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
permits of, or registration or filing with or notification to (any of the
foregoing being a "Consent"), of any Governmental Entity or any other person
required in connection with, and waivers of any violations, defaults or breaches
that may be caused by, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (c) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication from the SEC, the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto or
any affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request.

         (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will, and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to, obtain all authorizations
or waivers required under the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada) and the
Mexican Federal Economic Competition Law (the "Mexican Law") to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, making all
filings with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the
Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Competition Bureau (Canada) and the
Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission ("Mexican Commission") required
in connection therewith (the initial filing with DOJ and FTC to occur no later
than five (5) business days, and the initial filing with Competition Bureau
(Canada) and the Mexican Commission to occur no later than ten (10) business
days, following the execution and delivery of this Agreement unless mutually
agreed otherwise) and responding as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from the DOJ, FTC, the Competition Bureau (Canada) or the Mexican
Commission for additional information or documentation. Each of Parent and the
Company shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any
filing or submission which



                                       40
<PAGE>   52
is necessary under the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada) and Mexican Law.
Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any communications with, and any inquiries or requests
for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ, the Competition Bureau
(Canada) and the Mexican Commission. In the event a suit is threatened or
instituted challenging the Merger as violating of the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, the Competition Act (Canada), as amended, the Mexican Law, as amended,
or any other federal, state or foreign law or regulation or decree designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint or trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), each
party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the filing of, or
resist or resolve such suit. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take such action as may be required, and Parent shall take all actions as may
be required, in order to obtain clearance under the HSR Act, the Competition Act
(Canada) and the Mexican Law in order to consummate the Merger prior to the
Termination Date (as hereinafter defined). Parent shall be entitled to direct
any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental Entity relating to any of
the foregoing, provided that it shall afford Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. In addition, Parent shall, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, take such action as may be required by any federal
or state court of the United States, in any suit brought by any Governmental
Entity or any other person challenging the Merger as violative of the Antitrust
Laws, or in proceedings threatened by the Commissioner of Competition to bring
an application under the Competition Act (Canada) or proceedings threatened by
the Mexican Commission under the Mexican Law in order to avoid the entry of any
permanent injunction or other permanent order which has the effect of preventing
the consummation of the Merger prior to the Termination Date, and in the event
that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would prevent or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent shall take promptly any and all
steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond) necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation
prior to the Termination Date.

         (e) Failure of Parent to obtain clearance or expiration of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada) or the Mexican
Law, as applicable, or to cause to be vacated, modified or suspended any
injunction or order resulting from a claim that the Merger is violative of the
Antitrust Laws, in either case resulting in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or prior to the Termination Date, shall be deemed a material
breach by Parent of this Section 6.7, unless such failure results from the
Company's failure, in any material respects, to perform its obligations set
forth in Section 6.7(d).

         (f) If Parent is required to take any action in order to comply with
this Section 6.7, Parent may take such action concurrently with the closing of
the Merger on the Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement shall require
Parent to take such action prior to the Closing Date.



                                       41

         Section 6.8 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Parent and the Company shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to consult with each other before issuing any
press releases or making any public statement with respect to the transactions
by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
law or obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange.

         Section 6.9 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.

         (a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that all rights to
indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
Indemnitee (as hereinafter defined) as provided in the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation, Company's By-laws, charter or By-laws of any Subsidiary of the
Company or any Indemnity Agreement (as hereinafter defined) shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by
law. To the extent permitted by (i) the DGCL, or (ii) any agreement disclosed in
Section 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule which provides for
indemnification by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company of any
Indemnitee in effect on the date of this Agreement (including any indemnity
provisions contained in any agreement disclosed in Section 6.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule which provides for the registration of securities) (each, an
"Indemnity Agreement"), advancement of Indemnitee Expenses (as hereinafter
defined) pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be mandatory rather than permissive
and the Surviving Corporation shall advance Costs (as hereinafter defined) in
connection with such indemnification, in all such cases subject to receipt of
any undertaking to repay required by the DGCL. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to expressly assume at Closing and thereafter honor in accordance
with their terms, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, all Indemnity
Agreements. With respect to any determination of whether an Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification by the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.9(a), the Indemnitee shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to
require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel
selected by Indemnitee and approved by the Company (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed material services
for the Company or for Indemnitee within the last three (3) years. For the
purposes of this Section 6.9, (i) "Indemnitee Expenses" shall include reasonable
attorneys' fees and all other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in
connection with investigation, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in
any Indemnifiable Claim (as hereinafter defined), (ii) an "Indemnitee" shall
mean any individual who on or prior to the Effective Time was an employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the heirs,
executors, trustees, fiduciaries and administrators of any such employee,
officer or director, (iii) "Costs" shall mean all losses, Indemnitee Expenses,
claims, damages, liabilities, judgments, or amounts paid in settlement in
respect to any Indemnifiable Claim, and (iv) "Indemnifiable Claim" shall mean
any actual or alleged act, omission, statement, misstatement, event, or
occurrence related to the fact that Indemnitee is or was a director, officer,
agent, employee, or fiduciary of the Company, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, agent, employee, or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, employee benefit
plan, trust,



                                       42
<PAGE>   54


or other enterprise, or by reason of any actual or alleged thing done or not
done by Indemnitee in any such capacity. For purposes of this provision, the
Company agrees that Indemnitee's service on behalf of or with respect to any
Subsidiary or employee benefits plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company shall be deemed to be at the request of the Company.

         (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers' and directors'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering the Indemnitees
who are currently covered by the Company's existing officers' and directors' or
fiduciary liability insurance policies on terms no less advantageous to such
indemnified parties than such existing insurance; provided, however, that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required in order to
maintain such policies to pay an annual premium in excess of 150% of the greater
of (i) the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement and (ii) the annual premium for the year in which the Closing occurs
(the "Cap"); and provided, further, that, if equivalent coverage cannot be
obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the
Cap, then Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
policies that, in Parent's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Cap.

         (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to alter, amend or otherwise modify the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation in any manner that
adversely affects or otherwise prejudices the rights of any of the Indemnified
Parties under this Section 6.9.

         (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent contained in this Section 6.9
shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so
that successors and assigns of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
6.9.

         (e) The obligations of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, and
Parent under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section
6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, each of whom
may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9).

         Section 6.10 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise set forth in Sections 8.2(b)
and (c), each party hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



                                       43
<PAGE>   55


         Section 6.11 LISTING APPLICATION. Parent shall cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement in the Merger or
upon exercise of the Rollover Options to be listed for trading on the New York
Stock Exchange or on any securities exchange on which shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be listed at the Effective Time.

         Section 6.12 SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of
which would be likely to cause (x) any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any
covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall not have any effect for the
purpose of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
VII of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party.

         Section 6.13 STOCKHOLDER LITIGATION. The Company shall give Parent the
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The assertion or filing of any such litigation shall not be
a breach of Section 3.11 or Section 3.12.

         Section 6.14 TAX MATTERS. The parties acknowledge their respective
desire to structure the Merger to constitute a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, provided, however, such tax treatment shall not
be a condition to either parties' obligation to close the transactions
contemplated herein. Parent and the Company will use their reasonable good faith
efforts to achieve such tax treatment. If based upon the Reorganization
Assumptions (as defined below), the fair market value (determined as of the
Effective Time) of the stock consideration provided in the Merger would be at
least 40% of the fair market value (determined as of the Effective Time) of the
total consideration received by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
Merger, the Company shall deliver to Parent an opinion of Vinson & Elkins
L.L.P., special counsel to the Company, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
"E" to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that accordingly the Company will not
recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the
Merger, and stockholders of the Company that do not elect dissenters' rights
will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes, except to the
extent of the cash payment made pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof and any cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, (the "Tax
Opinion"). The issuance of the Tax Opinion shall be conditioned on the receipt
by such tax counsel of representation letters from each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and certain stockholders of the Company, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Vinson & Elkins L.L.P. The specific
provisions of each such representation letter shall be in form and substance
reasonably



                                       44
<PAGE>   56


satisfactory to such tax counsel, and each such representation letter shall be
dated on or before the date of such opinion and shall not have been withdrawn or
modified in any material respect. For purposes of this Agreement the term
"Reorganization Assumptions" shall mean the following assumptions: (A) the
average consideration paid to all dissenting stockholders of the Company in
satisfaction of their appraisal rights is $22 per share of Company Common Stock,
and (B) the fair market value of Parent Common Stock as of the Effective Time is
equal to the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
at the end of the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time of the
Merger.

         Section 6.15 INVESTIGATION AND AGREEMENT BY THE PARTIES; NO OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES.

         (a) Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other, each acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the other party and its Subsidiaries and their businesses and
operations, and such party has requested such documents and information from the
other party as such party considers material in determining whether to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, acknowledge and agree that it has had an opportunity to ask all
questions of and receive answers from the other party with respect to any matter
such party considers material in determining whether to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In
connection with each party's investigation of the other party and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses and operations, each party and its
representatives have received from the other party or its representatives
certain projections and other forecasts for the other party and its Subsidiaries
and certain estimates, plans and budget information. Each party acknowledges and
agrees that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans and budgets; that such party is
familiar with such uncertainties; that such party is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it or its
representatives; and that such party will not (and will cause all of its
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates or any other person acting on its
behalf to not) assert any claim or cause of action against any of the other
party's direct or indirect partners, directors, officers, employees, agents,
stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers
or representatives with respect thereto, or hold any such other person liable
with respect thereto.

         (b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other, agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by
the other party that are expressly set forth in Article III and Article IV of
this Agreement, as applicable, neither the other party nor any of its
representatives or Affiliates has made and shall not be deemed to have made to
such party or to any of its representatives or Affiliates any representation or
warranty of any kind. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
party agrees that



                                       45
<PAGE>   57


neither the other party nor any of its Affiliates makes or has made any
representation or warranty to such party or to any of its representatives or
Affiliates with respect to:

                  (i) any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of
future revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of the other party or any of its
Subsidiaries or the future business, operations or affairs of the other party or
any of its Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available
to such party or its counsel, accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or
Affiliates; and

                  (ii) any other information, statement or documents heretofore
or hereafter delivered to or made available to such party or its counsel,
accountants, advisors, lenders, representatives or Affiliates with respect to
the other party or any of its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or
affairs of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and
as expressly covered by a representation and warranty made by the other party
and contained in Article III or Article IV of this Agreement, as applicable.

         Section 6.16 RESIGNATIONS. At Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent written resignations of the directors of the Company, together with those
officers designated by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the Effective
Time.

         Section 6.17 AMENDMENT OF ADVISORY AND OVERSIGHT AGREEMENTS.
Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall execute,
and deliver to Parent a true and correct copy of, (a) an amendment to the
Advisory Agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit "F" (the
"Advisory Agreement Amendment") and (b) an amendment to the Oversight Agreement
in substantially the form attached as Exhibit "G" (the "Oversight Agreement
Amendment").

         Section 6.18 SECTION 16(b) BOARD APPROVAL.

         (a) Prior to Closing, the Board of Directors of Parent shall, by
resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve and adopt, for purposes
of exemption from "short-swing" liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the acquisition of Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time by officers
and directors of Parent (including officers or directors of the Company who
become, prior to, at, or following the Effective Time of the Merger, officers or
directors of Parent) as a result of the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock in the Merger and the assumption of the Options by Parent at the Effective
Time. Such resolution shall set forth the name of the applicable "insiders" for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the number of securities to be
acquired by each individual, that the approval is being granted to exempt the
transaction under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and, for the Options to be
assumed by Parent at the Effective Time, the material terms of the options and
warrants to purchase Parent Common Stock acquired by such insiders as a result
of the assumption by Parent of such Options.



                                       46
<PAGE>   58


         (b) Prior to Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall, by
resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a duly authorized
committee of "non-employee directors" thereof, approve and adopt, for purposes
of exemption from "short-swing" liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the conversion at the Effective Time of the shares of the Company Common
Stock held by officers and directors of the Company into shares of Parent Common
Stock as a result of the conversion of shares in the Merger, and the assumption
and cashout by Parent at the Effective Time of the Options of the officers and
directors of the Company. Such resolution shall set forth the name of the
applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and, for
each "insider," the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted
into shares of Parent Common Stock at the Effective Time, the number and
material terms of the Options to be assumed and cashed out by Parent at the
Effective Time, and that the approval is being granted to exempt the transaction
under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

         Section 6.19 TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall transfer the assets set forth on Section 6.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, on an as is, where is basis, with no warranties, to an entity in which
the Company has no equity interest. As consideration for such assets, such
entity shall assume the lease described on Section 6.19 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (and obtain a release of the Company with respect thereto),
and shall assume all other obligations with respect to such leased premises,
including, without limitation, utilities, phone system, and equipment lease
obligations. Such transfer, assignment and release shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

         Section 6.20 OTHER REGISTRATION STATEMENTS. Parent shall perform, in
all material respects, its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement
required to be performed prior to the Effective Time.

         Section 6.21 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. A true, correct and complete
copy of the written opinion delivered by Chase as set forth in Section 3.20,
which opinion shall be included in the Proxy Statement, has been delivered to
Parent by the Company.

         Section 6.22 401(k) PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS. The Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, cause a distribution of vested account balances from the
Company's 401(k) plan, to each employee participating in the plan who terminates
employment with the Company and all ERISA Affiliates after the Closing Date, as
soon as administratively feasible following such employee's termination of
employment, to the extent permissible under applicable law and not inconsistent
with any other contractual obligation of the Surviving Corporation, its
Subsidiaries or Parent; provided, however, the preceding shall not prohibit the
transfer of the assets and liabilities of any Company 401(k) plan to a 401(k)
plan of the Parent.

                    CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

         Section 7.1 CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER.
The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject
to the satisfaction or waiver at or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

         (a) STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. This Agreement shall have been adopted by the
requisite vote (as described in Section 3.5(b)) of the stockholders of the
Company in accordance with Applicable Law.

         (b) GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS. All authorizations, consents, orders,
declarations or approvals of, or filings with, or terminations or expirations of
waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental Entity, which the failure to
obtain, make or occur would have the effect of making the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent or the Company (as the Surviving Corporation) or would materially
impair the operations of the Surviving Corporation, assuming the Merger had
taken place, shall have been obtained, shall have been made or shall have
occurred.

         (c) WAITING PERIODS. The waiting period (and any extension thereof)
under the HSR Act, the Competition Act (Canada) and the Mexican Law, as
applicable shall have expired or been terminated and, as applicable, clearance
thereunder shall have been obtained.

         (d) REGISTRATION STATEMENT. The Registration Statement shall have
become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act. No
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall have
been issued by the SEC and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been
initiated by the SEC.

         (e) NO INJUNCTION. No Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) which is then in effect and has the effect of making the Merger or
the Stock Voting Agreements illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Merger.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1, if the
conditions set forth herein shall not be satisfied due to Parent's failure to
comply with Section 6.7(d) or (e), such failure shall not be excused by the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1 and such failure shall constitute a
material breach of this Agreement.

         Section 7.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB TO EFFECT
THE MERGER. The obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger shall
be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following additional conditions, unless waived in writing by Parent:

<PAGE>   60


         (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each of the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak expressly as of an earlier
date) as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the Effective Time;
provided, however, that this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied
unless the individual or aggregate impact of all inaccuracies of such
representations and warranties (without regard to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and each such representation or
warranty) would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to such effect.

         (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The Company shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive
Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to such effect.

         Section 7.3 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY TO EFFECT THE
MERGER. The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger shall be subject to
the satisfaction at or prior to the Effective Time of the following additional
conditions, unless waived in writing by the Company:

         (a) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Each of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and
(except to the extent such representations and warranties speak expressly as of
an earlier date) as of the Effective Time as though made on and as of the
Effective Time; provided, however, that this condition shall be deemed to have
been satisfied unless the individual or aggregate impact of all inaccuracies of
such representations and warranties (without regard to any materiality or
Material Adverse Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and each such
representation or warranty) would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The
Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such
effect.

         (b) PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall have performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Effective
Time, and the Company shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

         (c) STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger or upon exercise of the Rollover Options shall have been
authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of listing.

         (d) REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Parent shall have complied in
all material respects with its obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement required to be performed prior to the Effective Time.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   TERMINATION

         Section 8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company under the following circumstances:

         (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

         (b) by either Parent or the Company, if (i) the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before November 30, 2000, as such date may be extended by
the 15-day cure period provided for in Sections 8.1(d) and (f) (the "Termination
Date"), or (ii) the stockholders of the Company do not adopt this Agreement by
the requisite vote at a meeting duly convened therefor or any adjournment
thereof; provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
clause (i) of this Section 8.1(b) shall not have breached in any material
respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
proximately contributed to the failure to consummate the Merger on or before the
Termination Date; and provided, further, that Parent shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause (i) of this Section 8.1(b) if the
Merger shall not have become effective prior to the Termination Date due to
Parent's failure to comply with Section 6.7(d) or (e), which failure shall
constitute a material breach of this Agreement by Parent;

         (c) by either Parent or the Company, if any permanent injunction,
order, decree or ruling by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction
preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, however, that the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall have used reasonable best
efforts to remove such injunction or overturn such action; provided, further,
that Parent shall have no right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(c) if the Merger shall not become effective prior to the Termination Date
due to Parent's failure to comply with Section 6.7(d) or (e), which failure
shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement by Parent;

         (d) by Parent, if (i) there has been a material breach of the
representations or warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company set forth
in this Agreement, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not cured
within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is given by Parent
to the Company; provided, however, that this termination right under this clause
(i) of this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available unless the individual or
aggregate impact of all inaccuracies of such representations and warranties
(without regard to



                                       50
<PAGE>   62


any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and
each such representation or warranty) would have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, or (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company (x) fails to convene a
meeting of the Company's stockholders to adopt this Agreement on or before the
later of (A) November 28, 2000, or (B) within 45 days (but not sooner than 20
business days after the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
stockholders) following the date that the Registration Statement shall have
become effective and the Proxy Statement has been cleared by the SEC, or, in
either case, postpones the date scheduled for the meeting of the stockholders of
the Company to adopt this Agreement beyond such date, except, in either case (1)
with the written consent of Parent, or (2) if such failure or postponement is
due to a breach by Parent of this Agreement, (y) fails to recommend the adoption
of this Agreement to the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section
6.5(a) hereof, or (z) withdraws or amends or modifies in a manner adverse to
Parent its recommendation or approval in respect of this Agreement or the Merger
or fails to reconfirm such recommendation within two business days of a written
request for such confirmation by Parent;

         (e) by the Company, prior to adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company concurrently with the Company, entering into a
definitive acquisition, merger or similar agreement to effect a Superior
Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this subsection (e) unless (i) five days shall have elapsed after
delivery to Parent of a written notice of the Company's intention to so
terminate this Agreement and informing Parent of the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and the identity of the person or group making such
Superior Proposal, and (ii) at the end of such five (5) day period, the Board of
Directors of the Company believes that such proposal for Superior Proposal is
still superior to the transaction contemplated under this Agreement as such may
be modified as proposed by Parent. During such five (5) day period, the Company
shall fully cooperate with Parent in a manner consistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors with the intent of enabling Parent to agree to
propose for the consideration of the Company's Board of Directors a modification
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be effected; and

         (f) by the Company, if there has been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties, covenants or agreements of Parent or Merger Sub
set forth in this Agreement, which breach is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such breach is given by
the Company to Parent; provided, however, that this termination right under this
Section 8.1(f) shall not be available unless the individual or aggregate impact
of all inaccuracies of such representations and warranties (without regard to
any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifier(s) contained in any and
each such representation or warranty) would have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

         Section 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

         (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Article VIII, the Merger shall be deemed abandoned and this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, except



                                       51
<PAGE>   63


that the provisions of Section 6.10, this Section 8.2, Article IX and the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any
party from liability for any breach of this Agreement; provided that, subject to
Section 8.2(d), nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
breaches hereof which at a minimum shall be the reasonable expenses incurred by
of the non-breaching party in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

         (b) If (A) Parent shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii) (x), (y) or (z), or (B) the Company shall have terminated
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then, in any such case, the Company
shall pay Parent within one (1) business day following such termination, a
termination fee of $50,000,000, payable by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.

         (c) If Parent or Company shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(ii), and within twelve (12) months after the date of such
termination the Company (i) consummates a Takeover Proposal, or (ii) enters into
a Definitive Agreement to do so (or a tender offer with respect thereto is
commenced), then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent, within one (1)
business day following consummation of any Takeover Proposal, a termination fee
of $50,000,000, payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, receipt
by Parent of the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c)
shall constitute full settlement of any and all liabilities of the Company for
damages under this Agreement in respect of a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(ii)(x), (y) or (z), 8.1(e), or 8.1(b)(ii).


                                   ARTICLE IX

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         Section 9.1 AMENDMENT AND MODIFICATION. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, this Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented by written agreement (referring specifically to this Agreement) of
Parent and the Company with respect to any of the terms contained herein;
provided, however, that after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, no such amendment, modification or supplementation shall be made
which under Applicable Law requires the approval of such stockholders, without
the further approval of such stockholders.

         Section 9.2 WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (i) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the



                                       52
<PAGE>   64


representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any documents
delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein which may legally be waived. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing specifically referring to this Agreement and signed on behalf of such
party.

         Section 9.3 SURVIVABILITY; INVESTIGATIONS. The respective
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, contained herein or in any certificates or other
documents delivered prior to or as of the Effective Time (i) shall not be deemed
waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by any party hereto and
(ii) shall not survive beyond the Effective Time. The covenants and agreements
of the parties hereto (including the Surviving Corporation after the Merger)
shall survive the Effective Time, without limitation (except for those which, by
their terms, contemplate a shorter survival period).

         Section 9.4 NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or by next-day courier or
telecopied with confirmation of receipt, to the parties at the addresses
specified below (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by
like notice; provided that notices of a change of address shall be effective

         Section 9.5 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. References in this
Agreement to Sections, Exhibits or Articles mean a Section, Exhibit or Article
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. References to this Agreement shall
be deemed to include the Exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule,
unless the context otherwise requires. The term "person" shall mean and include
an individual, a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a limited
liability company, a trust, a Governmental Entity or an unincorporated
organization. The disclosure of any matter in any section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by any party
or to otherwise imply that any such matter is material or may have a Company
Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Agreement.

         Section 9.6 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Stock Voting Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

         Section 9.7 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the provisions thereof relating to conflicts of law.

         Section 9.8 ENFORCEMENT. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to



                                       54
<PAGE>   66


enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware or in Delaware state court,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a federal or state court
sitting in the State of Delaware.

         Section 9.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 9.10 ASSIGNMENT; THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement and
the rights, interests and obligations hereunder shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
provided, however, that no party hereto may assign or otherwise transfer its
rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. Except for the provisions of Article II and Section
6.9, nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

         Section 9.11 NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. Each of the following is
herein referred to as a "Company Affiliate:" (a) any direct or indirect holder
of any equity interests or securities in the Company (whether limited or general
partners, members, stockholders, or otherwise), (b) any Affiliate of the
Company, or (c) any director, officer, employee, representative or agent of (i)
the Company, (ii) any Affiliate of the Company, or (iii) any such holder of
equity interests or securities referred to in clause (a) above. Except to the
extent that a Company Affiliate is an express signatory party thereto, no
Company Affiliate shall have any liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement, the Stock Voting
Agreements or the Registration Rights Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and Parent and Merger Sub hereby waive and release all claims
of any such liability and obligation, except as set forth below. Notwithstanding
the provisions of the preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub neither waive
nor release, any claims that they may otherwise have against any Company
Affiliate for such Company Affiliate's actual, intentional misrepresentation (a)
of any fact to the Company's independent auditors, or any item reflected in the
Company's SEC Documents or Subsequent SEC Documents, and (b) to the extent that
such misrepresentation has caused the Company SEC Documents or Subsequent SEC
Documents to materially misstate the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, at such date, or the consolidated results of their
operations and their consolidated cash flow for the period then ended.

         Section 9.12 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

         Section 9.13 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any action or law or equity, including
an action for declaratory relief, is brought to enforce or interpret any
provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses from the other party, which fees and
expenses shall be in addition to any other relief which may be awarded.
