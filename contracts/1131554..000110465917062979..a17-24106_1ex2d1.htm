 **2.** **_The Share Purchase_**.

 



 

2.1 **Closing**. Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the closing
of the Share Purchase (the " **Closing** ") will take place (a) at the offices
of Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP, at One
Marina Park Drive, Suite 900, Boston, Massachusetts, at 10:00 a.m. (local
time) as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than two (2) business
days) following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (excluding conditions
that, by their terms, are to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waived on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of such conditions on the
Closing Date); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at least three (3) business days prior to the date on which the Closing
would otherwise occur, the Closing shall instead occur on the earlier to occur
of (i) a business day during the Marketing Period specified by Purchaser on no
fewer than three (3) business days written notice to Seller (it being
understood that such date may be conditioned on the simultaneous completion of
the Financing) and (ii) the second (2nd) business day following the final day
of the Marketing Period (subject, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses
(i) and (ii), to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waived on the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waiver of such
conditions on the Closing Date) as of the date determined pursuant to this
proviso); or (b) at such other time, date or place as agreed to in writing by
Purchaser and Seller. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " **Closing Date**."

 



 

2.2 **Purchase and Sale of Company Shares**. At the Closing, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions contained herein, (a) Seller will sell, convey,
transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser will purchase and
acquire from Seller, all of the issued and outstanding Company Shares, free
and clear of all Liens, and (b) as full and complete consideration for the
sale and transfer of all of the issued and outstanding Company Shares,
Purchaser shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Seller the Total Share Purchase
Consideration, paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
bank account designated in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Immediately
following the Closing, Seller will pay

 



      
 

 



 

$5 million to Purchaser as partial reimbursement of the out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Purchaser, Siris Capital Group, LLC and their respective
affiliates in connection with the execution of this Agreement, the Share
Purchase and any other Transactions.

 



 

2.3 **Net Cash Adjustment and Net Working Capital Adjustment**.

 



 

(a) The Company shall deliver the Closing Financial Certificate to Purchaser
not later than four (4) business days prior to the Closing Date. Following the
delivery of the Closing Financial Certificate and until two (2) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have a reasonable opportunity to
review and discuss with Seller the Closing Certificate. Seller will consider
Purchasers comments in good faith and shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to adjust the Closing Certificate as a result of such discussions.

 



 

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a written notice (the " **Purchaser Adjustment Notice** ")
setting forth Purchasers calculation of the Company Closing Cash, Company
Closing Debt and Company Closing Net Working Capital (the " **Purchase Price
Calculations** "), and the amount by which the Company Closing Cash, Company
Closing Debt and Company Closing Net Working Capital as calculated by
Purchaser is greater or less than the Company Closing Cash, Company Closing
Debt and Company Closing Net Working Capital as set forth in the Closing
Financial Certificate, in each case together with supporting documentation,
information and calculations. Any matters not expressly set forth in the
Notice of Objections shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller. If, for
any reason, Seller fails to deliver the Notice of Objection within the time
period required by Section 2.3(c), the amounts set forth in the Purchase Price
Calculations delivered by Purchaser to Seller shall be considered for all
purposes of this Agreement as being the Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Debt
and Final Net Working Capital.

 



 

(c) Seller may object to the calculation of the Company Closing Cash, Company
Closing Debt or Company Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Purchaser
Adjustment Notice by providing written notice of such objection to Purchaser
within thirty (30) days after Purchaser delivery of the Purchaser Adjustment
Notice (the " **Notice of Objection** "), together with supporting
documentation, information and calculations (including Sellers calculation of
the Company Closing Cash, Company Closing Debt and Company Closing Net Working
Capital).

 



 

(d) If Seller timely provides the Notice of Objection, then Purchaser and
Seller shall confer in good faith for a period of up to fifteen (15) business
days following Purchasers timely receipt of the Notice of Objection in an
attempt to resolve any disputed matter set forth in the Notice of Objection,
and any resolution by them shall be in writing and shall be final and binding.
Any such resolution shall be considered for all purposes of this Agreement as
being the Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Debt and Final Net Working
Capital.

 



 

(e) If, after the fifteen (15) business day period set forth in Section
2.3(d), Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve any matter set forth in the Notice
of Objection, then Purchaser and Seller shall engage a nationally recognized
auditing firm acceptable to both Purchaser and Seller, which firm shall, to
the maximum extent reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

practicable, be independent with respect to Purchaser and Seller (the "
**Reviewing Accountant** ") to review only the matters in the Notice of
Objection (including the supporting documentation, information and
calculations) that are still disputed by Purchaser and Seller and the Purchase
Price Calculations to the extent relevant thereto. After such review and a
review of Sellers relevant books and records, the Reviewing Accountant shall
promptly (and in any event within sixty (60) days following its engagement)
determine the resolution of such remaining disputed matters in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and shall set forth such determination in
reasonable detail in a written notice and deliver such notice to both parties,
which determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto (except
in the case of fraud or manifest error). The Reviewing Accountants
calculation of the Company Closing Cash, Company Closing Debt and Company
Closing Net Working Capital shall be, with respect to any specific discrepancy
or disagreement, no greater than the higher amount calculated by Purchaser or
Seller, as the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be (it being understood that the
calculations of the Company Closing Cash, Company Closing Debt and Company
Closing Net Working Capital set forth in the Purchaser Adjustment Notice and
the Notice of Objection may not thereafter be varied by Purchaser or Seller,
as applicable, in the dispute resolution process involving the Reviewing
Accountant). The Reviewing Accountants calculation of the Company Closing
Cash, Company Closing Debt and Company Closing Net Working Capital shall be
shall be considered for all purposes of this Agreement as being the Final
Closing Cash, Final Closing Debt and Final Net Working Capital. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Reviewing Accountant shall be borne by Purchaser, on
the one hand, and by Seller, on the other, based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amounts not awarded to each party bears to the total
amounts contested by such party.

 



 

(f) The " **Final Balance** " means the sum of the following:

 



 

(i) if the Final Net Cash Shortfall or the Final Net Cash Surplus, as
applicable, is less than the Closing Net Cash Shortfall or Closing Net Cash
Surplus, as applicable, such difference (expressed as a negative number);

 



 

(ii) if the Final Net Cash Shortfall or Final Net Cash Surplus, as applicable,
is greater than the Closing Net Cash Shortfall or Closing Net Cash Surplus, as
applicable, such difference (expressed as a positive number);

 



 

(iii) if the Final Net Working Capital Shortfall or the Final Net Working
Capital Surplus, as applicable, is less than the Closing Net Working Capital
Shortfall or Closing Net Working Capital Surplus, as applicable, such
difference (expressed as a negative number); and

 



 

(iv) if the Final Net Working Capital Shortfall or Final Net Working Capital
Surplus, as applicable, is greater than the Closing Net Working Capital
Shortfall or Closing Net Working Capital Surplus, as applicable, such
difference (expressed as a positive number).

 



 

(g) If the Final Balance is a negative number (the " **Final Negative Amount**
"), then Seller shall pay to Purchaser without any dispute by Seller, the full
amount of the Final Negative Amount within two (2) Business Days from when the
Final Balance is

 



      
 

 



 

determined in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.3_. If the Final
Balance is a positive number (the " **Final Positive Amount** "), then
Purchaser shall pay to Seller the Final Positive Amount within two (2)
Business Days from when the Final Balance is determined in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 2.3_. If either fails to pay in a timely manner the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 2.3(g), that party shall pay interest on
such amounts at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect from time to
time from the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. For
purposes of the calculations in Section 2.3(f), in the case of comparing two
negative numbers, "less than" shall result in a larger negative number.

 



 

(h) For clarity, the process set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be the
exclusive remedy of Purchaser for disputes related to calculation of the
Company Closing Cash, Company Closing Debt, Company Closing Net Working
Capital, the Closing Financial Certificate, the Purchaser Adjustment Notice,
the Notice of Objection and any amounts set forth therein, except in cases of
fraud.

 



 

2.4 **Withholding Rights**. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld, and timely paid over to the appropriate
Government Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

2.5 **Contingent Consideration**.

 



 

(a) Once Purchaser and its affiliates receive cash consideration from one or a
series of Liquidity Events in excess of the Initial Invested Equity, Purchaser
shall pay to Seller any such excess from such Liquidity Event or Liquidity
Events or future Liquidity Events (the " **Contingent Consideration** ");
_provided_ that in no event shall the Contingent Consideration payable
pursuant to this Section 2.5 be greater than twenty-five million dollars ($25
million) in the aggregate, as may be reduced by 10.3(b). In the event of a
Liquidity Event that is a business acquisition or combination transaction in
which Company Shares are converted into publicly-traded securities, upon
written request of Seller made on or following the date on which such
securities are freely transferrable by Purchaser (or its affiliates),
Purchaser will transfer to Seller, the Contingent Consideration then owed as a
result of such Liquidity Event (if previously not paid) in the form of such
securities in lieu of cash (valued by Purchaser by reference to the reported
closing trading price on the date prior to such transfer), provided it is then
legally and contractually permissible to do so in a private transfer that is
unregistered under applicable securities laws.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and Seller agree to treat (and cause their respective affiliates
to treat) any Contingent Consideration paid to Seller as an adjustment to the
Total Share Purchase Consideration paid by Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement for all Tax purposes.

 



      
 

 



 

 **3.** **_Representations and Warranties of the Company_**.

 



 

Except as disclosed in a document of even date herewith delivered by the
Company to Purchaser prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
referring by section or sub-section number to the representations and
warranties in this Agreement (the " **Disclosure Schedule** "), ( _provided_
that an item disclosed in any Section shall be deemed to have been disclosed
for each other Section of this Agreement to the extent the relevance of such
disclosure to such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure) and except as disclosed in the reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with, or
furnished by the Company to, the SEC and publicly available prior to the date
of this Agreement (but excluding any risk factor disclosure under the heading
"Risk Factors" and any disclosure of risks included or referenced in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer, or any other disclosures included in
any such report, schedule, form, statement or other document to the extent
they are precatory, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Seller and
the Company hereby represent and warrant to Purchaser as follows:

 



 

3.1 **Organization and Qualification; Company Subsidiaries**.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where such failure, individually or in the aggregate, would
not have, or would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate
list, as of the date of this Agreement, of the name and jurisdiction of
organization of each subsidiary of the Company (each a " **Company
Subsidiary** "). Each Company Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing
and, to the extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have, or would not be reasonably likely to
have, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity
or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity.

 



 

3.2 **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws**. The Company has heretofore
made available to Purchaser a complete and correct copy of the Certificate of
Incorporation and the Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, each as

Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents
are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is in violation of any of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation,
Bylaws or equivalent organizational documents.

 



 

3.3 **Capitalization**.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of one
thousand (1,000) Company Shares, all of which are issued and outstanding as of
the date of this Agreement. All issued and outstanding Company Shares are held
by Seller.

 



 

(b) All issued and outstanding Company Shares are validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable and are issued free of any preemptive rights created by the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any Contract to which the Company is
a party.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement there are no outstanding (i) options,
warrants or other rights, Contracts, arrangements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
issue or sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in (or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such equity interests),
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) shares of capital stock of or
other voting securities or ownership interests in the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (iii) restricted shares, restricted share units, stock
appreciation rights, performance shares, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any
capital stock or other voting securities (including any bonds, debentures,
notes or other indebtedness having voting rights or convertible into or
exchangeable for securities having voting rights) or ownership interests in
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) being referred to collectively as the " **Company Securities** ").

 



 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other Contracts to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of any capital stock
of, or other equity interest in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 



 

(e) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Company Shares or any other Company Securities or any
capital stock of any Company Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any
Company Subsidiary or any other person. Each outstanding share of capital
stock of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable and was issued free of any preemptive rights created
by the organizational documents of such Company Subsidiary or any Contract to
which such Company Subsidiary is a party, and each such share is owned by the
Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens or Contracts
or other limitations on the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys voting
rights. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Company Subsidiary are owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary,
except as disclosed on Section 3.3(e) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



      
 

 



 

3.4 **Authority Relative to this Agreement**. The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the " **Transactions** "). The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i)
such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

 



 

3.5 **No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents**.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, other than the consents described
in Section 3.5(b) and the consents listed in Section 3.5(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, (iii) conflict with or violate any U.S. or non-U.S. law, including
any statute, controlling common law, ordinance, regulation, rule, code,
executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or other order of a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction (" **Law** ") applicable to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iv) result in any breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become a default or breach) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material benefit under any
Company Material Contract or material Permit to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or to which any material property, right or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except,
with respect to clauses (ii)  (iv), for any such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Share Purchase or any other Transactions
or (y) be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, waiting period expiration or termination, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, except (i) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " **HSR Act** ") and under any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, and similar requirements in foreign countries
regarding antitrust

 



      
 

 



 

or competition matters and any associated consents, approvals, authorizations,
waiting period terminations, or permits, and (ii) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x)
prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Share
Purchase or any other Transactions or (y) be material to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

3.6 **Sufficiency of Assets; Title to Assets;**.

 



 

(a) On the Closing Date, the Owned Company Intellectual Property and other
Company Intellectual Property, other assets and properties of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries, Company Material Contracts, other Contracts of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries, Company Leased Real Property, Systems and
Permits, together with the services to be provided to Purchaser, the Company
or Company Subsidiaries by Seller under the Services Agreement (to the extent
services are derived from Support Assets), will constitute all of assets
necessary to conduct the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately following the Closing in the same manner, in all material
respects, as such business was conducted on the date of this Agreement and as
of the Prior Closing Date. Except for (i) certain general corporate or other
overhead services provided by the Seller or its subsidiaries to the Company
and any Company Subsidiary since the Prior Closing Date and (ii) the assets to
be used to provide the services to be provided to Purchaser, the Company or
Company Subsidiaries by Seller under the Services Agreement, Seller and its
subsidiaries (excluding the Company and any Company Subsidiary) do not, and,
immediately following the Closing, will not (x) own, license, lease or have
any right with respect to any asset, real property, Intellectual Property or
System, (y) be party to or have any right with respect to any Contract or (z)
receive any benefit under or have right with respect to any Permit, in each
case which are necessary to run the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case and in all material respects, as such business was
conducted on the date of this Agreement and as of the Prior Closing Date
(other than Support Assets).

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Disclosure Schedules, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, have good and legal or
beneficial ownership to, or valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under
contract to use, all the personal properties and assets reflected on the

reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject

termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Seller pursuant to, or result
in the loss of a material benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or
other instrument or obligation to which Seller is a party or by which Seller
or any property or asset of Seller is bound or affected, except, with respect
to clauses (ii)  (iv), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults

the Outside Date or otherwise prevent Seller from performing any of its
material obligations under this Agreement.

generally, and general equitable principles, whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of either Sponsor
under any term or condition of the Limited Guarantee.

without liability hereunder, but shall furnish only that portion of such
confidential and proprietary information that Seller is advised by legal
counsel it is legally required to disclose and shall exercise reasonable
efforts, at its sole cost and expense, to preserve the confidentiality of such
information.

Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that Purchaser may disclose, or may permit
disclosure of, such information (i) to its Representatives who have a need to
know such information and are informed of their obligation to hold such

any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted prior to or on the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Seller or the Company shall (i) promptly (and in any

the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the avoidance of doubt
any request for information or other inquiry which Seller or the Company would
reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and
attaching a copy of any such written Acquisition Proposal and (ii) keep
Purchaser reasonably informed on a timely basis of the status of, and any
material modification to, any such Acquisition Proposal, except (and solely to
the extent) such notification and/or disclosure is prohibited by the terms of
a confidentiality agreement to which Seller or the Company is a party as of
the date of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3 **Employee Benefits Matters**.

 



 

(a) If so directed by Purchaser in writing at least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Companys board of directors will adopt (and
will cause any other sponsor of the applicable Company Benefit Plan to adopt),
at least two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, resolutions
terminating any and all Company Benefit Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code,
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company
becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in
Section 414(b) of the Code) as Purchaser. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Purchaser, and the
Company shall provide Purchaser evidence that such resolutions have been
adopted by the board of directors of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any other applicable Company Benefit Plan sponsor, as
applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating any such 401(k) plans as Purchaser may reasonably request.

 



 

(b) If so directed by Purchaser in writing at least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, and provided that the Company s legally entitled to
act unilaterally, the Company shall notify (or coordinate with any other
applicable parties to notify) any Third Party involved in the administration
or operation of each applicable Company Benefit Plan set forth on Schedule
7.3(b) of the Disclosure Schedule Plan) of its intent to terminate any
Continuing Employees participation in such Company Benefit Plan. Such
termination shall occur as soon as administratively practicable subject to any
contractual obligations of the Company with respect to such Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(c) During the one (1)-year period immediately following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company and/or their respective
subsidiaries to provide

 



      
 

 



 

the Continuing Employees with substantially comparable (i) base salary and
target annual bonus opportunities as was provided to such Continuing Employee
prior to the Closing and (ii) with severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits to which such Continuing Employee would
have been entitled with respect to such termination under the Company Benefit
Plans that are severance policies of Seller, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or that are employment agreements covering Company Employees as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, which Company Benefit Plans
are set forth on Section 7.3(c)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule and have been
provided to Purchaser prior to the date of this Agreement, _provided_ that
this undertaking shall not obligate Purchaser to continue the employment of
such Continuing Employees for any period following the Closing, and such
Continuing Employees may be terminated by Purchaser at any time (except to the
extent otherwise restricted by Law and subject to any Company Benefit Plans
that are contractual arrangements between the Company and any individual
employee, as in effect on the date hereof and as set forth on Section
7.3(c)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule and have been provided to Purchaser
prior to the date of this Agreement). In addition, Purchaser will be
responsible for paying the Continuing Employees the 2017 bonus following year-
end in the ordinary course and in amounts consistent with what is accrued
immediately prior to Closing and incurred between the Closing Date and year-
end.

 



 

(d) Through December 31st of the year in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Company and/or their respective subsidiaries to
provide the Continuing Employees with the types and levels of employee
benefits (excluding cash and equity-based long-term incentive opportunities)
that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to the types and levels
of employee benefits (excluding cash and equity-based long-term incentive
opportunities) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date (such benefits to be provided pursuant to the " **Purchaser
Plans** ," which for the avoidance of doubt may include the Company Benefit
Plans, to the extent such Company Benefit Plans are assumed by Purchaser).

 



 

(e) For all purposes of the Purchaser Plans, including vesting, eligibility to
participate, vacation accrual and levels of benefits (but not benefit accruals
under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit plan of Purchaser or vesting
under any equity incentive plan) under any Purchaser Plan, Purchaser will
credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the
Company before the Closing, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that the
foregoing will not apply to the extent that its application would result in
any duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts, subject in each
case to receipt of any required consent of the applicable Purchaser Plan
provider, to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Purchaser Plans, (ii)
for purposes of each Purchaser Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Purchaser Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) for the plan year in which the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Purchaser Plan.

 



 

(f) Purchaser will cause the Company to, honor, in accordance with their terms
the executive agreements listed on Section 7.3(f) of the Disclosure Schedule
following the Closing.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any plan
or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Purchaser or any
of its subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company prior
to the Closing), or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment
to any of the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to
employees or other persons on, prior to or following the Closing. Nothing in
this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate any such plans or arrangements of Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries (including any Company Benefit Plan of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary).

 



 

7.4 **Notification of Certain Matters**. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made by the
Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that
the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a) would not reasonably be expected to

agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the

complied with by it under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2(b) would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied. Purchaser

representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained in this Agreement
becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Section
8.3(a) would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied; or (ii) any failure
of Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied with by
it under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.3(a)
would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied.

 



 

7.5 **Litigation**. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties
of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement or
the Share Purchase or any other Transactions. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser in writing of any Action

Subsidiaries or Seller and any of its affiliates, as the case may be, that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to any Section of this Agreement or that relate to the
consummation of the Transactions. The Company shall give Purchaser the
opportunity to participate at Purchasers expense in (but not control) the
defense or settlement of any claims against the Company or any of its
directors relating to this Agreement or the Transactions. Seller and the
Company shall not settle any litigation against the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or Seller relating to this Agreement or the Share Purchase without
the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, it being understood that if
such settlement would affect the Company or Company Subsidiaries following the
Closing (other than customary confidentiality provisions in settlement
agreements), Purchaser may instead withhold or condition its consent in its
sole discretion).

 



 

7.6 **Regulatory Approvals; Efforts**.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to (i) consummate
and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable
date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate
the Transactions.

 



 

(b) The parties shall provide or cause to be provided (including by their
"ultimate parent entities" as that term is defined in the HSR Act or any
similar term under any other Antitrust Laws) as promptly as practicable to any
Governmental Authority information and documents requested by such
Governmental Authority to permit consummation of the Transactions, including
(i) filing any notification and report form and related material required
under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five
(5) business days after the date hereof; (ii) filing any notification required
under any other Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than five (5) business days after the date hereof; and (iii) complying
with any "second request" for information under the HSR Act and any comparable
request under any other Antitrust Law. Purchaser shall, with the Sellers and
the Companys reasonable assistance, prepare and file any notification
required under any foreign Antitrust Law.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if and to the
extent necessary to avoid any impediment under any Antitrust Law to the
Closing on or before the Outside Date, the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain any consent, authorization, approval, order, waiting period
expiration or termination, or exemption by, any Governmental Authority,
necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing, and to prevent the entry,
enactment, or promulgation of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other
order, decree, or ruling that would adversely affect the ability of the
parties to consummate the Transaction, including by (i) defending through
litigation any claim asserted under the Antitrust Laws in any court with
respect to the Transactions by any Governmental Authority or other third
party; (ii) offering, proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such businesses, equity holdings, product lines or assets of
the Purchaser or the Company and/or their respective affiliates, and (iii)

 



       
 

 



 

otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Purchasers freedom of action with respect to one or more
businesses, investments, product lines, or assets of Purchaser or the Company
and/or their respective affiliates; provided, however, that Purchaser shall
not be required to take or agree or commit to take any action, including any
agreement to divest or restrict its freedom after the Closing Date with
respect to any businesses, product lines, or assets of the Company and its
respective affiliates, if such action, individually or in the aggregate, would
be reasonably likely to be materially adverse to Purchaser or its affiliates
or the Company or its affiliates (with materiality for purposes of this
provision measured in relation to the Company); provided, further, that any
action contemplated by this Section 7.7(c) shall be conditioned upon the
Closing occurring.

 



 

(d) Subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions or restrictions
required by Law or by any Governmental Authority, Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Seller and the Company, on the other, shall each (i) provide to the other
parties copies of all filings and submissions made by such Party (and its
advisers) and all substantive correspondence between it (or its advisors) and
any Governmental Authority or third party, relating to the Transactions; (ii)
permit authorized representatives of the other to attend any meeting,
communication, or conference with any Governmental Authority related to the
Transactions; and (iii) promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority or third party whose consent is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, the parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, redact or
otherwise limit their disclosures to the other parties (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company or other competitively
sensitive information, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or regulatory requirements, and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. The
parties may also designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to
the other parties under this Section 7.6 as "outside counsel only," in which
case such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only
to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.6 to the contrary, the parties
hereto acknowledge that Purchaser or its designee will control and direct, and
Seller and the Company shall cooperate reasonably, subject to applicable Law,
with such direction and control, regarding the filings (including where to
file), strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any), and related
proceedings contemplated by this Section 7.6, including for the avoidance of
doubt the marketing or sale of any part of the Companys businesses or assets
related thereto; provided, however, that Purchaser or its designee shall
consult in advance with Seller and the Company in good faith with regard to
such filings, strategies, processes, negotiation of settlements (if any), and
related proceedings, and shall take reasonable account of any suggestions,
arguments, or other input provided by Seller or the Company in making any
decisions regarding the same.

 



 

7.7 **Further Assurances**. Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of
another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do
and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably necessary for
effecting the

 



      
 

 



 

consummation of this Agreement and the Transactions. In addition, from and
after the Closing, with respect to any claims for indemnification or expense
advancement from a Covered Person (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement)
or Indemnified Party (as defined in the Prior Merger Agreement) contemplated
by Section 6.10 of the Prior Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to cause the DandO "tail" insurance policy contemplated by
said Section 6.10 to satisfy such claims; provided, that Seller agrees that
Seller is at all times responsible for such claims (subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth in said Section 6.10).

 



 

7.8 **Public Announcements.** No press release or public announcement,
statement or disclosure concerning the Share Purchase or any other Transaction
shall be issued by either party without the prior consent of the other party,
except as such release or announcement may be required by Law, including the
rules or regulations of any U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 



 

7.9 **Financing**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable to arrange and
obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions (including,
to the extent required, any "flex" provisions) described in the Commitment
Letters and the Debt Fee Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts
to:

 



 

(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters;

 



 

(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter (the " **Financing Agreements** ");

 



 

(iii) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period,
satisfy, or cause its respective Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis
(or, in each case, if reasonably required to obtain the Financing, seek the
waiver of), all conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letters, the Debt Fee Letter and Financing Agreements that are within its
control (including by paying any commitment fees or other fees or deposits
required by the Debt Fee Letter or any other fee letters relating to the Debt
Commitment Letter);

 



 

(iv) comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letters to the extent
the failure to comply with such obligations would materially adversely impact
the amount or timing of the Financing or the availability of the Financing
prior to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(v) if available sources of cash are not otherwise available to consummate the
Transactions, and provided that the Marketing Period has ended and that all of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied or
waived (other than those other conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to

 



      
 

 



 

such conditions being able to be satisfied on the Closing Date), enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letters.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any amendment, supplement,
termination, modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of, any
condition, remedy or other provision under any Commitment Letter, Debt Fee
Letter or Financing Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller if
such amendment, supplement, termination, modification, replacement or waiver
would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing from that contemplated
by the Commitment Letters delivered as of the date hereof to an amount that,
together with available cash or other funds of Purchaser and its subsidiaries,
would on the Closing Date be less than the amount required to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) impose any new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of any
portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any
portion of the Financing) less likely to occur in any material respect or
(iii) adversely affect in any material respect the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Financing Agreements (it being understood and agreed that, in any event,
Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller, amend the Debt Commitment Letter
to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement and amend the economic and other arrangements with respect to the
existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or
similar entities). Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller of any such
amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver and deliver a copy
thereof to Seller. Upon the effectiveness of any such amendment, supplement,
modification, replacement or waiver, references herein to "Debt Commitment
Letter", "Equity Commitment Letter" and "Commitment Letters", as applicable,
shall include and mean such documents as amended, supplemented, modified,
replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 7.9(b), and references to
"Debt Financing", "Equity Financing" and "Financing", as applicable, shall
include and mean the financing contemplated by the applicable Commitment
Letter as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in compliance
with this Section 7.9(b), as applicable.

 



 

(c) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent required,
any "flex" provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment
Letter shall be withdrawn, terminated, repudiated or rescinded for any reason,
Purchaser shall (i) promptly notify Seller and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the occurrence of such event, and to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative
sources (the " **Alternative Financing** ") on terms and conditions
(including, to the extent required, the flex provisions) not less favorable in
the aggregate to Purchaser than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(after taking into account any flex provisions) and in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with other sources of immediately available funds at the
Closing, to consummate the Transactions (or replace any unavailable portion of
the Debt Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter
(including any associated engagement letter and related Debt Fee Letter) with
respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Commitment
Letter** "), copies of which (redacted, in the case of any such Debt Fee
Letter, with respect to fees, pricing caps and other economic

 



      
 

 



 

terms that would not affect the amount, availability or conditionality of the
Alternative Financing) shall be promptly provided to Seller. In the event any
Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Commitment Letter is entered into
in accordance with this Section 7.9(c), references herein to (A) "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include and mean any New Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect, (B) "Commitment Letters" shall be deemed
to include and mean the Commitment Letters to the extent not superseded by a
New Commitment Letter, as the case may be, at the time in question and any New
Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (C) "Debt Financing" and
"Financing" shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and Commitment Letters, in each case, as modified pursuant
to the preceding clauses (A) and (B).

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall furnish Seller substantially final drafts (when available)
and true and complete executed (upon execution) copies of the Financing
Agreements, in each case, upon Sellers reasonable request. Purchaser shall
(i) give Seller prompt notice of any default or breach by any party to any of
the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements of which Purchaser has
knowledge, if such default or breach would result in a material delay of or
limit the availability of the Financing and (ii) otherwise keep Seller
reasonably informed of the status of Purchasers efforts to arrange the
Financing (or any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Purchaser shall give Seller prompt notice (A) of the receipt by
Purchaser of any written notice or other written communication, in each case
from any Lender with respect to (x) any default under or breach of any
provisions of the Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements by Purchaser or
any withdrawal, termination, repudiation or rescission of any of the
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements by any Lender party thereto or (y)
any material dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any of the
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements with respect to the obligation to
fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing
Date, in each case, that would make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) materially less
likely to occur or materially delay the availability of the Financing, and (B)
if at any time for any reason Purchaser believes that it will not be able to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources, contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements or will be unable to obtain Alternative Financing.
Purchaser shall promptly provide any information reasonably requested by
Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A) or (B) of the
immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision hereof, Purchaser shall not be required to provide or disclose any
information that Purchaser believes would jeopardize attorney-client privilege
of Purchaser or its subsidiaries or that is requested for purposes of
litigation.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Section 7.9 shall require, and in no event shall the
reasonable best efforts of Purchaser require, Purchaser to (i) seek the Equity
Financing from any source other than the Sponsors, or in any amount in excess
of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Fee Letter (including, to the extent required,
the flex provisions contained therein).

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the
Financing or any Alternative Financing is a condition to the Closing, and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate Transactions irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any Alternative
Financing, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in Article 8.

 



 

7.10 **Financing Cooperation**.

 



 

(a) Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to,

conditions to the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied and as is otherwise

include material nonpublic information about Seller, the Company, their
respective subsidiaries or their securities);

 



      
 

 



 

(v) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and the

its affiliates;

 



 

(ix) causing the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (A) to assist in the
preparation of, and to execute and deliver, any pledge and security documents,

responsibilities) of the Company with respect to solvency matters in the form
set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment Letter), in each case, subject to
the occurrence of the Closing, (B) to provide information required by, and

regulations including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither
Seller, the Company (except with respect to any authorization letter delivered
pursuant to clause (a)(iv) above) nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or enter into any binding agreement
or commitment or incur any other actual or potential liability or obligation

not subject to the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) no director, manager,
officer or employee of Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to deliver any certificate or take any other action pursuant to
Section 7.10 to the extent any such action would reasonably be expected to

and (iii) none of Seller, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any

effective no earlier than the Closing Date by any persons that shall remain or
will become officers or directors of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as of the Closing. Seller and the Company hereby consent to the
use of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries trademarks and logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such trademarks and
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely,
to harm or disparage the Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives
in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to Section 7.10(a).
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives, from and against any and
all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and
reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements, suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the
Financing or any Alternative Financing and any information supplied or
provided in connection therewith (except (i) to the extent suffered or
incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct or
material breach of this Agreement by Seller, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Representative thereof, in each case as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) with respect to any information
provided by Seller, the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with
satisfying the conditions set forth in paragraph 7 of Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letter). Notwithstanding anything contained herein or otherwise,
the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall not be required
to make any payment under this Section 7.10(c) prior to the earlier to occur
of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) In the event the Closing occurs after November 15, 2017 (as a result of a
material breach by Purchaser of its covenants under this Agreement, or as a
result of

 



      
 

 



 

delay by the Lenders that constitutes a breach by the Lenders or is related to
a breach by Purchaser of its covenants under this Agreement), Purchaser shall,
promptly upon request by Seller following Closing, reimburse Seller, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $5 million, for any amendment, consent, or
waiver fee that Seller is required to pay the lenders under the Credit
Agreement, dated as of January 19, 2017, among Seller, the lenders party
thereto, and Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent (as amended by
the First Amendment and Limited Waiver to Credit Agreement dated July 19,
2017, the " **Seller Credit Agreement** ") as consideration for such lenders
agreement to extend the Waiver Termination Date (as defined in the Seller
Credit Agreement) thereunder; provided, that, in no event shall the
reimbursement pursuant to this Section 7.10(d) be payable in the event that
Closing fails to occur, or is delayed as a result of delay in obtaining
regulatory approvals under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law.

 



 

7.11 **Tax Matters**.

 



 

(a) All state and local transfer, sales, filing, recordation, use, stamp,
registration or other similar Taxes and fees resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (" **Transfer Taxes** ") shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. The parties
shall cooperate to pay such Transfer Taxes when due and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes as
required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) In the case of any real property Taxes, personal property Taxes or any
similar ad valorem Taxes or other periodic Tax attributable to the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries that are in respect of any Taxable period commencing
on or before the Closing Date and that ends after the Closing Date (a "
**Straddle Period** " and such a Tax, " **Straddle Period Tax** "), any such
Straddle Period Taxes shall be prorated between Purchaser and Seller on a per
diem basis with Seller responsible for such Straddle Period Tax attributable
to the period ending on the Closing Date and Purchaser responsible for such
Straddle Period Tax attributable to the period commencing after the Closing
Date. Straddle Period Taxes shall be timely paid as provided in Section
7.11(d), and subject to Section 7.11(d), all Tax Returns with respect thereto
shall be filed, as provided by applicable Law. With respect to other Taxes of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are in respect of a Straddle
Period, the Taxes shall be allocated between the Purchaser and Seller based on
a closing of the books at the end of the Closing Date. The paying party shall
be entitled to prompt reimbursement from the non-paying party in accordance
with this Section 7.11(b).

 



 

(c) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with
past practice, and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date (a " **Pre-Closing Tax Period** " and such Tax
Returns, " **Pre-Closing Tax Returns** "). With respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Returns required to be filed after the Closing Date (other than consolidated,
combined, or unitary Tax Returns), Seller shall provide a final copy of such
Tax Return to Purchaser no less than twenty (20) calendar days (or as soon as
reasonably practicable in the case of non-income Tax Returns) prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions), along with the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return (except to
the extent such Taxes were either (i) included as a liability in the
calculation of Company Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Net Working Capital or (ii) remitted to Purchaser in accordance with its
indemnification rights set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement), and
Purchaser shall thereafter cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, to execute and timely file such Tax Returns and shall timely
remit the Taxes shown as due on such Pre-Closing Tax Return. Purchaser shall
not amend, or cause or permit the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
to amend, any Pre-Closing Tax Return of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). With respect to taxes
for which Seller is responsible pursuant to this Section 7.11(c), all refunds
or credits of such taxes, as well as all refunds or credits attributable to
Transaction Tax Deductions, received (or realized by way of a reduction of
taxes otherwise payable) by Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall be for the
account of Seller and shall promptly be paid by Purchaser to Seller (net of
any Taxes in respect of the receipt or accrual of such refund or credit).

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared any Tax Returns of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period (" **Straddle
Period Tax Returns** ") and shall provide copies of such Tax Returns to Seller
no less than twenty (20) calendar days (or as soon as reasonably practicable
in the case of non-income Tax Returns) prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (taking into account any applicable extensions). Seller shall have
the right to review and comment on such Straddle Period Tax Returns, and
Purchaser shall not unreasonably refuse to reflect in such Tax Returns any
comments requested by Seller with respect to such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall
not file such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of Seller, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however,
that in no event shall Purchaser be prevented from timely filing any such Tax
Return (taking into account any applicable extensions). Seller shall remit to
Purchaser the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns that are allocable to
Seller (as determined in accordance with Section 7.11(b)) (except to the
extent such Taxes were either (i) included as a liability in the calculation
of Company Closing Net Working Capital or (ii) remitted to Purchaser in
accordance with its indemnification rights set forth in Section 10.2 of this
Agreement). Purchaser shall thereafter cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to execute and timely file such Straddle Period Tax Returns and
shall timely remit the Taxes shown as due on such Straddle Period Tax Returns.
Purchaser shall not amend, or cause or permit the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to amend, any Straddle Period Tax Returns without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(e) Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly notify the other in writing upon
the receipt of notice from any Tax Authority of any pending or threatened
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding related to taxes (a " **Tax
Proceeding** ") of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period. Seller shall have the sole right to
control any Tax Proceeding with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller (1) shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed with respect to any such
Tax Proceeding that relates solely to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and (2) will not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining Purchasers prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), if such settlement, compromise
or abandonment would have a material adverse impact on or otherwise bind the
Purchaser or any of

 



      
 

 



 

its affiliates in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding with respect to the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , Purchaser (1) shall keep Seller reasonably informed with respect
to any such Tax Proceeding, (2) shall consult with Seller before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (3) shall permit
Seller to participate, at Sellers expense, in the conduct of such Tax
Proceeding, and (4) shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax
Proceeding without obtaining Sellers prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(f) To the extent relevant to the Company, each party shall (i) provide the
other with such assistance as may reasonably be required in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return and the conduct of any Tax Proceeding and
(ii) retain for the longer of the applicable statute of limitations or at
least six years following the Closing Date and provide the other with all
records or other information that may be relevant to the preparation of any
Tax Returns or the conduct of any Tax Proceeding.

 



 

(g) No elections will be made under Section 338(g) or Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state or local law)
with respect to the Share Purchase. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary will make any other elections on or after the Closing Date that
would be effective for any Pre-Closing Period.

 



 

(h) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a duly
executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date,
substantially in the form of the sample certification set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(B).

 



 

(i) All Tax sharing, allocation, or similar agreements or arrangements in
effect prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement, any such
agreement solely among the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any
indemnification provisions for Taxes contained in credit agreements, leases or
other commercial agreements the primary purposes of which do not relate to
Taxes), and all liabilities and obligations in connection thereto, between
Seller or any of its affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, shall cease and terminate as of the Closing Date as to all
past, present and future periods. After the Closing Date, no party shall have
any rights or obligations under any such agreements.

 



 

7.12 **Post-Closing Access to Books and Records**.

 



 

(a) After the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date,
upon receipt of reasonable prior notice, each party agrees to provide, or
cause to be provided, to each other, as soon as reasonably practicable after
written request therefor and at the requesting partys sole expense,
reasonable access during normal business hours, to the other partys employees
(without substantial disruption of employment) and to any books, records,
documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title
and other papers relating to the conduct of the businesses of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date (the " **Books and
Records** "), to the extent reasonably available and in the possession or
under the control of the other party that the requesting party reasonably
needs (i) to

 



       
 

 



 

comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting party (including under applicable securities Laws) by a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting party, (ii) for
use in any other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other proceeding, or
in order to satisfy Tax, audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or
other similar requirements; provided, that, if Seller or any of its
subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries post-Closing), on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, nothing herein shall require
either party to disclose any information within the scope, or related to the
subject matter, of such litigation (iii) in connection with the filing of any
Tax Return or election or any amended return or claim for refund, determining
a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or any Tax audit or
other Tax Proceeding, (iv) to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
or (v) in connection with any other matter requiring access to any such
employees, books, records, documents, files and correspondence of the other
party, solely to the extent necessary for Purchasers operation of the
businesses of the Company and Company Subsidiaries after Closing or Sellers
operation of its other businesses, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_
, that no party shall be required to provide access to or disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate any Law or agreement, or waive
any attorney-client or other similar privilege, and each party may redact
information regarding itself or its subsidiaries or otherwise not relating to
businesses of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, and, in the event such
provision of information could reasonably be expected to violate any Law or
agreement or waive any attorney-client or other similar privilege, the parties
shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence, provided,
further, Purchaser shall have no obligations pursuant to this Section 7.12
following a sale by Purchaser of its ownership interest in the Company Shares
(provided Purchaser has exercised commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
buyer of such Company Shares to assume such obligations).

 



 

(b) Any information owned by a party that is provided to a requesting party
pursuant to this Section 7.12 shall be deemed to remain the property of the
providing party. Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights of license
or otherwise in any such information.

 



 

7.13 **Insurance**. Purchaser acknowledges that the policies and insurance
coverage maintained by Seller for the benefit of the businesses of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries are part of the corporate insurance program
maintained by Seller, and such coverage will not be available or transferred
to Purchaser, except as provided for in the Services Agreement. From and after
the Closing Date, the Company and Company Subsidiaries shall cease to be
insured by Sellers corporate insurance policies or by any of its self-insured
programs; _provided_ , _however_ that to the extent permitted under the
applicable insurance programs (for clarity, excluding any self-insurance
programs), Purchaser shall continue to be insured under such insurance
programs for any claims related to pre-Closing occurrences and may request
that Seller make claims under such policies and programs with respect to
losses occurring (whether known or unknown) before the Closing Date to the
extent insurance programs in respect of such claims may be available, and
Seller shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with the tendering of such claims to the applicable insurers under
such insurance programs and shall provide Purchaser with the net proceeds they
realize with respect to such claims; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser
agrees to

 



      
 

 



 

reimburse upon the request of Seller any deductibles under the insurance
policies and programs resulting directly from such claims; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event that otherwise insured losses under a particular
insurance program attributable to the aforementioned claims by Purchaser and
attributable to other claims by Seller and its subsidiaries exceed the
coverage limit under such insurance program, then Purchaser and Seller shall
each be responsible for any uncovered losses on a pro rata basis (according to
the relative amounts of otherwise insured losses). Seller may, to be effective
at the Closing, amend any such corporate insurance policies in the manner it
deems appropriate to give effect to this Section 7.13; _provided_ that neither
Seller nor any of its affiliates may take any action that would reduce, modify
or eliminate any coverage, terms and conditions or policy limits to the
detriment of the Company under any insurance program (for clarity, excluding
any self-insurance program) presently available to the Company for any claims
related to pre-Closing occurrences. From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall be responsible for, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser
in, securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the
businesses of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, except as otherwise
provided in the Services Agreement. Purchaser covenants and agrees not to seek
to assert or to exercise any rights or claims of the businesses of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries under or in respect of any past or current corporate
insurance policy of Seller for post-Closing occurrences, except as otherwise
provided in the Services Agreement.

 



 

7.14 **Guarantees**.

 



 

(a) Purchaser recognizes that Seller and certain of its affiliates have
provided credit support to the Company and Company Subsidiaries pursuant to
guarantees, letters of credit, bonds, sureties and other credit support or
assurances provided by Seller or its affiliates in support of any obligation
of the businesses of the Company and Company Subsidiaries (the " **Business
Guarantees** ") set forth on Schedule 7.15 of the Disclosure Schedule and that
Seller may supplement Schedule 7.15 of the Disclosure Schedule from time to
time prior to Closing to include (at Sellers cost) any additional Business
Guarantees entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
from the respective beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Seller, on or before the Closing Date, valid and binding written releases

Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall be indemnified for all Damages
therefrom (including an amount equal to the De Minimis Threshold) (the " **Non
De Minimis Damages** "), but subject to any remaining amount of the Deductible
and (ii) the aggregate amount of Damages that are indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section 10.2(b)(i), as applicable, exceeds $4,000,000
(the " **Deductible** ") (provided that in the case of each of Section 3.6(a)
and Section 3.26 only, the Deductible shall be deemed to be $1,000,000
respectively), and once the Deductible has been reached, the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall be indemnified for all
Non De Minimis Damages in excess of the Deductible. None of the De Minimis
Threshold, the Deductible, or the Cap shall apply to Damages related to the
breach of any Company Fundamental Representations, Seller Fundamental
Representations, or any of the representations and warranties contained in
Section 3.15.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in Section 10.3(a) and this Section 10.3(b), no
Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification under Section 10.2(a)(i) or Section 10.2(b)(i) for an
aggregate amount of Damages exceeding $25 million (the " **Cap** ") in
connection with Damages related to the breach of any of the representations or
warranties of Seller, the Company or the Purchaser, respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Damages attributable to a breach
of Section 3.6(a) only, the maximum indemnification liability of Seller will
be $50 million (the " **Sufficiency Cap** ") (it being understood that the
Sufficiency Cap is available only with respect to breaches of Section 3.6(a),
and that recoveries under Section 10.2(a)(i) for breaches of all other
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company will not count
concurrently against the Sufficiency Cap but only against the Cap or the
Disclosure Cap, as applicable); _provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes of
the determination of whether there was a failure of Section 3.6(a) to be true
and correct, breaches with respect to Support Assets shall be disregarded
unless they are material in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the case of Damages attributable to a breach of Section 3.26 only, the maximum
indemnification liability of Seller will be $50 million (the " **Disclosure
Cap** ") (it being understood that the Disclosure Cap is available only with
respect to breaches of Section 3.26, and that recoveries under Section
10.2(a)(i) for breaches of all other representations and warranties of Seller
and the Company will not count concurrently against the Disclosure Cap but
only against the Cap or the Sufficiency Cap, as applicable). None of the Cap,

 



      
 

 



 

the Disclosure Cap or the Sufficiency Cap shall apply to any claim for
indemnification with respect to a breach of Company Fundamental
Representations, Seller Fundamental Representations or any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.15, which shall be
capped at the Total Share Purchase Consideration (the " **Fundamental
Representation Cap** "). The parties agree that any liability or
indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of Section 10.2(a)(i)
(other than a breach of Section 3.6(a) or Section 3.26) shall be payable by
Seller as follows: (x) first, up to $2 million in cash, (y) second, up to $23
million as a set off against Purchasers obligation to pay, if and when
payable, the Contingent Consideration, and (z) third, any remaining liability
or indemnification obligation, in cash. The parties agree that any liability
or indemnification obligation with respect to a breach of Section 3.6(a) or
Section 3.26 shall be payable by Seller in cash. For clarity, the maximum
indemnification liability of Seller under Section 10.2(a)(i) in all
circumstances shall be equal to the Fundamental Representation Cap.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts (including by seeking to recover for
Damages pursuant to existing insurance policies) to mitigate the amount of any
Damages after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to Damages pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)-(ii) or Section
10.2(b)(i)-(ii) (other than for intentional breaches of Section 10.2(a)(ii) or
Section 10.2(b)(ii)). Without limiting the foregoing, Damages shall be
calculated net of actual recoveries under existing insurance policies and
contractual indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case
calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves, deductibles,
premium adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums); _provided_ , that, in
the event that Purchaser Indemnified Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons
recover from Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, for any particular Damages
and thereafter recover for the same Damages pursuant to any existing insurance
policies and/or contractual indemnification or contribution provisions, then
the amount recovered pursuant to such existing insurance policies and/or
contractual indemnification or contribution provisions (up to the amount first
recovered from Seller or Purchaser, as applicable) shall be paid to Seller by
Purchaser or to Purchaser by Seller, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Damages pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)-(ii) or Section 10.2(b)(i)-(ii)
(other than for intentional breaches of Section 10.2(a)(ii) or Section
10.2(b)(ii)) shall include only actual losses and out-of-pocket expenses
incurred and shall exclude (i) special, exemplary or punitive Damages, (ii)
consequential or indirect damages that were not reasonably foreseeable, unless
in each case of (i) and (ii), awarded by an arbitrator or Governmental
Authority to a Third Party and paid to such Third Party by a Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, (iii) lost opportunities and
other similar speculative Damages, and (iv) diminution or reduction in value
damages premised upon application of a multiplier. In the event that
particular underlying facts constitute a breach of more than one of the
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement, then to the extent
the same indemnifiable Damages result from such multiple breaches, such
indemnifiable Damages may not be actually recovered more than one time by any
Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable,
without limiting any rights of a party to make claims under multiple
provisions hereunder. If and solely to the extent that an amount of Damages in
connection with an Indemnifiable Matter was already taken into account in
connection with calculation of the Total

 



      
 

 



 

Share Purchase Consideration or Final Net Working Capital, the same amount of
such Damages may not be recovered under this Article 10.

 



 

(e) For the purposes of the determination of (i) whether there was a failure
of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any particular
date and (ii) the existence or amount of any Damages in respect of any such
failure, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard or qualification
contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty shall
be disregarded (other than in instances where the word "Material" is used as
part of the capitalized defined terms "Company Material Contracts" and
"Material Adverse Effect"); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.17(a)(i), such standard
or qualification shall not be disregarded for purposes of the foregoing clause
(i). For the purposes of the determination of (i) whether there was a failure
of any representation or warranty contained in Section 3.15 to be true and
correct as of any particular date and (ii) the existence or amount of any
Damages in respect of any such failure of such representation in Section 3.15,
exceptions to any such representation or warranty contained in the Disclosure
Schedule shall be disregarded.

 



 

(f) To the extent a Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person
actually realizes any net Tax Benefits or incurs a net Tax Cost as a result of
the payment or incurrence of any Damages or the receipt or accrual of any
indemnity payments in respect of such Damages, respectively, the amount of
Damages for which indemnification is provided hereunder shall be (i) increased
to take account of such net Tax Cost arising from (and that would not have
arisen but for) the receipt or accrual of the indemnity payment hereunder
(grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of such net
Tax Benefits actually realized in cash or applied against cash Taxes payable
arising from (and that would not have arisen but for) the payment or
incurrence of any such Damages. In furtherance of (and without duplication of)
clause (ii) above, to the extent that the claim with respect to which an
indemnity obligation arises has not given rise to an actual net Tax Benefit in
a prior year or in the year in which the indemnity payment is to be made, but
gives rise to an actual net Tax Benefit payable with respect to the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, in any of the
four tax years following the payment or incurrence of such Damages, the
Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable,
shall pay to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, an amount equal to the net
Tax Benefit within twenty (20) business days after such benefit is actually
received in cash or is applied against cash Taxes payable if such benefit is
actually realized after the indemnity payment is made. For this purpose, a
Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall be deemed to
actually realize a net tax benefit (" **Tax Benefit** ") or a net Tax Cost ("
**Tax Cost** "), if, and to the extent that, such a Purchaser Indemnified
Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons actual Liability for Taxes (after
giving effect to any alternative minimum or similar Tax), calculated by
excluding any Tax items attributed to the payment or incurrence of the Damages
or the receipt or accrual of the indemnity payment in respect of such Damages,
is reduced by way of a reduction of Taxes paid or increase in a refund of
Taxes actually received or applied against other Taxes due or is increased by
way of an increase of Taxes paid or reduction in a refund of Taxes or credits
applied against Taxes due, respectively, in each case, determined on a "with
and without basis".

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of Seller and
the Company is not making and shall not be construed to have made, and Seller
shall

 



      
 

 



 

not have any liability or indemnification obligation with respect to, any
representation or warranty as to the amount or availability of any net
operating losses, Tax credits, or other Tax attribute. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Seller shall not have any liability or
indemnification obligation (i) for any Taxes of the Company or Company
Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Closing Date (other than (1) Taxes arising from a breach of any of
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.15(e), 3.15(f), or
3.15(g) and (2) Taxes arising as a result of any breach of or default in
connection with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company and
Seller in this Agreement to be performed), (ii) for any Taxes of the Company
or Company Subsidiaries resulting from any action or transaction outside of
the ordinary course of business taken by Purchaser after the Closing on the
Closing Date, (iii) the ability of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
affiliates to utilize any Tax asset or attribute (e.g., net operating loss
carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) in any Taxable period or portion
thereof (including any Straddle Period) beginning on or after the Closing
Date, (iv) resulting from an amendment of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries Tax Returns unless such amendment (A) is the result of a breach
or inaccuracy of the representations contained in Section 3.15 or (B) is in
connection with a "closing agreement" (within the meaning of Section 7121 of
the Code or any other analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law)
entered into in connection with a Tax Proceeding relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period, or (v) for any Taxes to the extent such Taxes
were included as a liability in the calculation of Company Closing Net Working
Capital.

 



 

(h) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements.

 



 

(i) Following the Closing, (i) this Article 10 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy for recovery of money Damages by the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons and Seller Indemnified Persons for all Seller Indemnifiable Matters
and Purchaser Indemnifiable Matters, as applicable, (ii) all applicable
statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for
Seller Indemnifiable Matters and Purchaser Indemnifiable Matters shall be
shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival periods expressly set
forth herein and (iii) the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and Seller
Indemnified Persons irrevocably waive any and all rights they may have to make
claims against Seller and Purchaser, as applicable, under statutory and common
law, other than claims for fraud, as a result of any Damages and any and all
other damages or losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Persons and
Seller Indemnified Persons with respect to the Seller Indemnifiable Matters
and Purchaser Indemnifiable Matters, as applicable, whether or not in excess
of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this Article 10
(it being understood that nothing in this Section 10.3(i) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall affect the parties rights (x) to specific performance or
other similar non-monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants

 



      
 

 



 

referred to in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing or (y)
pursuant to _Section 2.3_). Purchaser and Seller hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission with respect to the Transactions.

 



 

10.4 **Notice of Claims**.

 



 

(a) As used herein, the term " **Claim** " means a claim for indemnification
of any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person for Damages
under this Article 10. Purchaser or Seller may give notice of a Claim under
this Agreement, whether for its own Damages or for Damages incurred by any
other Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as
applicable, and Purchaser or Seller shall give written notice of a Claim
executed by an officer of Purchaser or Seller, as applicable (a " **Notice of
Claim** "), to Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, after Purchaser or Seller
becomes aware of the existence of any actual or potential claim by an
Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, for
indemnification from Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, under this Article
10, arising out of or resulting from (i) any Seller Indemnifiable Matter or
Purchaser Indemnifiable Matter or (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in
writing, against any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified
Person, as applicable, of a claim, demand or Action brought by a Third Party
against any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as
applicable (in each such case, a " **Third Party Claim** ") that is based on,
arises out of or relates to any Seller Indemnifiable Matter or Purchaser
Indemnifiable Matter.

 



 

(b) The period during which claims may be initiated (the " **Claims Period**
") for indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from: (i)
failure of any representation or warranty shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at the time of expiration of such representation or warranty set
forth in Section 10.1; (ii) breach of or default in connection with any of the
covenants or agreements to be performed prior to the Closing shall commence at
the Closing and terminate at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 12 month
anniversary of the Closing Date; and (iii) fraud, Excluded Liabilities and
Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 



 

(c) Each Notice of Claim given pursuant to this Section 10.4 shall contain the
following information:

 



 

(i) that a Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person has
incurred, paid or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it will incur, pay
or sustain, Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim
(which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a Third Party in an
action brought against any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified
Person, as applicable, based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise
to liability for Damages to such Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, under this Article 10); and

 



 

(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable), of the facts, circumstances
or events giving rise to such Damages based on Purchasers or Sellers, as
applicable, good faith belief thereof, including (x) the basis for such
anticipated liability and the nature of the breach to which

 



      
 

 



 

such Damages are related, (y) the identity of any Third Party claimant and (z)
copies of any formal demand or complaint from any Third Party claimant; and

 



 

(iii) a description and status of Purchasers or Sellers, as applicable,
claims for recovery of such Damages pursuant to its insurance policies

 



 

(d) No delay on the part of Purchaser or Seller in giving Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, a Notice of Claim shall relieve Seller or Purchaser, as
applicable, from any of its obligations under this Article 10 unless (and then
only to the extent that) Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, is materially
prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Damages for which Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, is obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons or Seller Indemnified Persons, as applicable.

 



 

10.5 **Defense of Third Party Claims**. Any Third Party Claim shall be subject
to the following procedures:

 



 

(a) In the event that any Third Party Claim shall be commenced, the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall promptly
cause written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim to be
forwarded to the Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, and the Seller or
Purchaser will have the right to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
at its sole cost and expense with reputable legal counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person,
as applicable, by delivering written notice of such election to the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, within ten
(10) business days after receipt of the Notice of Claim describing such Third
Party Claim. If Seller or Purchaser assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim in accordance with this subsection (a), then:

 



 

(i) Seller or Purchaser shall keep the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, informed of all material developments
relating to such Third Party Claim. The Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall have the right to receive copies of
all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to such Third Party
Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not waive any
privilege.

 



 

(ii) The Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as
applicable, may retain separate co-counsel and participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to such Third
Party Claim at its own cost and expense, and shall be entitled to reasonably
consult with Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, regarding the defense of such
Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to such Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(iii) Seller or Purchaser shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, unless (A) such judgment, settlement or
compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability with respect
to the claim in favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, or (B) the sole relief provided in
connection with such

 



      
 

 



 

judgment, settlement or compromise is monetary damages that are paid in full
by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, or any other relief that is enforceable
only against Seller or Purchaser, as applicable.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller or Purchaser shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim (unless the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, agrees
otherwise in writing) in the event:

 



 

(i) the Third Party Claim involves an injunction or other equitable relief;

 



 

(ii) Damages sought under such Third Party Claim (together with Damages sought
under any other Claims then pending or in dispute) would reasonably be
expected to not be covered by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, therefor
under the limitations set forth in Section 10.3(b); or

 



 

(iii) outside legal counsel to the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, reasonably determines that the legal
counsel chosen by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, has a conflict of
interest in representing the interests of the Purchaser Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable.

 



 

(c) In the event that Seller or Purchaser declines to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days of receiving a Notice of Claim,
or is not entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim according
to subsection (b) above, then the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, will have the right to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing (which reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel shall constitute Damages to which Seller or
Purchaser, as applicable, is responsible if the Claim underlying such Third
Party Claim is a Claim for which the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, is entitled to indemnification hereunder;
_provided_ that Seller or Purchaser shall not be required to pay for more than
one such counsel (plus any appropriate local counsel). If the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with this subsection (c), then:

 



 

(i) The Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall keep
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, informed of all material developments
relating to such Third Party Claim. Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall
have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications
with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such
documents does not waive any privilege.

 



 

(ii) Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, may retain separate co-counsel and
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim or settlement
negotiations with respect to such Third Party Claim at its own cost and
expense, and shall be entitled to reasonably consult with the Purchaser
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified person, as applicable, with respect
to the defense of such Third Party Claim or settlement negotiations with
respect to such Third Party Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) The Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise of such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed (it being understood that it shall be
reasonable to withhold such consent where Seller or Purchaser, as applicable,
believes in good faith that there is not an underlying basis for
indemnification with respect to such settlement)), unless (1) such judgment,
settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability
with respect to the claim in favor of the Purchaser Indemnified Person or
Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, or (2) the Purchaser Indemnified
Person or Seller Indemnified Person stipulates in writing that there are no
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification under this Article 10 in
connection with such judgment, settlement or compromise.

 



 

(d) Purchaser, Seller, the Purchaser Indemnified Person and the Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate (and cause their respective legal counsel to cooperate) in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by (i)
furnishing copies of documents, records or other information reasonably
requested by the other party and (ii) providing access to employees whose
assistance, testimony or presence is reasonably necessary to assist in the
evaluation and defense of such Third Party Claim (provided that any such
access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business activities of such
party).

 



 

10.6 **Resolution of Notice of Claim**. Each Notice of Claim shall be resolved
as follows:

 



 

(a) If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim is received by Seller or
Purchaser, Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, does not contest such Notice of
Claim in writing to Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, as provided in Section
10.6(b), Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be conclusively deemed to
have consented to the recovery by the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, of the full amount of Damages specified in
the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article 10.

 



 

(b) If Seller or Purchaser gives Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, written
notice contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a " **Contested
Claim** ") within the 30 day period specified in Section 10.6(a), then, the
parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of the indemnification claims that comprise the
Damages (or the portion of the Damages that are the subject of the Contested
Claim). If Seller and Purchaser should so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both such parties. In the
absence of such a written settlement agreement within 60 days following
receipt by Purchaser or Seller of the written notice from Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Purchaser and Seller,
either Seller or Purchaser make seek resolution by binding litigation in
accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 10.6(c); _provided_ that
Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented to the recovery by the Purchaser Indemnified Person or Seller
Indemnified Person, as applicable, of the full amount of Damages specified in
any portion of a Notice of Claim that is not a Contested Claim.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Either Purchaser or Seller may bring suit in the venue set forth in
Section 11.6(b) to resolve the Contested Claim. Judgment upon any award
rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

(d) Seller shall be entitled to refer to an archival copy of the electronic
data room maintained by Seller in connection with the Transactions for
purposes of administering Claims and exercising its rights hereunder;
_provided_ , that, Seller shall treat confidentially and not use or disclose
any nonpublic information from or about the Company and Company Subsidiaries
or their respective successors and assigns (if any) to anyone (except to
Sellers affiliates, employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or
authorized representatives strictly on a need to know basis for the above-
stated purpose, in each case who agree to treat such information
confidentially.

 



 

10.7 **Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. Purchaser and Seller agree to
treat (and cause their affiliates to treat) any payment received pursuant to
this Article 10 as adjustments to the Total Share Purchase Consideration for
all tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

 **11.** **_General Provisions_**.

Purchaser (and following the Closing Date, the Company) may at any time, and
without the consent of any other person or party, unilaterally grant a
security interest in, and assign for collateral security purposes, its rights
and interests hereunder to the Lenders (or their agent) providing Debt
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive documentation
with respect thereto. Except for the representations and warranties contained
in Article 3 and Article 4 (and the certificates contemplated by Section
8.2(a)-(b)), Purchaser acknowledges that neither Seller, the Company nor any
person on behalf of Seller or the Company makes, and neither Purchaser nor any
person on its behalf relies upon, any other express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to Seller, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to
Purchaser in connection with the Transactions; provided, that, nothing in this
sentence only shall relieve Sellers liability for fraud. In addition to the
foregoing, Purchaser hereby acknowledges that neither Seller, the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making, and neither
Purchaser nor any person on its behalf is relying upon, any representation or
warranty or has or shall have any liability in connection with the
Transactions (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise,
including without limitation on any legal theory asserting fraud or
intentional misrepresentation) with respect to estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans or cost-related plans that are forward-looking in
nature or other forward-looking information (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as may be
expressly set forth in Article 3 and Article 4 of this Agreement. Except for
the representations and warranties contained in Article 5 (and the
certificates contemplated by Section 8.3(b)), Seller and Company acknowledge
that Purchaser is not making, and neither Seller, the Company nor any person
on their behalf relies upon, any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Purchaser or with respect to any other information
made available to the Company or Seller in connection with the Transactions;
provided, that, nothing in this sentence only shall relieve Purchasers
liability for fraud or shall apply to the Equity Commitment Letter or Limited
Guarantee. The Company and Seller hereby acknowledge that neither the
Purchaser nor any of its respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty or has or shall
have any liability (whether pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise,
including without limitation on any legal theory asserting fraud or
intentional misrepresentation) with respect to estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans or cost-related plans that are forward-looking in
nature or other forward-looking information (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-
looking information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as may be
expressly set forth in Article 5 of this Agreement; provided, that, nothing in
this sentence only shall apply to the Equity Commitment Letter or Limited
Guarantee.

 



 

11.4 **Parties in Interest**. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 9.3, this Section 11.4,
Section 11.5(d), the proviso in Section 11.6(a), the last sentence of Section
11.6(b), Section 11.7 and the final sentence of Section 11.9 are intended to
be for the

 



      
 

 



 

benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Lender Related Parties, and the
provisions of Section 11.12 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Non-Party Affiliates.

 



 

11.5 **Specific Performance**.

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 11.5(c), parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or
equity, and nothing herein shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right
to injunctive relief or specific performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, including with respect to the Purchaser Termination Fee, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one
remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of
Seller to cause Purchaser to cause the Share Purchase and the other
Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement only in accordance with the express terms of Section
11.5(c) below. Each of parties to this Agreement further agrees that no other
party or any other person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy referred to in this Section 11.5, and each of the parties to this
Agreement irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Subject to
Section 11.5(c), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees not to raise any
objections to (i) the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by Seller or the Company, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the
other hand and (ii) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, on the basis that (A) either party
has an adequate remedy at Law or (B) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at equity or Law, or any similar grounds.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 11.5(a)-(b), it is explicitly agreed
that the right of Seller to obtain an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Purchasers obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Total Share Purchase
Amount payable in the Share Purchase and Purchasers obligations to cause the
Closing to occur and to effect the consummation of the Share Purchase and
other Transactions (but not the right of Seller to obtain such injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall
be subject to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all
of the conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied by the
date the Closing is required to have occurred in accordance with Section 2.1
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing Date, _provided_ that such conditions would be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing were on such date), (ii) Purchaser fails to complete
the Share Purchase by the date the Closing is required to have occurred in
accordance with Section 2.1, (iii) the Debt Financing

 



      
 

 



 

provided for by the Debt Commitment Letter has been funded in accordance with
the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at
the Closing Date, if the Equity Financing is funded at such time and (iv)
Seller has irrevocably confirmed by written notice that if the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that
are within its control to cause the consummation of the Transactions and the
Closing to occur. In no event shall the Company be entitled to both a grant of
specific performance to cause the Share Purchase to be consummated and payment
of the Purchaser Termination Fee.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders under the Debt Commitment
Letter and any Financing Agreement and the rights of Purchaser under the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Financing Agreement, each of Seller and the Company
acknowledges and agrees that no Lender Related Party shall have any liability
to Seller or the Company (or any of their respective Representatives) in
connection with this Agreement or any Transactions if such Lender Related
Party breaches or fails to perform (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) any of its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter and each of Seller and the Company (on behalf of itself and its
Representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims against each Lender
Related Party in connection with this Agreement and the Debt Financing,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and each of
Seller and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Representatives) agrees
not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate)
any action or proceeding against any Lender Related Party in connection with
this Agreement or any Transaction (including any action or proceeding relating
to the Debt Financing). In no event shall Seller or the Company (or any of
their respective Representatives) be entitled to directly seek the remedy of
specific performance of this Agreement against any Lender Related Party.

 



 

11.6 **Governing Law**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware without regard to any applicable conflicts of law;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes involving the
Lender Related Parties (except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the applicable
Laws of the State of New York without giving regard to conflicts or choice of
law principles that would result in the application of any Law other than the
Law of the State of New York.

 



 

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery, or if no such
state court has proper jurisdiction, then the Federal courts located in the
State of Delaware (collectively, the " **Delaware Courts** "). The parties
hereto hereby (i) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Courts for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any party hereto, (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named courts, (iii) agree to not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than the Delaware Courts and

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures
set forth in Section 11.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties agree that it will not bring, or support the
bringing of, any proceeding, claim or counterclaim, whether in law or in
equity, whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, against the
Lender Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
County of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



 

11.7 **Waiver of Jury Trial**. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING THE
DEBT FINANCING AND THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER AND ANY ACTION AGAINST ANY
LENDER RELATED PARTY). Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver, (b) understands and has
considered the implications of such waiver, (c) makes such waiver voluntarily
and (d) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 11.7.

action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any

or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension
or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party or parties to be bound thereby.

 



 

11.11 **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

11.12 **Non-Recourse**. Except as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Limited Guarantee, and in those instances, only to those entities
explicitly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited
Guarantee, as the case may be, (a) all claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of

this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are expressly

in connection with or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance, non-performance, interpretation, termination, enforcement,
construction or execution or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than any liability of any Lender Related Party to Purchaser or any of
their affiliates pursuant to or in connection with any agreement by or between
them) and each party hereto waive and releases all such Damages, claims and
obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates (except that none of

obligations arising pursuant to or in connection with any agreement by or
between them).
