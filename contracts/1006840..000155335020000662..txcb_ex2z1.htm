8.7 _Schedules; Knowledge _. The CAYMAN Company Schedules and Cang Bao
Schedules referred to herein and delivered pursuant to and attached to this
Agreement (collectively, " _Schedules_ ") are integral parts of this
Agreement. Nothing in a Schedule shall be deemed adequate to disclose an
exception to a representation or warranty made herein, unless the Schedule
identifies the exception with reasonable particularity and describes the
relevant facts in reasonable detail, including by cross-reference to another
Schedule. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such
information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material to
the business of CAYMAN Company or Cang Bao, as the case may be, or is outside
the ordinary course of business. CAYMAN Company is responsible for preparing
the CAYMAN Company Schedules and Cang Bao is responsible for preparing the
Cang Bao Schedules. Each of the CAYMAN Company Schedules and the Cang Bao
Schedules will be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and
lettered paragraphs contained in this Agreement, and the disclosure in any
such numbered and lettered section of the CAYMAN Company Schedules or the Cang
Bao Schedules, as the case may be, shall qualify and shall be deemed to
qualify such other paragraphs in this Agreement to the extent such
qualification is reasonably apparent regardless of the absence of any express
cross-reference to such other paragraph. Each party is presumed to have full
knowledge of all information set forth in the other partys Schedules
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

8.8 _Third Party Beneficiaries _. This contract is strictly between and
among Cang Bao, CAYMAN Company and the CAYMAN Company Shareholders, and,

the CAYMAN Company Shareholders), employee, agent, independent contractor or
any other person or entity shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.9 _Expenses _. Subject to _Articles VI and VII _above, whether or
not the Exchange is consummated, each of Cang Bao, the CAYMAN Company
Shareholders and CAYMAN Company will bear their own respective expenses,
including legal, accounting and professional fees, incurred in connection with
the Exchange or any of the other contemplated Transactions.

 



 

8.10 _Entire Agreement _. This Agreement, together with the Schedules and
any certificate or agreements delivered on the Closing Date, represents the
entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter thereof
and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations, written
or oral, with respect to such subject matter.

Agreement, the representations, warranties, and covenants of the respective
parties shall survive the Closing Date and the consummation of Transactions
for a period of two (2) years.

 



 

8.12 _Counterparts _. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which taken
together shall be but a single instrument.

 



 

8.13 _Amendment or Waiver _. Every right and remedy provided herein
shall be cumulative with every other right and remedy, whether conferred
herein, at law, or in equity, and may be enforced concurrently herewith, and
no waiver by any party of the performance of any obligation by the other
parties shall be construed as a waiver or any other default then, theretofore,
or thereafter occurring or existing. At any time prior to the Closing Date,
this Agreement may by amended by a writing signed by all parties hereto, with
respect to any of the terms contained herein, and any term or condition of
this Agreement may be waived or the time for performance may be extended by a
writing signed by the party or parties for whose benefit the provision is
intended.

take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective this Agreement and the contemplated
Transactions.

 



 

8.15 _References _. References to Sections, Articles, Schedules or
Exhibits in this Agreement shall be to Sections, Articles, Schedules or
