Purchase Price Adjustment Amount at any time after receipt of the Purchasers
calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. If the Seller does
not send such an acceptance, and unless the Seller delivers to the Purchaser
written notice setting forth any specific items in the Purchasers calculation
of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount disputed by the Seller (each,
a "Disputed Item") and a written statement (a "Notice of Objection") setting
forth the Sellers calculation of each such Disputed Item on or prior to
the 60th day after the Sellers receipt of the Final Working Capital
Worksheet, the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Interim PDH Expenditures
and the Final Debt (such period, the "Objection Period"), the Seller will be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Purchasers calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and such agreement will be final, binding and
conclusive. Any items in the Purchasers calculation of the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount to which the Seller has not given a Notice of
Objection within the Objection Period will be deemed to have been agreed upon
by the Parties. If the Seller so notifies the Purchaser of its objections to
the Purchasers calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
within the Objection Period, the Seller and the Purchaser shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the Disputed Items
within 30 days following such notice (the "Resolution Period"). Any resolution
by the Seller and the Purchaser during the Resolution Period as to any
Disputed Items will be final, binding and conclusive.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If the Seller and the Purchaser do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end
of the Resolution Period, then the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit all
unresolved Disputed Items to the firm of KPMG, or such other independent,
nationally recognized accounting firm to which the Parties may agree in
writing (the "Accounting Firm") as soon as practicable, and not later than
seven days, following the expiration of the Resolution Period. In such event,
the Seller and the Purchaser shall each submit to the Accounting Firm its
calculation of the Final  

---|---|--- 
 



18 supporting documentation as it deems appropriate. The Accounting Firm shall
consider only those items and amounts in the Sellers and the Purchasers
respective calculations of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount that are
identified as Disputed Items. The scope of the Disputed Items to be resolved
by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to correcting mathematical errors and
determining whether the items and amounts in dispute were determined in
compliance with this _Section 2.6_ and _Exhibit 2.6_, and the Accounting
Firm is not to make any other determination. In resolving any Disputed Item,
the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by either Party. The Accounting Firm shall be
required to resolve such dispute within 30 days after the date on which the
Accounting Firm receives the calculations of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount submitted by the Seller and the Purchaser. The determination
of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Parties and
shall not be subject to appeal or further review absent manifest error. The
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be shared equally by the
Parties. The Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.6_ shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving disputes regarding
the determination of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. 
---|--- 
 



     | (d) | Within five Business Days after the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6:_ 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price Amount, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated by the Seller, an
amount equal to the excess of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount over
the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount, then the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by the
Purchaser an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount over the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.6_ is equal to the Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount, neither the Purchaser nor the Seller shall have any
further obligation under this _Section 2.6_. 
---|---|--- 
 



19 of the Target Companies receive any IEEP Credits on or after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall, until the end of the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, pay to Seller the full amount of any such IEEP Credits received within
30 days of the receipt thereof until the aggregate amount of such payments in
respect of such IEEP Credits pursuant to this _Section 2.6(e)_ is equal to
the IEEP Credit Amount and, thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to retain
any further IEEP Credit received by Purchaser or any Combined Target Company. 
---|---|--- 



   2.7 | Interest Accrues on Amounts Owing. 
---|--- 

Any amount owing to a Party by the other Party pursuant to any provision
of this _ARTICLE 2_ after Closing and remaining unpaid shall bear interest
calculated daily and compounded monthly, from the day such amount was due to
be paid until the day such amount was paid, at the Prime Rate plus 1% per
annum regardless of whether such Party has given the other Party prior notice
of the accrual of interest hereunder. For the purposes of this _Section 2.7_,
amounts withheld and paid to the Closing Escrow Agent as provided in 
_Sections 2.9_ and _2.10_ shall be deemed to not be amounts owing by the
Purchaser to the Seller that remain unpaid after Closing.



   2.8 | Allocation of Purchase Price. 
---|--- 

The Seller and the Purchaser shall allocate the Purchase Price among
the Purchased Shares as set out in _Exhibit 2.8_. The Seller and the
Purchaser agree that the values so attributed to the Purchased Shares are the
respective fair market values thereof, and the Seller and the Purchaser shall
file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the foregoing allocations.
If any Governmental Authority does not agree with the allocation of the
Purchase Price agreed to by the Parties in accordance with the foregoing, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts and good faith to agree
upon different allocations acceptable to the relevant Governmental Authority
and, if the Parties are able to agree, they shall thereafter amend the
allocations and their Tax Returns accordingly; provided however that nothing
in this _Section 2.8_ shall be construed as to require either Party to
commence or participate in any litigation or administrative process
challenging the determination so made by any relevant Governmental
Authority.

or before the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from
the TCP Purchase Price an amount equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the TCP

---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Where the Purchaser has withheld the Withholding Amount and
the Seller delivers to the Purchaser, after the Closing Date, but on or before
28th day of the month following the Closing Date (the "Remittance Date"),

disposition that is equal to (or greater than) the TCP Purchase Price, then

Amount, and the Parties shall direct the Closing Escrow Agent to disburse
such amount to the Seller; or

Canada on behalf of the Purchaser (and the amount so remitted shall be
credited as a payment of the TCP Purchase Price under this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Where the Purchaser has withheld the Withholding Amount and
no Clearance Certificate has been delivered to the Purchaser by the Seller on
or before the Remittance Date in accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_,

General for Canada if, on or before the Remittance Date: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Seller delivers to the Purchaser a comfort letter issued
by the CRA deferring the remittance obligations of the Purchaser under section

Purchasers remittance obligations under section 116 of the Tax Act, and (B)
the resulting deferred Remittance Date,

     |  | whereupon the Withholding Amount shall be dealt with by the
Closing Escrow Agent in the manner described in _Sections 2.9(c)_ and
_2.9(d)_ applied _mutatis mutandis_ having regard to such deferred Remittance
Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Any amount withheld from the TCP Purchase Price by the
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ shall be paid to the Closing Escrow

_Section 2.9(d)_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
where all or a portion of the Withholding Amount is remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities in accordance with the provision of this
_Section 2.9_, such amounts so remitted shall be deemed to have been paid by
the Purchaser and received by the Seller as at the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (g) | For greater certainty, the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that any amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section 2.9_ shall not in any
event be subject to any set-off or reduction with respect to any claim

have access to personnel records of the Seller or the Target Companies

consent of the Seller, (ii) conduct any invasive sampling or testing or any
soil, surface water, groundwater, building materials or other environmental
media, including the conduct of a Phase II environmental site assessment, or

Seller or the Target Companies or any of their respective Affiliates is
subject or which such Person believes in good faith could jeopardize any
solicitor client or other legal privilege. The Purchaser shall abide by

its Affiliates arising in any way therefrom or in any way connection
therewith, and (ii) the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Target Companies, the Seller and any of its Affiliates from and
against any and all Damages attributable to personal injury, death or
physical property damage to any Representative of the Seller and any of its

Representatives with respect to the Target Companies or otherwise in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

its or their respective Representatives; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | that is furnished to Receiving Party on a non-confidential
basis by any third party having a legal right to do so; or 
---|---|--- 
 



49 any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Notwithstanding _Section 6.4(a)_, if a Receiving Party
becomes obligated by Applicable Law to disclose Confidential Information
concerning the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall, if
legally permissible and reasonably practicable, immediately notify Disclosing
Party thereof, so that Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective
order or other, similar remedy or relief with respect to resisting or
narrowing the scope of such disclosure and Receiving Party shall consult and
cooperate with the Disclosing Party to the extent permitted by Applicable Law
with respect to taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such requirement
or legal process. In the absence of such a protective order or other remedy
or relief, the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information;

on the advice of such Partys legal counsel, under United States or Canadian
securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange on which securities of
such Party or any of its Affiliates are listed, in each case, without any
obligation to the other Party, except to provide a copy of such filing or
announcement to such other Party no later than contemporaneously with the
public release of such filing or announcement.

contemplated under this Agreement and the substance and content thereof,
including all marketing, operational, economic or financial knowledge,
information or data of any nature whatsoever relating to Disclosing Party or
any of its Affiliates and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies or other

additional purpose, and where required by applicable Privacy Laws, obtained
the consent of such individual to such additional purpose, or (ii) such use
or disclosure is permitted or authorized by applicable Privacy Laws, without
notice to, or consent from, such individual. The Purchaser shall also give
effect to any withdrawal of consent for continued collection, use or
disclosure of Personal Information following Closing. If the Seller or the
Purchaser terminate this Agreement as provided herein, the Purchaser shall
promptly destroy or return to the Seller all Transaction Personal Information
in the Purchasers possession or in the possession of any of the Purchasers
Representatives, including all copies, reproductions, summaries or extracts

withheld by the Purchaser; provided that, if the Purchaser fails to respond in
writing within 20 Business Days following a written request from the Seller

TAX MATTERS



   9.1 | Liability for Taxes.

     | (a) | The Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from, any Taxes imposed on or
incurred by any of the Target Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Period,
together with any reasonable costs, expenses, losses or damages, including
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys and accountants fees and
expenses, arising out of or incident to the determination, assessment or
collection of such Taxes ("Tax Losses") provided, _however_ , that the
Sellers liability for Tax Losses hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of
any Taxes included in such Tax Losses to the extent such Taxes are taken into
account in determining the Final Net Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and
hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless from, any Tax Losses (i) imposed
on or incurred by or with respect to the Target Companies or the

attributable to a breach by the Purchaser of any covenant with respect to
Taxes in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this _ARTICLE 9_ to determine the
amount of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by or with respect to the Target
Companies for a portion of a taxable period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date which is allocable to a Pre-Closing Period, the determination
shall be made, in the case of property or  _ad valorem_ taxes or franchise
taxes (which are measured by, or based solely upon capital, debt or a
combination of capital and debt), on a _per diem_ basis and, in the case of
other Taxes, by assuming that such  

---|---|--- 
 



62 Closing Date constitutes a separate taxable period applicable to the Target
Companies and by taking into account the actual taxable events occurring
during such period (except that exemptions, allowances and deductions that are
calculated on an annual or periodic basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period ratably on a _per
diem_  basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise
tax paid or payable by the Target Companies shall be allocated to the taxable
period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the
base of such tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business
for another taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise tax.
Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date shall be prorated
based upon the method employed in this _Section 9.1(c)_ taking into account
the type of Tax to which the credit or refund relates. All determinations
necessary to effect the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner
consistent with prior practice of the Target Companies.

provincial or territorial tax laws, amend or permit the Target Companies to
amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Period after the date such Tax
Returns are filed, (ii) extend or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or
permit the Target Companies to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or
other period for the assessment of any Tax or Tax deficiency that relates to

include providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information.

 



   9.4 | Tax Refunds. 
---|--- 

Except to the extent reflected in the final calculation of Final Net Working
Capital or resulting from a carryback (or use) of an item of loss, deduction
or credit arising in a Post-Closing Period, the Seller shall be entitled to
any Tax refunds of any of the Target Companies that are received by the Target
Companies, and any amounts credited against Tax of the Target Companies to
which the Target Companies become entitled, that relate to any Pre-Closing
Period, less any Taxes payable in respect thereof by the Target Companies
("Seller Refunds"). The Purchaser shall pay over to the Seller any such
Seller Refund within 30 Business Days after actual receipt of such refund or
credit against Taxes.

 



64 ---|--- 

If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, reassessment,
audit, examination or other legal proceeding or other claim in respect of
Taxes of the Target Companies for a Pre-Closing Period (a "Tax Claim") shall
be delivered, sent, commenced, or initiated to or against the Purchaser or the
Target Companies by any Taxing Authority that results in or may result in a
Tax Loss for which indemnification may be claimed from the Seller under this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing of such
Tax Claim. The Seller shall have the sole right to represent the Target
Companies interests and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense with
respect to any such Tax Claim; and the Purchaser shall cause the Target
Companies to execute any powers of attorney necessary in order to allow the
Seller to control such contest and to settle any such Tax Claim; _provided_ ,

and tolling) applicable to such Tax matter.

failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein (other than the
representation and warranty in _Section 4.7(a)_) and such breach or failure
to perform (i) if not cured or waived, would give rise to the failure of any
condition specified in _ARTICLE 7_ to be satisfied, (ii) has not been cured
within 45 days following delivery of written notice from the non-defaulting
Party of such breach or failure to perform, and (iii) has not been waived by

representation and warranty in _Section 4.7(a)_ (provided the terminating
Party is not otherwise in default or breach of this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 
 



   10.2 | Effect of Termination. 
---|--- 

If this Agreement is terminated as provided in _Section 10.1_,
such termination shall be without liability and none of the provisions of

Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_ or _Section 10.1(d)_ or if any
Party is otherwise in breach of this Agreement, such termination shall not
relieve such breaching Party of any liability for a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement or be

any such breach.

 

ARTICLE 11

INDEMNIFICATION UPON CLOSING



   11.1 | Indemnification of the Purchaser. 
---|--- 

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, including  _Section
11.11(h)_, from and after the Closing, the Seller shall be liable for and, as
a separate and independent covenant, indemnify, defend and hold the Purchaser
and its Affiliates harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered,
sustained, paid, imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser and its Affiliates as
a result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation

arising out, resulting from or relating to the NAPP PSA, including any
termination thereof.

 



66 ---|--- 

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, including  _Section
11.11(h)_, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be liable for and,
as a separate and independent covenant, indemnify, defend and hold the Seller
and its Affiliates harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered,
sustained, paid, imposed on or incurred by the Seller and its Affiliates as a
result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Purchaser contained in _ARTICLE 4_, (ii) any breach of
any agreement or covenant on the part of the Purchaser made hereunder or (iii)
a Business Guarantee that is a guarantee or performance bond for which
Purchaser does not as at Closing, and for so long thereafter for which
Purchaser does not: (A) effect an assignment and novation or a replacement,
as contemplated in _Section 6.6(c)_; or (B) obtain a permanent release of
Seller or its applicable Affiliate under such Business Guarantee, as
applicable, as contemplated in _Section 6.6(c)_.



   11.3 | Purchasers Environmental Indemnity. 
---|--- 

From and after Closing, subject to _Section 11.11(h)_, the Purchaser shall
be liable for all Damages suffered, sustained, paid, imposed on or incurred by
the Seller and its Affiliates and, in addition and as an independent covenant,
shall defend, indemnify and save harmless the Seller and Affiliates from and
against all Damages suffered, sustained, paid, imposed on or incurred by them
in respect of all past, present and future Environmental Liabilities. This
assumption of liability and indemnity shall apply without limit and without
regard to the negligence of the Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers or employees. The Parties acknowledge
that the Purchase Price has taken into account all of the Environmental
Liabilities and, accordingly, this assumption of liability and indemnity
shall apply in respect of all of the Environmental Liabilities. The Purchaser
hereby waives, and acknowledges and agrees that it shall not exercise, any
right or remedy against the Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers or employees in respect to any such
Environmental Liabilities that the Purchaser may otherwise have under
Applicable Law, including any right to name the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers or employees as a
party to any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, notice of non-
compliance or violation, order or direction, arbitration or investigation
commenced by the Purchaser or by any third party in which the Purchaser is a
party. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 11.3_, nothing in this
_Section 11.3_ shall be construed so as to require the Purchaser to be liable
for or to indemnify the Seller in connection with any such Damages to the
extent arising from the representations and warranties of the Seller contained
in _Section 3.12_ being untrue or incorrect, but only to the extent that the
Seller is liable to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to other provisions of
this _ARTICLE 11_ in respect of such representations and warranties.



   11.4 | Tax Indemnification. 
---|--- 

With the exception of a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Seller contained in _Sections 3.11_ or _3.15(e)_ , nothing
in this _ARTICLE 11_ shall apply to liability with respect to Taxes, the
liability with respect to which shall be as set forth in _ARTICLE 9_.

 



67 ---|--- 

The representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ and _ARTICLE 4_
and the representations contained in the Seller Closing Certificate and the
Purchaser Closing Certificate shall terminate and expire on the day which is
12 months following the Closing Date, except:

 



     | (a) | the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth
in _Section 3.3(c)_ and _Section 3.11_ shall survive until 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all periods
of extension and tolling), except that the representation and warranty in
_Section 3.11(f)_ shall survive for two years following the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth
in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_ and _Section 3.4_ shall survive forever; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | the representations and warranties of the Seller set forth
in _Section 3.7_ and _Section 3.8(a)_ shall survive for two years following
the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | the indemnity under _Section 11.1(iii)_ and _Section
11.1(iv)_ shall survive until 30 days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to claims arising out
of, resulting from or relating to the ETE Merger Agreement or the NAPP PSA,
as applicable; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | the representations and warranties of the Purchaser set
forth in _Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_ shall survive for the period of the
applicable statute of limitations; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (f) | the indemnity under _Section 11.2(iii)_ shall survive until
the Purchaser effects an assignment and novation or replacement and permanent
release of all Business Guarantees that are guarantees or performance bonds
that were not (i) assigned and novated or replaced and (ii) permanently
released as of Closing. 
---|---|--- 

After a representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no
indemnification shall or may be sought on the basis of that representation and
warranty by any Person who would have been entitled pursuant to this _ARTICLE
11_ to indemnification on the basis of that representation and warranty prior
to its termination and expiration, provided that a claim presented in writing
for indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE 11_ on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall not
be affected in any way by that termination and expiration. The covenants and
agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement to be performed after the
Closing shall survive the Closing until fully performed in accordance with
their terms.



   11.6 | Demands. 
---|--- 

Each indemnified Party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery of
facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, such indemnified Party will give prompt notice thereof in writing
to the indemnifying Party that includes (i) the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim and (ii) a formal demand
for

 



68  indemnification under this Agreement that includes. In the case of a claim
for indemnification based on a claim by a third Person against the indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnified Party shall submit with such
notice to the indemnifying Party any demand, assertion, claim, action or
proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by such third Person, with respect to the
matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions
of this Agreement, together with a statement of such information respecting
any of the foregoing as it shall have. The failure of an indemnified Party to
provide notice of a Third Party Claim shall not relieve the indemnifying
Party of its indemnity obligations under this _ARTICLE 11_, except to the
extent such failure results in insufficient time to permit the indemnifying
Party or its counsel to effectively defend against a Third Party Claim and to
make a timely response thereto or otherwise prejudices the indemnifying
Partys ability to defend against such Third Party Claim.

In the case of a claim for indemnification that is not based on a Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of notice of
such claim for the indemnified Party (i) to cure the Damages complained
of, (ii) admit its obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such
Damages or (iii) dispute such claim for indemnification.



   11.7 | Right to Contest and Defend. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its cost and
expense, to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Third
Party Claim for which it is required to indemnify the indemnified Party under
the provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that notice of the intention
to so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying Party to the indemnified
Party within 30 days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying Party of
notice by the indemnified Party of the assertion of the Third Party Claim.
Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
indemnifying Party or the indemnified Party as may be appropriate. Such
contest shall be conducted by counsel employed by the indemnifying Party, but
the indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to
participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own
choosing at its sole cost and expense. If the indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceeding, including any compromise or settlement
thereof; _provided_ that the indemnifying Party shall not agree to a
compromise or settlement that does not include a complete release of the
indemnified Party from all liability will respect to such Third Party Claim or
that imposes any liability or obligation on the indemnified Party without the
consent of the indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If the indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim as provided in _Section 11.7(a)_, the indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against such Third Party Claim with
the counsel of the indemnified Partys choosing; _provided_ that the
indemnifying Party may at any time admit its obligation and assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim prior to settlement or the final determination
thereof. The indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of a Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
---|---|--- 
 



69 Affiliates are contesting or defending against Third Party Claims relating to
the Target Companies, the Target Companies Assets or the Business, the other
Party shall (and, in the case of Purchaser, shall cause the Target Companies
to) cooperate with such contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the
contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony
and access to their books and records as shall be reasonably requested in
connection therewith, with any and all third party costs associated therewith
at the sole cost and expense of such contesting or defending Party. 
---|---|--- 
 



   11.8 | Cooperation. 
---|--- 

If requested by the indemnifying Party, the indemnified Party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third
Party Claim that the indemnifying Party elects to contest or, if appropriate,
in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third Party Claim,
or any cross-complaint against any Person, and the indemnifying Party will
reimburse the indemnified Party for any expenses incurred by it in so
cooperating.



   11.9 | Right to Participate. 
---|--- 

The indemnified Party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Third Party Claim
against the indemnified Party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons. 



   11.10 | Mitigation, Reductions and Subrogation. 
---|--- 

An indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages
and shall respond to any claims that may provide for a basis for
indemnification in the same manner it would respond in the absence of the
indemnification provided in this Agreement. In the event that the indemnified
Party fails to make reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages, or resolve
any claims, the indemnified Party shall not be indemnified to the extent that
any Damages could reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the
indemnified Party had made such efforts. In calculating any amount to be paid
by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the
amount shall be reduced by (a) any net Tax benefit to the indemnified party
related to the Damages, and (b) all insurance proceeds recoverable by the
indemnified Party related to the Damages and any other third party payment
received or receivable by the indemnified Party related to the Damages. An
indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue, and to
cause its Affiliates to pursue, all insurance or other third-party claims to
which it may be entitled in connection with any Damages it incurs. If any
indemnified Party (or an Affiliate) receives any insurance or other third-
party payment in connection with any Damages for which it has already
received an indemnification payment with respect to an indemnity claim from
the indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the indemnifying

 



70  Party, within ten Business Days of receiving such insurance or third-party
payment, the excess of (a) the sum of the amount previously received from the
indemnifying Party plus the amount of such payment, over (b) the total amount
of Damages with respect to such indemnity claim that the indemnified Party is
entitled to receive under this _ARTICLE 11_. Upon making a full payment of
any indemnity claim, the indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such
indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified Party
against any third party in respect of the Damages to which the indemnity
payment relates.

 



   11.11 | Limitations on Indemnification. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | To the extent that the Purchaser would otherwise be entitled
to indemnification for Damages pursuant to _Section 11.1_, the Seller shall
be liable only if: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the Damages with respect to a claim exceed $750,000 (the
"Minimum Claim Amount"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the sum of (A) the aggregate of all Damages that exceed the
Minimum Claim Amount, _plus_ (B) the aggregate of all Damages pursuant to
Section 11.1 of the Other SPA that exceed the Other SPA Minimum Claim Amount
exceeds $20,000,000, and then the Seller shall be liable only for Damages
pursuant to _Section 11.1_ to the extent of any excess over $15,000,000 (the
"Deductible Amount"); 
---|---|--- 
 



     |  | provided that in no event shall the Sellers and the Other
Sellers aggregate liability to the Purchaser under _Section 11.1_ of this
Agreement and Section 11.1 of the Other SPA exceed 25.0% of the Combined
Purchase Price (the "Ceiling Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing: 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | neither the Deductible Amount nor the Ceiling Amount shall
apply to breaches or inaccuracies of representations and warranties contained
in _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.4_ and  _Section 3.20_; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | the Ceiling Amount shall not apply to breaches or
inaccuracies of representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.3(c)_,
_Section 3.7_ and _Section 3.8(a)_; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | the Sellers aggregate liability for a breach or inaccuracy
of such _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3(c)_, _Section 3.4_,
_Section 3.7, Section 3.8(a)_ and _Section 3.20_ shall not exceed an amount
equal to the Combined Purchase Price _minus_ the sum of (A) the amount of all
other Damages payable by the Seller hereunder _plus_ (B) the amount of all
other Damages payable by the Other Seller under the Other SPA; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | the Minimum Claim Amount and the Deductible Amount shall
not apply to breaches or inaccuracies of representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.11(f)_, but for clarity, the Ceiling Amount shall
apply, provided that, in the case of any breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.11(f)_, Damages will
be calculated in the manner described in _Section 11.11(g)_; and 
---|---|--- 
 



71 Amount or the Ceiling Amount shall apply to amounts owed pursuant to _Sections
2.6_ and _2.7_ , the indemnities under _Section 11.1(iii)_ and _ Section
11.1(iv)_, or to any breach by Seller of any of the post-Closing covenants of
Seller hereunder, its covenant in Section 6.1(a) (insofar as it relates to
Sellers obligation to make expenditures included in the PDH Budget) or any
of its covenants contained in _Sections 6.1(b)(v)_, _6.1(b)(vii)_ ,
_6.1(b)(viii)_ , _6.1(b)(ix)_ , _6.1(b)(x)_ , _6.1(b)(xi)_ , _6.1(b)(xii)_ ,
_6.1(b)(xiv)_ and, to the extent pertaining to the previous identified items
in _Section 6.1_, _6.1(b)(xv)_ and _Sections 6.7_, _6.8_ and _6.14_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Neither the Purchaser, on the one hand, nor the Seller, on
the other hand, will be liable under this Agreement for any consequential,
incidental, special, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages suffered or
incurred by the other Party, except to the extent such consequential,
incidental, special, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages are included in
any Third Party Claim against an indemnified Party for which such indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. In addition,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Damages indemnifiable by
the Seller under _Section 11.1_ shall expressly exclude any and all
diminution in value. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | No Party to this Agreement shall be liable to indemnify a
Party seeking indemnification for Damages resulting from or relating to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement if
the Party seeking such indemnification for such Damages had Knowledge of such
breach or inaccuracy prior to the date of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | No Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other
Party pursuant to _Section 11.1_ or _11.2_ , as the case may be, with respect
to any Damages or alleged Damages to the extent that the matter forming the
basis for such Damages or alleged Damages was taken into account in the
determination of Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | An indemnified Party shall not be entitled to multiple
recovery of any Damages even though such Damages may have resulted from the
breach, inaccuracy or failure to perform of more than one of the
representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of the indemnifying
Party in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (as determined pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement) for Tax purposes. 
---|---|--- 
 



72 in the case of any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in _Section 3.11(f)_, no Damages will be payable unless
the balances of undepreciated capital cost, cumulative eligible capital and
non-capital losses set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.11(f)_, in the
aggregate (the "Aggregate Scheduled Tax Pool Amount"), are reduced as a
result of an audit, used by the Seller or otherwise such that the actual
balances at Closing of such undepreciated capital cost, cumulative eligible
capital and non-capital losses, in the aggregate (the "Aggregate Actual Tax
Pool Amount"), are less than the Aggregate Scheduled Tax Pool Amount, in
which case, the Damages shall be equal to (A) the difference of the Aggregate
Scheduled Tax Pool Amount _minus_ the Aggregate Actual Tax Pool Amount
_multiplied by_  (B) 8.0 percent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (h) | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
including Section 11.1, _Section 11.2_ and _Section 11.3_, an indemnified
Party shall not make a claim under this Agreement for, nor shall such
indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement from and
against, any Damages to the extent a claim for indemnification for Damages
arising out of the same claim, loss or event is or has been made by such Party
or its Affiliate under the Other SPA. 
---|---|--- 



   11.12 | Sole Remedy. 
---|--- 

Should the Closing occur, neither the Seller nor the Purchaser shall have any
liability under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby except
as is provided in _Section 6.3(d)_, _ARTICLE 3_ or this _ARTICLE 11_ (other
than claims or causes of action arising from intentional fraud and relating
to this Agreement). From and after the Closing, except for the remedies
provided in _Section 6.3(d)_, _ARTICLE 9_ or this _ARTICLE 11_ (and claims
or causes of action arising from intentional fraud and relating to
this Agreement), the Seller and the Purchaser each release, remise and
forever discharge the other Party and its Affiliates and such other Partys
and its Affiliates Representatives from any and all suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, claims, demands, damages, losses, costs
liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in equity and
whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, common law or otherwise,

with the substantive laws of the Province of Alberta and the laws of Canada
applicable therein, without reference to principles of conflicts of law.  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Each Party irrevocably attorns and submits to the
jurisdiction of the Alberta courts situated in the City of Calgary and waives
objection to the venue of any proceeding in such court or that such court
provides an inconvenient forum. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Each Party irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by
jury in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or related to this Agreement or
the transaction contemplated hereby or the actions of the Purchaser or the
Seller in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof. 
---|---|--- 



   12.6 | Public Statements. 
---|--- 

The Parties shall consult with each other regarding the initial public
announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby made by each Party; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, including anything to the contrary in _Section
6.4,_ nothing in this  _Section 12.6_ shall prevent the Party desiring to
make such

 



75  announcement from furnishing any information to any Governmental Authority
or regulatory authority or stock exchange or to the public insofar only as
such Party obtains advice from legal counsel that a public announcement is
required by this Agreement, Applicable Law or stock exchange regulations
applicable to such Party, in which case the disclosing Party shall not have
any requirement to consult with such other Party regarding such
public announcement or statement prior to its release.



   12.7 | Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | This Agreement, the Closing Documents and the guarantees
referenced in _Section 6.10_ constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each Party agrees that neither the
other Party nor any of such other Partys Representatives has made any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such Party
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than
those expressly set forth herein, in the Closing Documents and the guarantees
referenced in  _Section 6.10_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | No supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by each Party to be bound thereby.
No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or
shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of
whether similar), nor shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver
unless otherwise expressly provided. 
---|---|--- 
 



   12.8 | Conflicting Provisions. 
---|--- 

This Agreement and the Closing Documents, read as a whole, set forth the
Parties rights, responsibilities and liabilities with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In this Agreement and the Closing
Documents, and as between them, specific provisions prevail over general
provisions. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Closing
Documents, this Agreement shall control.



   12.9 | Binding Effect and Assignment. 
---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, but neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or obligations hereunder shall
be assigned or transferred, by operation of law or otherwise, by any Party
without the prior written consent of each other Party; _provided_ that the
Seller may designate an Affiliate to receive payment of the Purchase Price
under _Section 2.2_ in accordance with _Section 2.4_. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder.

 



76 ---|--- 

If one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision or provisions had never been contained herein.



   12.11 | Specific Performance. 
---|--- 

The Parties recognize that in the event of any breach of this Agreement
(whether or not such breach is material or willful), monetary damages alone
would not be adequate to compensate the other Party for its injuries. The non-
breaching Party shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies
that may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement. If any action is brought to enforce this Agreement, the breaching
Party shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at law. The
breaching Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy. The breaching Party further agrees
that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action
for equitable relief by the non-breaching Party is that it contests
the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.



   12.12 | Provisions Respecting Legal Representation. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on his or its own behalf
and, as applicable, on behalf of its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, McMillan LLP and Andrews Kurth LLP (or any successor) may
serve as counsel to the Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with any
action, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding such representation of
the Target Companies and each of the Parties hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such Parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that each of
McMillan LLP and Andrews Kurth LLP has represented the Seller and the Target
Companies prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties agree that any attorney-client
privilege or attorney work-product protection attaching as a result of
McMillan LLPs and Andrews Kurths representation of the Seller and the Target
Companies prior to the Closing Date and in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including concerning subject matter to which
the Seller has or may have an indemnification obligation hereunder, and all
information and documents subject to such privilege or protection, shall
belong to and be controlled by the Seller, and may be waived only by the
Seller, and shall not pass or be claimed or used by the Purchaser or the
Target Companies; _provided_ , that in the event of a dispute between the
Target Companies and a third party (other than a Party or a Partys
Affiliates) after the Closing Date, the Target Companies may assert the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product protection to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party. 
---|---|--- 
 



77 ---|--- 

It is expressly agreed by the Parties that neither this Agreement nor any of
the Closing Documents shall be construed against any Party, and no
consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted
this Agreement, any Closing Document or any provision hereof or thereof or who
supplied the form of this Agreement or any of the Closing Documents. Each
Party agrees that this Agreement has been purposefully drawn and correctly
reflects its understanding of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and, therefore, waives the application of any law, regulation, holding or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

 



   12.14 | Disclosure Schedules. 
---|--- 

Any information set forth on any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply
and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant
to such other section or subsection. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of the Purchaser and (b) the
disclosure by the Seller of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not
be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by the Seller that the matter is
required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is
material.

 



   12.15 | Multiple Counterparts; Signature. 
---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.
