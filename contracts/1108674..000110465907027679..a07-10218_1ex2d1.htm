2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time,
each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock are so converted
shall be the only shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

  

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_.

  

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the
part of the holder thereof (except as expressly provided herein), be
converted into and represent the right to receive an amount of cash, without
interest, equal to the Cash Amount Per Share. The amount of cash each

Per Share_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the

Option multiplied by (B) the Cash Amount Per Share, less the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option;

entitled to deduct and withhold from such payment made to such holder the

amount of cash each Company Optionholder is entitled to receive for the
Company Options (other than Company Options with an exercise price equal to
or greater than the Cash Amount Per Share) held by such Company Optionholder
shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash
amounts for all Company Options (other than Company Options with an exercise
price equal to or in excess of the Cash Amount Per Share) held by such
Company Optionholder.

  

(iii) _Vested Company Options with an Exercise Price Equal to or Greater than

(except as expressly provided herein), shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any payment or other consideration or the issuance of any securities
in exchange or substitution therefor.

part of the holder thereof , shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
payment or other consideration or the issuance of any securities in exchange
or substitution therefor.

  

(v) The Company shall cause the administrator of each of the Company Option
Plans to take any actions necessary under the terms of such Company Option
Plans to enable the treatment of the Company Options in the Merger as set
forth in subclauses (ii) through (iv) of this _Section 2.1(b)_.

  

(c) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Stock_. Notwithstanding _Section
2.1(b)_, each share of Company Capital Stock held by the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

  

(d) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the
Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of

referencing a representation or warranty herein (each of which exceptions, in
order to be effective, shall clearly indicate the section and, if applicable,
the subsection of this _Article 3_ to which it relates unless and to

reasonably apparent from the actual text of the disclosed exception), the
Company represents and warrants to Acquiror as follows:

  

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on the Company Business.
The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate with any
such other failures, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to Acquiror true and complete
copies of the Company Charter Documents. The Company is not in violation of
the Company Charter Documents.

  

3.2 _Company Subsidiaries_.

  

(a) _Organization and Good Standing_. _Schedule 3.2(a)_ of the

Company Subsidiaries. Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each Company Subsidiary has the
requisite corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and
authority, as applicable, to own, operate and lease its properties and to
carry on its business as currently conducted and as presently proposed to be
conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified and in good standing or licensed to do
business, individually or in the aggregate with any such other failures,
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; without limiting the foregoing, each
respective Company Subsidiary is so qualified or licensed and in good
standing in each jurisdiction listed on  _Schedule 3.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The Company has delivered to Acquiror true and complete
copies of the currently effective Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or

Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or other comparable charter
documents), each as amended to date.

  

(b) _Ownership_. The Company is the direct or indirect owner of all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each Company Subsidiary and all such shares or other equity interests are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interest of
each Company Subsidiary are owned by the Company free and clear of all
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) and are not subject to any
preemptive right or right of first refusal created by statute, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or other comparable charter
documents), as applicable, of such Company Subsidiary or any agreement to

        

which such Company Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound.  There are
no stock appreciation rights, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,

Subsidiary or any securities or debt convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock of a Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant,
call, right, commitment, conversion privilege or preemptive or other right or
agreement. Other than the Company Subsidiaries set forth in _Schedule 3.2(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company does not have any Subsidiaries
or any equity or ownership interest (or any interest convertible or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or ownership interest), whether
direct or indirect, in any Person. The Company is not obligated to make nor

capital contribution to or on behalf of any other Person.

by any party to the Audit Committee of the Company Board since January
1, 2004 pursuant to the procedures established in accordance with
Section 10A(m)(4) of the Exchange Act. The Company has delivered to Acquiror
complete and correct copies of any written complaints, reports or
allegations, and a reasonably detailed summary of any verbal complaints,
reports or allegations, made or submitted by any attorney representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Companys chief executive officer,
any supervising attorney or any committee of the Company Board, including any
qualified legal compliance committee, as contemplated by the rules set forth
in 17 CFR Part 205 with respect to any material violation.

  

(d) _Controls_. The Company has established and maintains and adheres to a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that except as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (i) transactions of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries are being executed only in accordance with
appropriate authorizations of management and, where required by Applicable
Laws or the Companys code of conduct, by the Company Board, (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit preparation of financial
statements in compliance with GAAP and (B) to maintain accountability for
assets, (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (iv) the amount recorded for assets on
the books and records of the Company is compared with the existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences. There are no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses"
(as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design
or operation of the Companys internal controls and procedures which could
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data. To the Companys knowledge, there is no fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other current or former
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries who have a role
in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has
established and maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in
Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the "principal
executive officer" and the "principal financial officer" of the Company
required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Act with respect to such reports, and
such controls are reasonably effective for this purpose. Each of the
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer of the
Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes Act and the rules and regulations promulgated

        

thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Reports and the statements
contained in such certifications are true and accurate as of the date hereof.
 The Company has established and maintains "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rule13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and
such internal control over financial reporting are effective based on the
criteria issued by the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Committee on "Internal Control-Integrated Framework."

  

(e) _Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or
arrangement (including without limitation any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate on the other hand), including without limitation any "off-balance
sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
the Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

  

(f) _Amendments_. The Company has heretofore delivered to Acquiror a complete
and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been
filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company
with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. No "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC) filed as an exhibit to the Company SEC Documents has
been amended or modified, except for amendments or modifications so furnished
or which have been filed as an exhibit to a subsequently dated Company SEC
Document. The Company has heretofore delivered to Acquiror a complete and
correct copy of any comment letters or similar correspondence received by the
Company from the SEC for the Companys three prior fiscal years and current
fiscal year.  The SEC has not provided comments to the Company in connection
with any Company SEC Documents that to the Companys knowledge remain
unresolved and are material. No investigation by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

  

(g) _Proxy Statement_. The information supplied by the Company for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement shall not at the time the Proxy Statement is filed
with the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein or incorporated by reference therein not misleading.
The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement
is mailed to Company Stockholders, at the time of the meeting of Company
Stockholders to consider the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
**Company Stockholders  Meeting**"), or as of the Effective Time, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false
or misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the

        

solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting which has
become false or misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes
no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
Acquiror or Merger Sub that is contained in the Proxy Statement.

  

3.7 _Litigation_. There is no action, suit, arbitration, mediation,
proceeding or, to the Companys knowledge, claim or investigation pending

assets or properties (or against any officer, director, employee or agent of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in their capacity as such or relating
to their employment, services or relationship with the Company or
such Company Subsidiary) before any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or
mediator that is, or is reasonably likely to be, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has
any such action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation been threatened. There is no judgment, decree, injunction or
order of any Governmental Authority, arbitrator or mediator outstanding

Company, against any officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary in their capacity as such or relating to their
employment, services or relationship with the Company or such
Company Subsidiary). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation
pending against any Governmental Authority or other Person. ** **There are

issues (each, an " **Internal Investigation** "). The Company has delivered to
Acquiror complete and correct copies of any written reports,

Internal Investigation to the extent that a written report with respect
thereto was not or has not been prepared, whether such Internal Investigation
is currently pending or was conducted in the past since January 1, 2003. To
the Companys knowledge, there is no basis for any person to assert a claim
against the Company based upon: (a) the Companys entering into this
Agreement or consummating the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (b) a claim of ownership of, or options, warrants or
other rights to acquire ownership of, any shares of Company Capital Stock or

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to
or affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered at a proceeding at law or in equity).
Neither the Company nor any

        

Company Subsidiary is in default under any Company Material Contract and, to
the Companys knowledge, there is no event, occurrence, condition or act,
with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to the knowledge of

the right to exercise any remedy under any Company Material Contract, (B) the
right to a material rebate, chargeback, refund, credit, penalty or change in

or any Company Subsidiary may address in operating the Company Business or
restricting the prices which the Company or any Company Subsidiary may charge
for its products, technology or services (including most favored customer

Subsidiary of exclusive rights or licenses, rights of refusal, rights of

3.14 _Intellectual Property_.

  

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary (i) owns or (ii) has the valid
right or license to use, and, to the extent that it does any of the
following, to develop, make, have

        

made, offer for sale, sell, import, copy, modify, create derivative works of,
distribute, license, and/or dispose of all Intellectual Property used in the
conduct of the Company Business (such Intellectual Property being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " **Company IP Rights** "). Such Company IP
Rights are sufficient for such conduct of the Company Business. As used in
this Agreement, " **Company-Owned IP Rights** " means Company IP Rights that
are or are purportedly owned or exclusively licensed to the Company or any
Subsidiary; and " **Company-Licensed IP Rights** " means Company IP Rights
that are not Company-Owned IP Rights.

  

(b) Except as provided in _Schedule 3.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall, in accordance with their terms: (i) constitute a
material breach of or default under any instrument, license or other Contract
governing any material Company IP Right (collectively, the " **Company IP
Rights Agreements** "); (ii) cause the forfeiture or termination of, or give
rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of, any material Company IP
Right; or (iii) materially impair the right of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to use, develop, make, have made, offer
for sale, sell, import, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute,
license, and/or dispose of any material Company IP Right or portion thereof.
After the Closing, all Company-Owned IP Rights will be fully transferable,
alienable or licensable by the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror without
restriction and without payment of any kind to any third party.

  

(c) Neither the operation of the Company Business nor the use, development,
testing, manufacture, marketing, licensing, sale, offering for sale,
distribution, or intended use of any Company Product or Service (i) violates
(or will violate) any license or other Contract between the Company or such
Company Subsidiary and any third party, or (ii) infringes or misappropriates
(or will infringe or misappropriate) any Intellectual Property right of any
other party. There is no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened,
claim or litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to exercise any Company IP Right, nor to
the Companys knowledge is there any legitimate basis for any such claim.
 Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any
notice asserting that the operation of the Company Business or the
development, manufacture, marketing, licensing, sale, offering for sale,
distribution or intended use of the Company Products or Services conflicts
with or infringes (or will conflict with or infringe) the rights of any other
party, nor to the Companys knowledge is there any legitimate basis for any
such assertion. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
any notice from any third party offering a license under any such third party
patents. None of the Company-Owned IP Rights, Company-Licensed IP Rights,
the Company Products or Services, the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is subject to any proceeding or outstanding order or stipulation
(i) restricting in any manner the use, distribution, transfer, or licensing
by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries of any Company-Owned IP Rights,
any Company-Licensed IP Rights or any Company Product or Service, or which
may affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such Company-Owned IP
Rights, Company-Licensed IP Rights or Company Product or Service, or (ii)
restricting the conduct of the Company Business in order to accommodate
Intellectual Property rights of a third party.

  

(d) No current or former employee, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has developed any technology, software

any Company Subsidiary that is subject to any Contract under which such
employee, consultant or independent contractor has assigned or otherwise
granted to any third party any rights (including Intellectual Property) in or
to such technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work. Neither the employment of any employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, nor the use by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
of the services of any consultant or independent contractor subjects the
Company or such Company Subsidiary to any Liability to any third party
for improperly soliciting such employee, consultant or independent contractor
to work for the Company or such Company Subsidiary, whether such Liability is
based on contractual or other legal obligations to such third party.

  

(e) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken commercially reasonable
steps to protect, preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of
all confidential or non-public information included in the Company IP Rights.

proprietary information of the Company or such Company Subsidiary, its
customers or business partners and inventions owned by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary have executed and delivered to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary an agreement regarding the protection of such
proprietary information to the Company or such Company Subsidiary (in the
case of proprietary information of the Companys or such Company Subsidiarys
customers and business partners, to the extent required by such customers and
business partners); and copies of all forms of such agreements have been
delivered to Acquirors legal counsel. The Company has secured valid written
assignments from all of the Companys and the Company Subsidiaries current
and former consultants, independent contractors and employees who were
involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or development of any
Company-Owned IP Rights, of the rights to such contributions that may be
owned by such persons or that the Company does not already own by operation
of law. No current or former employee, officer, director, consultant or
independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any
right, license, claim or interest whatsoever in or with respect to any
Company-Owned IP Rights.

Company or such Company Subsidiary is the record owner thereof.

right, license and interest of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
and to all Company-Licensed IP Rights are free and clear of all Encumbrances
and licenses (other than restrictions contained in the applicable license

or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) shall, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure or
delivery by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other party acting
on its behalf to any party of any Company Source Code.   _Schedule 3.14(i)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each Contract pursuant to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has deposited, or is or may be required
to deposit, with an escrow agent or other party, any Company Source Code and
further describes whether the execution of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in and of itself, would reasonably be expected to result in the
release from escrow of any Company Source Code. As used in this _Section

software source code, or confidential manufacturing specifications or
designs, or any material portion or aspect of the software source code or

including any employee or former employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

Statement in

        

definitive form with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders. The Company will as promptly as practicable advise
Acquiror, of the time when the Proxy Statement (in both preliminary and
definitive form) has been filed with the SEC or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or any oral or written
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or the receipt of any
comments of the SEC thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information and will as promptly as practicable provide Acquiror
with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission.  The Company will respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto. In the event that the Company receives any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement, Acquiror shall as promptly as
practicable provide to the Company, upon the reasonable request of the
Company, any information concerning Acquiror that Acquiror reasonably
determines is required to enable the Company to adequately respond to such
comments or such request. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event or information (including any Change of Recommendation) relating to the
Company, or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Acquiror or the Company which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein or incorporated by reference
therein not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall as
promptly as practicable notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by law,
disseminated to the stockholders the Company. Prior to filing the Proxy
Statement in both preliminary and definitive form, any amendments or
supplements thereto or any other filing with the SEC, or responding to any
comments or inquiries by the SEC with respect to any filings related to the
Merger, the Company will provide Acquiror with reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on each such filing or response in advance and shall give
due consideration to and act reasonably and in good faith with respect to the
incorporation of any changes in such filings or responses reasonably proposed
by Acquiror.

  

(b) _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, take all action
necessary in accordance with the Company Charter Documents, Applicable Law
and the rules of NASDAQ to duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting. Subject to _Section 5.2(d)_ , the Company will use
all commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and will take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on
the adoption of this Agreement, or, if, as of the time for which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. The
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance
with the Company Charter Documents, Applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ.
Without the prior written consent of Acquiror, adoption of this Agreement

        

(including adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting, if necessary, if
a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement), is the only matter
which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at
the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation by
the Special Committee, the Company Board or any other Company Board
committee, adoption of this Agreement shall be submitted to the
Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.

  

(c) _Board Recommendation_. Except to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 5.2(d)_, (i) the Special Committee shall recommend that the Company
Board adopt this Agreement, (ii) each of the Special Committee and the
Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting,
(iii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the
Special Committee has unanimously recommended, and the Company Board has
recommended, that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this
Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and (iv) neither the Special
Committee, the Company Board nor any other committee of the Company Board
shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the recommendation that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

  

5.2 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) _Alternative Transaction_. The Company agrees that, following the date of
this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement, it shall not and will cause its
Subsidiaries not to, (i) permit any of its or its Subsidiaries officers,
directors, employees, affiliates, attorneys, financial advisors or other
agents or representatives (collectively, " **Representatives** ") to,
directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, seek,  endorse, recommend,
facilitate, support or knowingly encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer
from, furnish any non-public information to, or participate in any
discussions or negotiations, or enter into any agreement with, any party or
group regarding any Alternative Transaction (except to disclose the existence
of the provisions of this _Section 5.2_ ), (ii) approve, endorse or recommend
any Alternative Transaction (except to the extent specifically permitted by
_Section 5.2(d)_ ), or (iii) enter into any letter of intent or similar
document or any Contract relating to any Alternative Transaction Proposal.
The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, and, upon Acquirors request, shall request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished to any Person with which the Company, its Subsidiaries or
Representatives have engaged in any such activities within the 12-month
period preceding the Agreement Date. The Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce (and will not waive any provisions of) any confidentiality
or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) which the Company of any
of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal. Any breach of the foregoing provisions of this
subsection by any of the Companys Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach by the Company.

        

(b) _Notification_. As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours) after receipt by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives or the Principal Stockholder of any Alternative Transaction
Proposal or any request or any indication of interest or inquiry that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative
Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Acquiror with written notice
of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction
Proposal, request, indication of interest or inquiry, and the identity of the
Person or Group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request,
indication of interest or inquiry and a copy of all written materials
provided to it in connection with such Alternative Transaction Proposal,
request, indication of interest or inquiry. In addition, the Company shall as
promptly as practicable keep Acquiror reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request, indication of interest or inquiry (including
any substantive modifications or proposed substantive modifications thereto),
and, without limitation of the other provisions of this _Section 5.2_ , shall
promptly provide to Acquiror a copy of all written materials (including
written materials provided by email or otherwise in electronic format)
subsequently provided by or to it in connection with such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request, indication of interest or inquiry.  The
Company shall provide Acquiror with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser
prior notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors) of any
meeting of the Special Committee, of the Company Board or of any
other committee of the Company Board at which it is reasonably expected to
consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal or Alternative Transaction,
including to consider whether such Alternative Transaction Proposal is a
Superior Proposal.

  

(c) _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in _Section 5.2(a)_ , in the event that prior to the time that Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, the Company receives an unsolicited,
bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which is determined to be,
or which the Special Committee and the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
is reasonably likely to become, a Superior Proposal, the Company, the Special
Committee or the Company Board may then take the following actions, but only
if (i) (A) each of the Special Committee and the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it is
required to do so to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Stockholders under Applicable Law, and (B) the Company has given Acquiror
prior written notice of its intention to take any of the following actions
and of the identity of the Person or Group making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal and the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Transaction Proposal, and (ii) it shall not have breached
any of the provisions of this _Section 5.2_ :

  

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or Group making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, provided that (A) the Company first shall
have received from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to Companys
confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement,
which confidentiality agreement shall not include any provision having the
actual or purported effect of restricting the Company from fulfilling its
obligations under this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement and shall
require such Person to agree to customary employee non-solicitation
provisions covering at least 12 months from execution of such confidentiality
agreement and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such

        

Person or Group, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Acquiror (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to
Acquiror); and

  

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or Group with
respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  

(d) _Changes of Recommendation_ Solely in response to the receipt of an
unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative Transaction Proposal which each of
the Special Committee and the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, is a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation or
recommend such Superior Proposal, if all of the following conditions in
clauses (i) through (vi) are met:

  

(i) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal;

  

(ii) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

  

(iii) the Company has (A) provided to Acquiror three Business Days prior
written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person or Group of Persons making the
Superior Proposal, and (3) that it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and the manner in which it intends to do so, (B) provided to
Acquiror all materials and information delivered or made available to the
Person or Group making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior
Proposal, and (C) during the aforementioned three Business Day period, if
requested by Acquiror, engaged in good faith negotiations to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Superior Proposal would no longer be
a Superior Proposal;

  

(iv) Acquiror shall not have, within the aforementioned three Business Day
period, made an offer that the Special Committee has in good faith determined
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
results in the Alternative Transaction Proposal that had been determined to
be a Superior Proposal no longer being a Superior Proposal;

  

(v) the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and
the results of any negotiations with Acquiror as contemplated by subsection
(iii) above and any offer from Acquiror contemplated by subsection (iv)
above, the Special Committee is required to effect a Change of Recommendation
to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Law; and

  

(vi) the Company shall have complied with the provisions set forth in this
_Section 5.2_.

  

(e) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company, the Special Committee or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a), or Item 1012(a) of

        

Regulation M-A, promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided that the Company
shall not effect, or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position
which constitutes, a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted
pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.2(d)_.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including
_Article 9_ ), a factually accurate public statement by the Company that
solely describes the receipt of an Alternative Transaction Proposal and the
operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed to
constitute a Change of Recommendation, or an approval or recommendation or
neutral position with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

  

(f) Acquiror and the Company acknowledge that pursuant to the terms of the
Voting Agreement, upon a Change of Recommendation effected in accordance with
this _Section 5.2_ , the Voting Agreement shall terminate.

  

5.3 _Maintenance of Business_.

intact the Company Business and its relationships with customers, suppliers,
manufacturers, employees and others who are parties to any Material Contract,
in each case in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as it
has prior to the Agreement Date consistent with its past practices. If the
Company becomes aware of a material deterioration in the relationship with
any key customer, key supplier, key manufacturer or key employee, it shall
promptly bring such information to Acquirors attention in writing and, if
requested by Acquiror, shall exert reasonable commercial efforts to promptly
restore the relationship.

change in the obligations of any party in connection with, or terminate as a
result of the consummation of, the Merger or the Divestiture.

Authority, including all required Antitrust Filings, and (ii) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

Acquiror on, all the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority or third party in connection with the Merger, the

the foregoing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) promptly notify Acquiror of, and if in writing, furnish Acquiror with
copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the other
orally of) any communications from or with any Governmental Authority
(whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with respect to the Merger, the
Divestiture or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) permit Acquiror to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of Acquiror in connection with, any proposed written (or any

contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to the extent practicable, not

extent permitted by such Governmental Authority gives Acquiror the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat, (iv) furnish Acquiror with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger, the Divestiture or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger and/or
the Divestiture, and (v) furnish Acquiror with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as Acquiror may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary

   

59  

   

filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Authority.
 The Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to Acquiror under this
_Section 5.6_ as "outside counsel only." Such material and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.

  

(c) _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated

regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not take any action to render inapplicable or to exempt any third
Person from, any state takeover law or state law that purports to limit or
restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares
of capital stock unless (i) required to do so by order of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) the Special Committee has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of a
Superior Proposal with respect to the Company, it is required to take such
action to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Law.

  

5.7 _Access to Information_. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to Acquiror and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Acquiror, reasonable access
at all reasonable times during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records (provided, that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and, during such period and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Acquiror (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Acquiror may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such information if the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
doing so would jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege.
 No review pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants
or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereto under this Agreement.

  

5.8 _Confidentiality_. The Company will hold and keep confidential, and will
cause its officers and employees and will direct its accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives and Affiliates to hold and keep
confidential, any nonpublic information in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement

        

will remain in full force and effect.

  

5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company will consult with Acquiror
before issuing, and will provide Acquiror the opportunity to review, comment
upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on,
any press release or other public statements to be made by the Company with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as the Company may determine in
good faith is required by Applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
NASDAQ. In addition, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the
Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.1_ or prior
communications consented to in accordance with this _Section 5.9_ , the
Company shall not issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or disclosure concerning Acquiror or its business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of Acquiror,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The initial
press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be in the form agreed to by the parties.

  

5.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) _Termination of Benefit Plans_.

  

(i)  The Company agrees to take all such actions as are necessary
or appropriate to terminate each Company Employee Plan that is subject to
Section 401(k) of the Code effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. Acquiror shall receive from the Company, not later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing, evidence that such Company Employee Plans
will be terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board, or
resolutions of the Board of Directors of the relevant Subsidiary of the
Company that maintains any such Company Employee Plan, and such other
instruments (the form and substance of such resolutions and instruments shall
be subject to review and approval of Acquiror), effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that distribution or
rollover of assets from the trust or custodial account of a 401(k) plan which
is terminated is reasonably anticipated to result in liquidation charges,
surrender charges, or other fees to be imposed upon the account of any
participant or beneficiary of such terminated plan or upon the Company or
plan sponsor, then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Acquiror as soon as possible following the date of
this Agreement.

  

(ii) The Company agrees to take all such actions as are necessary or
appropriate to terminate each Company Employee Plan that is a "welfare plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and provides medical, health, life
insurance and disability plans effective as of the Effective Time (or such
later time as is designated by the Acquiror in a written notice to the
Company prior to the Effective Time) to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law.

  

(iii) The Company agrees to terminate any and all group severance, separation
or salary continuation plans, programs, or arrangements that are covered
under ERISA, as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.

        

(iv) The Company shall provide all notices required for protected benefits
under a Company Employee Plan terminated pursuant to subclause (i) of this
Section 5.10(a) under the Code, including, but not limited to notices
pursuant to Section 411(d)(6) of the Code, which notices shall be subject to
reasonable review and approval of Acquiror.

  

(b) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall terminate the Company ESPP immediately
prior to the Effective Time.  To the extent any offering period under the
Company ESPP is in progress prior to such termination, the Company shall
ensure that such offering period ends upon such termination, and any
outstanding Company Options under the Company ESPP are exercised, on or prior
to such termination in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.

  

(c) _Termination of Employees_.  To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
and subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable Employment
Agreement, the Company agrees to take all such actions as are necessary to
terminate the employment of each employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company who has not been offered employment by Acquiror or who does not
accept Acquirors offer of employment prior to the Effective Time, effective
as of the Effective Time. The Company shall provide each of the employees of
the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company whose employment is terminated as
of the Effective Time with severance payments and benefits that are at least
as favorable as it has provided to similarly situated terminated employees in
the past. The Company shall honor and perform all of its obligations under
the employment, severance, retention, sales or other bonus agreements,
service contracts, and stay-put agreements and other similar arrangements and
all change of control and acceleration provisions in all Company Employee
Plans as listed in _Schedule 5.10(c)_ in favor of employees of the Company as
of the Closing Date in accordance with the terms thereof at the Companys
expense.

  

(d) The Company will consult with Acquiror (and consider in good faith the
advice of Acquiror) prior to sending any material notices or other
communication materials to its employees regarding the matters described in
this _Section 5.10_ and any other matters relative to the entry into the
Agreement or the effects of the Merger.

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.5_ , nothing herein
expressed or implied shall confer upon an current or former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or upon any representative of any such
person, or upon any collective bargaining agent, any rights or remedies,
including any third party beneficiary rights of any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  

5.11 _Resignations_. To the extent requested by Acquiror in writing prior to
the Closing, on the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be delivered to
Acquiror duly signed resignations, effective as of the Effective Time, of the
directors of the Company and the Subsidiaries designated by Acquiror.

  

5.12 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Acquiror
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and no such litigation shall be

        

settled without Acquirors prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

5.13 _Third Party Consents_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Agreement Date, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties set forth on
_Schedule 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.  In connection with
seeking such consents, waivers and approvals, the Company shall keep Acquiror
reasonably informed of all material developments and, shall at Acquirors
request, include Acquiror in any discussions or communications with any
parties whose consent, waiver or approval is sought hereunder. Such consents,
waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror.
For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Company to obtain any such
consent, approval or waiver following the Companys commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain same shall not affect the Acquirors obligation to
consummate the Merger. In the event the Merger does not close for any
reason, Acquiror shall not have any liability to the Company or its
stockholders for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the
Company seeking to obtain such consents, waivers and approvals.

  

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

5.15 _Lease Estoppels_. Prior to the Closing and effective as of the Closing,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written
estoppel certificate signed by the landlord of each lease for the Leased Real
Property confirming, among other items that may be reasonably requested by
Acquiror, that the lease is in full force and effect and that there are no
breaches or defaults presently existing under the lease, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Acquiror. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure of the
Company to obtain any such written estoppel certificate following the
Companys commercially reasonable efforts to obtain same shall not affect the
Acquirors obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

5.16 _Transferred Business Tax Basis_. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Acquiror a certificate from the Company
reflecting the cumulative tax basis of the assets to be transferred by the
Company to Catalyst pursuant to the Divestiture.

6.1 _Advice of Changes_. Acquiror shall advise the Company as promptly as
practicable in writing of (a) any event, development or circumstances
which has resulted in, or

        

would reasonably be expected to result in, Acquirors or Merger Subs
inability to consummate the Merger or to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement, and (b) any event, development or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions in _Article 8_
not to be satisfied.

  

6.2 _Reasonable Efforts_.

  

(a) _Governmental and Third Party Approvals_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Acquiror agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger, the Divestiture and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority, including all required Antitrust Filings, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties,
and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement and the Divestiture. Subject to Applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent reasonably practicable Acquiror will
consult the Company on, all the information relating to Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with the Merger, the Divestiture and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, Acquiror agrees to make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger and the Divestiture as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within ten business days of the date hereof, and to supply to any
Governmental Authority as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material required under Applicable Law to obtain any
necessary approvals of such Governmental Authority in connection with the
Merger, the Divestiture and/or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including substantially complying with any Request for Additional
Information issued pursuant to applicable antitrust laws) and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions consistent with this _Section 5.6(a)_ necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act

the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all
required approvals or consents of any Governmental Authority (whether
domestic, foreign or supranational).  In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) promptly notify the Company of, and if in writing, furnish the Company
with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the
other orally of) any communications from or with any Governmental Authority
(whether domestic, foreign or supranational) with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permit the
Company to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the

any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to the extent

advance, (iv) furnish the Company with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between it and any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger,
and (v) furnish the Company with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the Company may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any such
Governmental Authority. Acquiror may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
Company under this _Section 6.2_ as "outside counsel only." Such material and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from Acquiror or its legal counsel.

  

(c) _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, Acquiror shall (i) take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Divestiture or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, the
Divestiture and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(d) _Antitrust Restraints_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust
Laws, it is expressly understood and agreed that: (i) Acquiror shall not have
any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding or any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent; and (ii) Acquiror shall be under no
obligation to make proposals, execute or carry out agreements, enter into
consent decrees or submit to orders providing for (A) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment
of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Acquiror or
any of its affiliates or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (B) the
imposition of any limitation or regulation on the ability of Acquiror or any
of its affiliates to freely conduct their business or own such assets, or (C)
the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital Stock or any limitation
or regulation on the ability of Acquiror or any of its affiliates to exercise
full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Capital Stock (any of the
foregoing, an " **Antitrust Restraint** ").

  

6.3 _Confidentiality_. Acquiror and Merger Sub will hold and
keep confidential, and will cause its officers and employees and will direct
its accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
and Affiliates to hold and keep confidential, any nonpublic information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement

        

will remain in full force and effect.

  

6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

  

(a) _"At-will" Employment_.  Acquiror shall make offers of "at-will"
employment (or local, legally required employment agreements), on either a
transitional or permanent basis as determined by the Acquiror, to
substantially all of those persons who are employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. The specific
persons offered employment shall be determined by the Acquiror in its sole
discretion. Such offers of employment shall be effective as of the Effective
Time, upon proof of citizenship or appropriate employment authorization from
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service or the U.S. Department of
State evidencing a right to work in the United States. Such "at-will"
employment arrangements, if accepted by the employee, will supersede any
prior Employment Agreements and other similar contractual arrangements with
such employee in effect prior to the Effective Time except, in the case of
Company Employees located outside the United States, to the extent that
Applicable Law precludes the application of an "at-will" employment
arrangement.  Each employee offered employment by the Acquiror shall have not
less than seven days to consider his or her offer of employment. Each
employee offered employment by Acquiror that becomes an employee of the
Acquiror upon the Effective Time (or remains an employee of the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation) (each, a "
**Continuing Employee** ") shall receive service credit for his or her prior
service with the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries under the Acquirors
flexible time off policy (the " **FTO Plan** "), subject to the limitations on
accrual generally applicable to Acquirors employees under its FTO Plan.
Except as expressly set forth herein, Continuing Employees shall be deemed
new employees of the Acquiror for purposes of benefits, accrual, eligibility
or vesting under the Acquirors benefit plans. From and after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall take all actions as are necessary to allow
Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit programs of Acquiror to
the same extent as similarly situated employees of Acquiror as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time. Each of the Continuing Employees shall
enter into the Acquirors standard agreement regarding confidential and
proprietary information and Acquirors standard form of offer letter subject
to the Closing.

  

6.5 _Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company to each individual who as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a
director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (the "
**Company Indemnified Persons** ") pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (the " **Company
Indemnification Provisions** "), with respect to claims arising out of acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, Acquiror, from and after the Effective Time, shall
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Company
Indemnified Persons with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors
and officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner
that would adversely affect the

        

rights thereunder of the Company Indemnified Persons unless such modification
is required by Applicable Law. In addition, from and after the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Company and the
Surviving Corporation to, pay any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 6.5_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this _Section 6.5_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
Applicable Law and/or a Governmental Authority.

  

(b) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
Acquiror shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
(and any additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered
by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable, when taken
as a whole, than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement
(or Acquiror may substitute therefor policies of insurance, including a
"tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers insurance
policy, providing at least the same coverage with respect to acts and
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time); provided however that
in no event shall Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
an annual premium for any such coverage in excess of 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company under its directors and officers
liability insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, and if the cost
for any such coverage is in excess of such amount, Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation shall only be required to maintain such coverage as is available
for such amount.

  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Person,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract, agreement or
otherwise. The obligations of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 6.5_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Person to whom this
_Section 6.5_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Company Indemnified Person
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Company Indemnified Persons to whom this _Section
6.5_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_).

  

(d) In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

        

ARTICLE 7 
 CLOSING MATTERS

  

7.1 _The Closing_. Subject to termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Article 9_ , the Closing shall take place at the offices of Fenwick and West
LLP, Silicon Valley Center, 801 California Street, Mountain View, California,
on the Closing Date.  Concurrently with the Closing or at such later date and
time as may be mutually agreed in writing by the Company and Acquiror, the
Certificate of Merger shall be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State in
accordance with Delaware Law.

  

7.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Exchange Fund_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall make available to U.S. Bank, National
Association (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for exchange in accordance with this
_Article 2_ , the cash payable pursuant to  _Section 2.1(b)_ , **** in ****
exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock (the " **Exchange Fund** ").

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of certificates or instruments evidencing the Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (collectively, the " **Certificates** ") and which were converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ , (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (that shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for cash. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent (including any
required Form W-9 or Form W-8), the holders of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount of U.S.
dollars that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
 Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only
the right to receive upon surrender thereof a check in the amount of U.S.
dollars that the holders thereof have the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a check in the amount of U.S. dollars that the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ may be paid to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

  

(c) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, a check in the amount of U.S. dollars into which the Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ ; _provided_ , _however_ ,

        

that Acquiror or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such cash, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock for
twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror, upon
demand, and any such holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore
complied with the provisions of this _Section 7.2_ shall thereafter look only
to Acquiror for the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_  as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any
Merger consideration set forth in _Article 2_ hereof that may be payable
upon surrender of any Certificates held by such holders as determined
pursuant to this Agreement without any interest thereon.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Securities_. All cash paid
in accordance with the terms hereof with respect to Company Common Stock
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock, **** and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article 7_. At the close of business on the day on which the

the parties, except (a) as set forth in _Sections 5.8_ and _6.3_
 (Confidentiality), this _Section 9.2_ (Effect of Termination),
_Section 9.3_ (Payments by the Company), as well as _Article 10_

concurrently with the earlier of the consummation of such Alternative
Transaction or the execution of such Contract, as applicable.

  

(b) _Interest and Costs_. The payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.3(a_ ), if any, shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquiror. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that,
without these agreements, Acquiror would not enter into this Agreement.
 Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due

makes a claim that results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the
Company by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall pay
to Acquiror its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amounts set forth in this _Section 9.3_ at the rate of
interest per annum publicly announced by Bank of America as its prime rate,
as in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.  Payment of

incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
_Section 9.2_.

may be amended by the parties at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the occurrence of
the Company Stockholder Approval there may not be, without further approval
of the stockholders of the Company, any amendment of this Agreement that
changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered to the
holders of Company Common Stock hereunder, or which by Applicable Law
otherwise expressly requires the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto and duly approved by the parties
respective Boards of Directors or a duly designated committee thereof.

  

9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party
may, subject to the proviso of _Section 9.4_ (and for this purpose treating
any waiver referred to below as an amendment), (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the
other party hereto with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. Any extension or waiver given in compliance with this
_Section 9.5_ or failure to insist

        

on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.
