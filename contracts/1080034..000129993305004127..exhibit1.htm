AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION    

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this "Agreement"), dated
as of August 10, 2005, is by and among Fastclick, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), ValueClick, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and FC Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition").   

 _RECITALS_     

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition have
each determined that the acquisition of the Company by Parent is advisable to
and fair and in the best interests of their respective corporations and
stockholders;   

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that such acquisition be
accomplished by (a) Parent commencing an exchange offer to acquire all of the
shares of common stock, $.001 par value, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") issued and outstanding (each, a "Share" and, collectively, the
"Shares") in which exchange offer each Share validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn would be exchanged for a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (such amount of
shares, or any greater amount of shares, of Parent Common Stock paid per Share
pursuant to the Offer, the "Offer Consideration"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions provided for in this Agreement (such exchange offer, as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer")
and (b) following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of
Acquisition with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain shares as provided in
Sections 2.8 and 2.9 hereof) will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (as defined below) on the terms and subject to the
conditions provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger");   

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent (on its own behalf and
as the sole stockholder of Acquisition) and Acquisition have each adopted
this Agreement and approved the Merger and the Offer upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and   

WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Offer
and the Merger together qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.   

 _AGREEMENT_     

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Acquisition
hereby agree as follows:   

ARTICLE 1    

THE OFFER    

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.   

(a) Provided that (i) none of the events or circumstances set forth in clauses
(i) through (vi) of _Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred and be existing (and
shall not have been waived by Parent) and (ii) the Company shall have
complied with its applicable obligations under Section 1.2 hereof, Parent
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than
ten (10) business days after the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent may consummate the Offer through Acquisition, its direct wholly
owned subsidiary.   

(b) The obligation of Parent to accept for exchange, and to exchange the Offer
Consideration for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject
only (i) to the satisfaction of the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that,
at the expiration of the Offer, there be validly tendered in accordance with
the terms of the Offer (other than Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred) and not withdrawn that number of
Shares which represents not less than sixty-six and seven-tenths percent
(66.7%) of (A) Shares then outstanding, _plus_ (B) shares of Company Common
Stock which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to Company Stock
Options (as defined below) outstanding on the date hereof which do not
terminate upon consummation of the Offer under Company Plans or otherwise
(the "Fully-Diluted Shares") and (ii) to the satisfaction (or waiver by
Parent) of the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto.
Parent expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions (other
than the Minimum Condition and the conditions set forth in clauses (c), (d)
and (e) of the second paragraph of _Annex A_  hereto and clauses (i)(A) and
(ii) (solely to the extent such clause relates to clause (i)(A)) of  _Annex
A_ hereto), to increase the consideration per Share payable in the Offer and
to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer; _provided, however,_
that no change may be made without the prior written consent of the Company
which decreases the Exchange Ratio for the Offer from that set forth herein,
changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, reduces the
maximum number of Shares sought to be acquired in the Offer, imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to the conditions set forth in _Annex A_
hereto, waives the Minimum Condition, modifies or amends any of the
conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (although such conditions may
be waived as provided herein), makes other changes in the terms of the Offer
that are in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or, except as
provided below, extends the expiration date of the Offer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may (A) extend the Offer beyond the initial
scheduled expiration date, which shall be twenty (20) business days following
the date of commencement of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date" or, as
extended pursuant hereto, the "Expiration Date"), or any subsequent scheduled
expiration date, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of
the conditions to Parents obligation to accept for exchange, and to exchange
the Offer Consideration for, Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to
the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived, subject, however _,_ to the
parties respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 and (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation or interpretation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer. Each extension of the
Offer pursuant to clause (A) of the preceding sentence shall not exceed
the lesser of ten business days (or such longer period as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing in any particular instance) or such fewer number
of days that Parent reasonably believes are necessary to cause the conditions
of the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto to be satisfied;  _provided_ ,
that no such extension or extensions shall occur after the earlier to occur of
(1) the date on which all of the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied
or waived and (2) the Final Date. In addition, if, at the Expiration Date,
all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by this Agreement, waived by Parent) but the number of Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitutes less than
ninety percent (90%) of the Shares then outstanding, without the consent of
the Company, Parent shall have the right (subject to applicable law) to
provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) for up to twenty (20) business days after Parents
acceptance for exchange of the Shares then tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer, in which event Parent shall (1) give the required notice of
such subsequent offering period and (2) immediately accept for exchange, and
promptly exchange the Offer Consideration for, all Shares tendered and not
withdrawn as of such Expiration Date.   

(c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
or earlier waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex A_
hereto as of the Expiration Date, Parent shall accept for exchange, and
exchange the Offer Consideration (subject to subsection (g) below) for, all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
after it is permitted to do so under applicable law.   

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1
prior to acceptance of Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer, Parent
shall, or shall cause Acquisition to, promptly terminate the Offer without
accepting any Shares previously tendered.   

(e) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any such
fractional share interest and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu thereof, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would have been
received by such stockholder) shall, upon surrender of his or her Certificate
or Certificates (as defined below), be entitled to receive an amount of cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the closing price of a share
of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market (the
"NASDAQ") on the first date on which Parent accepts for payment all Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer by (ii) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.
The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in lieu of
issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration, but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying
the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by
the issuance of fractional shares.   

(f) The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (as defined below) will be tendered to Parent pursuant to the
Offer.   

(g) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent shall file with the SEC (i) a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") and (ii) a registration statement on
Form S-4 to register, under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act"), the
offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger
(together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "S-4").
The S-4 shall include a prospectus (the "Prospectus") containing
the information required under Rule 14d-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange
Act. The Schedule TO shall include or contain as an exhibit an offer to
exchange and form of the related letter of transmittal and all other
ancillary Offer documents (collectively with the Prospectus, and together with
all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto and to the Prospectus, the
"Offer Documents"). Parent shall cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated
to the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent with
such information with respect to the Company and its directors, officers and
affiliates as shall be required to be included in the Offer Documents and
S-4. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent shall cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares. In
addition, Parent agrees to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments and to provide the
Company with copies of all such responses, whether written or oral. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence to the SEC or
its staff with respect to, the Offer Documents shall be made by Parent without
providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should become known by Company or Parent, or
Company, Parent or their respective subsidiaries shall take any action, which
should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to either the Offer
Documents or the Schedule 14D-9, as the case may be, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, the party which obtains knowledge
of such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, Company and Parent shall
cooperate to cause an appropriate amendment or supplement to the applicable
SEC filings disclosing such information promptly to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of Company   

(h) Parent agrees (i) to promptly upon the Companys request provide all
information about Parent and Acquisition required to be disclosed in the
Schedule 14D-9, (ii) that all information provided by Parent for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 will not (at the respective
times such materials, or any amendments or supplements thereto, are filed with
the SEC, first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, the
Offer expires or shares of Parent Common Stock are delivered in connection
with the Offer, or at the Effective Time, as the case may be) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and (iii) to promptly correct any information provided by
Parent for the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect.   

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent may withhold Offer Consideration as they reasonably deem
necessary to satisfy their withholding obligations under applicable law, and
the withholding of any such Offer Consideration for such purpose shall be
treated as the payment thereof to the person from whom such amount was
withheld for purposes of determining whether such person received amounts to
which such person is entitled hereunder.   

Section 1.2. _Company Actions_.   

(a) The Company hereby represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of
the Company (the "Company Board"), at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
adopted this Agreement and approved the Offer and the Merger, (ii) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, taken together, are at a price and on terms that
are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and (iii) resolved (subject to Section 5.4 hereof) to recommend
that holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Parent
pursuant thereto. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors described
in the immediately preceding sentence.   

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, the
Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall contain the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company referred to in Section 1.2(a). The
Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the
Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
Parent shall provide the Company with such information with respect to
Parent, Acquisition and their respective directors, officers and affiliates
as shall be required to be included in the Schedule 14D-9 or any information
statement required by Rule 14f-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that it shall be or shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC
and disseminated to holders of Shares. In addition, the Company agrees to
provide Parent and its counsel with any comments, whether written or oral,
that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of
such comments and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether
written or oral. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Schedule 14D-9
shall be made by the Company without providing Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.   

(c) The Company agrees (i) to promptly upon Parents request provide all
information about the Company required to be disclosed in the Offer
Documents, (ii) to promptly deliver to Parent a duly executed consent of the
Companys accountants to allow Parent to include in the S-4 the
Companys financial statements and such accountants report thereon, (iii)
that all information provided by the Company for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents will not (at the respective times such
materials, or any amendments or supplements thereto, are filed with the
SEC, first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, the Offer
expires or shares of Parent Common Stock are delivered in connection with the
Offer, or at the Effective Time, as the case may be) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
(iv) to promptly correct any information provided by the Company for the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect.   

(d) The Company shall, at the request of Parent, cause its transfer agent to
promptly furnish Parent, or cause Parent to be furnished, with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files
containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders
and beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Parent with such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably require in communicating the
Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.   

Section 1.3. _Stockholder Approval_.   

(a) As promptly as practicable following the acquisition of Shares pursuant to
the Offer, if required by applicable law in order to consummate the Merger,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws, in conjunction with Parent, prepare
and file with the SEC a proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") relating to
the Merger and this Agreement and obtain and furnish the information required
by the SEC to be included therein and respond promptly to any comments made
by the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement and cause a
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at
the earliest practicable date. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that it shall be or shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall
cause the Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall provide to
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. In addition,
the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel with any comments, whether
written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such
comments and to provide Parent with copies of all such responses, whether
written or oral. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written
correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the Proxy Statement
shall be made by the Company without providing Parent and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent shall provide
the Company with such information with respect to Parent, Acquisition and
their respective directors, officers and affiliates as shall be required to
be included in the Proxy Statement.   

(b) As promptly as practicable following the SECs review of the preliminary
Proxy Statement, the Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Companys stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") for
the purpose of approving the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement and
shall recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of
such approval and adoption. At the Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall vote,
or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it, Acquisition or any
of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates in favor of such approval and
adoption.   

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent and its
subsidiaries shall acquire in the aggregate at least ninety percent (90%) of
the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto
shall, subject to Article 6 hereof, take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
such acquisition, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.   

Section 1.4. _Top-Up Option_.   

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the Company hereby grants to
Parent an irrevocable, assignable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase up
to that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option Shares")
equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock collectively owned by Parent,
Acquisition and any of their respective affiliates immediately following
consummation of the Offer, shall constitute at least ninety percent (90%) of
the Fully Diluted Shares (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares),
at a purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Consideration,
payable in shares of Parent Common Stock, cash or a demand note in an
amount equal to the value of the Offer Consideration.   

(b) Parent may, at its election, exercise the Top-Up Option, whether in whole
or in part, at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event
and prior to the occurrence of a Top-Up Termination Event (as defined below).
For the purposes hereof, a "Top-Up Exercise Event" shall occur upon Parents
acceptance for payment pursuant to the Offer (including, without limitation,
any subsequent offering that Parent may elect to extend pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement) of Shares constituting, together with
Shares owned directly or indirectly by any other affiliates of Parent, less
than ninety percent (90%) of the Fully-Diluted Shares, but only if (i) the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto would not require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company under NASDAQ rules and regulations
or NASDAQ has granted a waiver from any such rule or regulation that is
reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto, (ii) there is no other
applicable law, rule or regulation that would require the approval of the
Companys stockholders for the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or any such
approval shall have been waived, (iii) there are sufficient Shares available
for issuance under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or available in
the treasury of the Company and (iv) any Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option may be issued pursuant to
a valid exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
any state securities laws. Upon and after the request of Parent, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts (but without the payment of any money)
to obtain such a waiver from NASDAQ as promptly as possible after any such
request. For the purposes hereof, the "Top-Up Termination Date" shall occur
upon the earliest to occur of (A) the Effective Time, (B) the termination of
this Agreement, (C) the date that is ten (10) business days after the
occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event, unless the Top-Up Option has been
previously exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof and
(D) the date that is ten business days after the Top-Up Notice Date (as
defined below), unless the Top-Up Closing shall have previously
occurred.   

(c) If Parent wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall send to the
Company a written notice (a "Top-Up Exercise Notice," and the date of receipt
of which notice is referred to herein as the "Top-Up Notice Date"),
specifying the place for the closing of the purchase and sale of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the "Top-Up Closing") and
a date not earlier than one business day nor later than ten business days
after the Top-Up Notice Date for the Top-Up Closing. The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written
notice to Parent confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the
aggregate purchase price therefor.   

(d) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or
certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares;
_provided_ that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option
Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition
that no provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment,
injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of any such exercise
and (ii) Parent shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company for
the Offer Consideration. Payment by Parent of the purchase price for the Top-
Up Option Shares may be made, at Parents option, by delivery of (A)
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company, (B) a demand note issued by Parent in customary form that is
reasonably acceptable to the parties and in a principal face amount equal to
the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares or (C) shares of Parent
Common Stock. Any demand note issued pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
be accompanied by a credit support arrangement reasonably acceptable to the
parties hereto.   

(e) Upon the delivery by Parent to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice,
and the tender of the consideration described in Section 1.4(d), Parent shall
be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable
upon that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the
Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up
Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Parent or the Company
shall have failed or refused to designate the bank account described in
Section 1.4(d).   

(f) Parent shall pay all expenses, and any and all federal, state and local
stock transfer taxes and other related charges, that may be payable in
connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates
under this Section 1.4.   

(g) Certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may
include legends legally required, including a legend in substantially the
following form:   

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY BE REOFFERED OR SOLD ONLY IF
SO REGISTERED OR IF AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.   

Section 1.5. _Directors_. Promptly upon the acceptance of any Shares for
exchange pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time thereafter as Shares
are acquired pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate
such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board as will give Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board equal to at least that
number of directors which equals the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected
pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate
number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent
(including for purposes of this Section 1.5 such Shares as are accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) bears to the number of Shares outstanding. The
Company shall, upon request by Parent, promptly increase the size of the
Company Board or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors as is necessary to enable Parents designees to be
elected to the Company Board in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.5
and shall cause Parents designees to be so elected; _provided_ ,
that Parents director designees shall be subject to the reasonable approval
of the then-serving directors of the Company, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2 hereof), the Company
Board shall have at least three (3) directors who are directors on the
date hereof and who are neither officers nor employees of the Company nor
designees, stockholders, affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the
Federal securities laws) of Parent (such directors, the "Independent
Directors"). It is the intent of the parties hereto that such Independent
Directors will be the directors who serve as members of the Audit Committee of
the Company Board as of the date hereof, and such Independent Directors will
continue to serve on the Audit Committee of the Company Board and will be
responsible for reviewing any Company filings under the Exchange Act and any
earnings releases of the Company during the interim period between Parents
acceptance of any Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Effective Time. If at
any time or from time to time fewer than three (3) Independent Directors
remain on the Company Board, the other directors shall elect to the Company
Board such number of persons who shall be neither officers nor employees of
the Company nor designees, shareholders, affiliates or associates of Parent
and who shall be reasonably acceptable to any remaining Independent Directors
so that the total of such persons and the remaining Independent Directors
serving on the Company Board is at least three (3). Any such person elected
to the Company Board pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be
an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable
law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.5 and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly after the commencement of the
Offer (or an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to such
Rule 14f-1 if Parent has not theretofore designated directors) such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is
required under such Section 14(f) and such Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill
its obligations under this such Section 1.5. Parent shall supply the Company
any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors
and affiliates required by such Section 14(f) and such Rule 14f-1.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
time directors designated by Parent constitute a majority of the Company Board
and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of the Independent
Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate on behalf of the
Company this Agreement, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or
remedies hereunder or thereunder, (iii) extend the time for performance of
Parents or Acquisitions obligations hereunder or thereunder, (iv) take any
other action required to be taken by the Company Board hereunder or
thereunder or (v) take any other action of the Company Board under or in
connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely
affect holders of Shares other than Parent or Acquisition; _provided_ , that
if there shall be no Independent Directors, then such actions may be effected
by majority vote of the entire Company Board. If at any time the Independent
Directors deem it necessary to consult legal counsel in connection with their
duties as Independent Directors or actions taken, being taken or to be taken
by the Company, the Independent Directors may retain one firm as legal
counsel for such purpose in each such instance, and the Company shall pay, at
the Independent Directors discretion, the reasonable, documented fees and
expenses of any such firm acting as legal counsel incurred in
connection herewith.   

ARTICLE 2    

THE MERGER    

Section 2.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL,

the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Company") and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall
cease.   

Section 2.2. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, a Certificate of Merger substantially
in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the "Certificate of Merger") shall be duly
executed and acknowledged by the Company and thereafter delivered to the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing pursuant to the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as a properly executed copy of
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL or such later time as Parent
and the Company may agree upon and as set forth in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being referred to herein as the
"Effective Time").   

Section 2.3. _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at a time and on a date (the "Closing Date") to
be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second (2nd)
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the latest to occur of the
conditions set forth in Article 6 hereof, at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and
Crutcher LLP, 333 S. Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071, unless
another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.   

Section 2.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall vest
in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company.   

Section 2.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended as
necessary to read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition
in effect at the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable
law; _provided,_ that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the
Corporation is Fastclick, Inc." The bylaws of the Surviving Company shall be
amended as necessary to read the same as the bylaws of Acquisition in effect
at the Effective Time until amended in accordance with applicable law.   

Section 2.6. _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition at the Effective Time
shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company until such directors successor is duly elected or
appointed and qualified.   

Section 2.7. _Officers_. The initial officers of the Surviving Company at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of Acquisition at the Effective Time,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Company until such officers successor is duly
elected or appointed and qualified.   

Section 2.8. _Conversion of Shares_.   

(a) At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares held in the Companys treasury,
(ii) Shares held by Parent or Acquisition or (iii) the Dissenting Shares (as
defined below)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall become the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.10(f) hereof) (collectively, the "Merger Consideration").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the
Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares
then, the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares.   

(b) The "Exchange Ratio" shall be .7928.   

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, $0.01
par value per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Company.   

(d) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share held by Parent, Acquisition or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be
canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be delivered with respect thereto.   

Section 2.9. _Dissenters and Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under
Section 262 of the DGCL in respect of the Merger, then Shares that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
stockholders who have demanded and perfected their demands for appraisal of
such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as
of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their
rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares"), shall not be converted as described in Section 2.8 hereof, but
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted
by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ that, if such holder shall have failed
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right
to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, as described in
Section 2.8 hereof, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (b)
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to
settle, any such demand for payment. Any payment made to the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be made in a manner that is consistent with the
representations pertaining thereto, if any, underlying the Parent 368 Opinion
(as defined in _Annex A_ ) and the Company 368 Opinion (as defined in _Annex
A_ ). Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof to pay for Shares for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.   

Section 2.10. _Exchange of Certificates_.   

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b) and (c) below,
Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust
institution of recognized standing selected by Parent and Acquisition and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit
of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article 2: (i)
certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof and (ii) cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent
Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund"), in exchange for outstanding Shares.   

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") and
whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.8 hereof: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, a
check representing the cash consideration to which such holder may be
entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right of the holder thereof to receive upon such surrender the certificate
representing share of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled as
contemplated by this Section 2.10.   

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no
cash payment in lieu of a fractional share shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.10(f) hereof, until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i) the
amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.10(f) hereof and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.   

(d) In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be
required pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that Parent or the Exchange
Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or
indemnity.   

(e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 2.10(c) or 2.10(f) hereof ) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article 2.   

(f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her
Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying the closing price of a share of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the date of the Effective Time by
the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for
consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes
of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise
be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
stockholders of the Company upon the one year anniversary the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares, as the case may be, and any applicable dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   

(h) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for
shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and as required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent or the Exchange
Agent may withhold Merger Consideration as they reasonably deem necessary to
satisfy their withholding obligations under applicable law, and the
withholding of any such Merger Consideration for such purpose shall be
treated as the payment thereof to the person from whom such amount was
withheld for purposes of determining whether such person received amounts to
which such person is entitled hereunder.   

Section 2.11. _Stock Options_ _._    

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, a
"Company Stock Option" and, collectively, "Company Stock Options") issued
pursuant to the Companys 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive
Plan, 2000 Equity Participation Plan or any other agreement or arrangement,
whether vested or unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into
options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this
Section 2.11. All plans or agreements described above pursuant to which any
Company Stock Option has been issued or may be issued are referred to
collectively as the "Company Plans." At the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including any acceleration in the vesting or exercisability of such option by
reason of this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions or matters
contemplated by this Agreement provided for in such option or the applicable
plan with respect thereto) as were applicable to such Company Stock Option, a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, at a price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (i)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; _provided_ , that in the case
of any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of
its qualification under Section 422 of the Code ("incentive stock options" or
"ISOs"), Parent may cause the option price, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option to be determined so as to comply with Section 424(a) of
the Code.   

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Company Plan and that the agreements
evidencing the grants of such options shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.11
after giving effect to the Merger).   

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Company Stock Options assumed in accordance with this Section 2.11. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to any Company Stock Options and shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.   

(d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company and/or the Company Board
shall take all action necessary to give effect to the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.11.   

Section 2.12. _Plan of Reorganization_. The parties hereto hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code.   

ARTICLE 3    

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition,
subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Letter previously
delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Disclosure Letter") and certified by
a duly authorized officer of the Company (which exceptions shall specifically
identify the Section, subsection or paragraph, as applicable, to which
such exception relates), that:   

Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries;
Investments_.   

(a) Section 3.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, a true and complete list of each person (as defined below) in
which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, fifty percent (50%) or more
of the voting interests or of which the Company otherwise has the right to
direct the management (each, a "Subsidiary") together with the jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary and the percentage of
each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or other equity interests owned
directly or indirectly by the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(a)
of the Disclosure Letter, all the outstanding capital stock or other
ownership interests of each Subsidiary is owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, free and clear of any Lien (as defined below) or any other
limitation or restriction. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company has delivered to
Parents counsel accurate and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as in
full force and effect on the date hereof, of the Company and each Subsidiary.
Other than as specified in Section 3.1(a) of the Disclosure Letter, the
Company has no operating Subsidiaries other than those incorporated in a
state of the United States.   

(b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, does not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. For purposes hereof, the term "Material Adverse Effect on the
Company" means any circumstance involving, change in or effect on the Company
or any Subsidiary (i) that is, or is reasonably likely in the future to be,
materially adverse to the business, operations, earnings or results
of operations, assets or liabilities (including contingent liabilities), the
financial condition or prospects of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, excluding from the foregoing any event, change or circumstance
arising out of (A) the compliance by the Company, the Subsidiaries, Parent or
Acquisition with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (B) changes in
applicable law or regulations or in United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") or (C)(x) changes in economic conditions in
the online advertising business generally and (y) changes in regulatory
conditions in the online advertising business, except, in the case of clauses
(C)(x) and (C)(y), to the extent such changes have a materially
disproportionate effect on the Company relative to other participants in the
online advertising business, or (ii) that is reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as specifically set
forth in this Agreement, all references to Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or its Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to
refer solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries without including
its ownership by Parent after the Merger.   

(c) Section 3.1(c) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete
list, as of the date hereof, of each equity investment made by the Company or
any Subsidiary in any person (including the percentage ownership, purchase
price and any management rights granted to the Company or any such
Subsidiary) other than the Subsidiaries ("Other Interests"). The
Other Interests are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and
clear of all Liens.   

Section 3.2. _Capitalization of the Company and Subsidiaries_.   

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of One Hundred
Million (100,000,000) shares of Company Common Stock, of which, as of August
10, 2005, Nineteen Million Six Hundred Sixty-One Thousand Seven Hundred

would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary knows of, or has received notice of, the
existence of any event or condition which constitutes, or, after notice or
lapse of time or both, will constitute, a default, event of default or other
breach on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such

Effect on the Company and that have not resulted in, and could not reasonably
be expected to result in, any injunction or other equitable remedy being
imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each of
the Company and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the

other equitable remedy being imposed on the Company or any Subsidiary
that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries are

to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and that have not
resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, any injunction

that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Disclosure

no officer, director or employee of the Company has committed a breach of any
fiduciary responsibility or obligation imposed by Title I of ERISA. Other

United States Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, against
such Employee Plan or the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

Affiliate is a party, and no employee, officer or director of the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate will become entitled to severance, termination allowance
or similar payments, by reason of entering into or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events). Except as provided
in Section 3.11(c) of the Disclosure Letter, no payment or benefit which will
or may be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

Surviving Company, the Company, its ERISA Affiliates or Parent or any of its
respective affiliates with respect to any "disqualified individual" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) will be characterized as a
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code).   

(d) No Employee Plan that is a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of
Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits to former employees of the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates, other than as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state laws. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
and Sections 4980B, 9801, 9802, 9811 and 9812 of the Code.

No strikes, work stoppage, grievance, claim of unfair labor practice or labor
dispute against the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has occurred, is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, threatened, and,
to the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, there is no basis
for any of the foregoing. To the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates, there is no organizational activity being made or threatened
by or on behalf of any labor union with respect to any employees of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

extent permitted by applicable law and the applicable Employee Plan, each
Employee Plan (other than any stock option plan) can be amended or terminated
at any time, without consent from any other party and without liability other
than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination
(other than charges incurred as a result of such termination).   

(h) To the knowledge of the Company and its ERISA Affiliates, no key employee,
or group of employees, of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has expressed to

respects with all laws relating to the employment of labor,
including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, equal opportunity and
collective bargaining.

Company has no commitment, intention or understanding to create, terminate or
adopt any Employee Plan that would result in any additional liability to the

benefits under or the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan from the
level of benefits or expense incurred for the most recently completed fiscal
year of such Employee Plan other than the cost of additional benefits accrued
in accordance with the terms of such Employee Plan.

policies of the Company and any Subsidiary in respect of any of the Company
Products which are currently in effect (the "Warranty Obligations"), and the

warranties, guarantees and warranty policies of or relating to the Company
Products and services.   

True and correct copies of all forms of Warranty Obligations have been
delivered to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement. There have not
been any material deviations from the Warranty Obligations, and salespersons,
employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not authorized
to undertake obligations to any customer or other person in excess of or
materially different from such Warranty Obligations. The Financial Statements
reflect adequate and appropriate reserves for all Warranty Obligations. All
products designed, licensed, or sold by the Company and its Subsidiaries are

respects the written requirements therefor set forth in any and all contracts,
agreements, purchase orders, Warranty Obligations or other specifications or
agreements related thereto.

misleading.   

Section 3.29. _Insurance_. All insurance policies of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are listed on Section 3.29 of the Disclosure Letter. Except as
set forth in Section 3.29 of the Disclosure Letter, there is no material
claim pending under any such policies as to which coverage has been
questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of or obligors on such
policies. All premiums due and payable under all such policies have been
timely paid and the Company and its Subsidiaries are otherwise in compliance
with the terms of such policies. The Company has no knowledge of any
threatened termination of, or material premium increase with respect to, any
of such policies, or that any underwriter or carrier would not renew each
such policy on substantially comparable terms as currently in effect.   

Section 3.30. _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_. Neither the Company, nor to
the knowledge of the Company, any Subsidiary, agent, employee or other person
associated with or acting on behalf of the Company has, directly or
indirectly, used any corporate funds for unlawful contributions, gifts,
entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating to political activity,

of 1977, as amended, or made any bribe, rebate, payoff, influence
payment, kickback or other similar unlawful payment.   

Section 3.31. _Internal Controls_. The Company maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company (a) maintains
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries is made known to the
management of the Company by others within those entities and (b) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies in the operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect the

employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal controls.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF    

PARENT AND ACQUISITION   

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
      Parent and Acquisition hereby represent and warrant to the Company
that: 
  
  



  |   |   
  

Section 4.1. 

  |   | Organization.  
  

 

  |   |   
   

   

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition and Parents other subsidiaries is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and each has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on
its businesses as now being conducted, except, solely with respect to
Parents subsidiaries other than Acquisition, where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing or the failure to have such power and
authority, individually or in the aggregate, does not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. Parent has heretofore delivered to the Companys counsel
accurate and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws,
as currently in full force and effect, of Acquisition.   

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition is duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, does not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent. For purposes hereof, the term "Material Adverse Effect on
Parent" means any circumstance involving, change in or effect on Parent or
any of its subsidiaries (i) that is, or is reasonably likely in the future
to be, materially adverse to the business operations, earnings, results of
operations, assets or liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or the
financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but
excluding from the foregoing any event, change or circumstance arising out of
(A) the compliance by the Company, Subsidiaries, Parent or Acquisition with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (B) the announcement or
disclosure of this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, (C) any
stockholder class action litigation arising directly out of allegations of a
breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement or (D) changes in
applicable law or regulations or in GAAP; or (ii) that is reasonably likely
to prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Acquisition
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
specifically set forth in this Agreement, all references to Material
Adverse Effect on Parent contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to refer
solely to Parent and its subsidiaries without including its ownership of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Merger.   

Section 4.2. _Capitalization of Parent and its Subsidiaries_.   

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of (i) 500,000,000 shares
of Parent Common Stock, $.001 par value per share, of which, as of August 10,
2005, approximately Eighty-Four Million One Hundred Thirty-One Thousand One
Hundred Sixty-Nine (84,131,169) shares were issued and outstanding,
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value per share, none of which
are outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have
been validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to any
preemptive rights, and all shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to
this Agreement will be, when issued, duly authorized and validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights.
As of August 10, 2005 (A) an aggregate of approximately Seven Million Six
Hundred Sixty-Eight Thousand Six Hundred Twenty-Nine (7,668,629) shares of
Parent Common Stock were issuable upon or otherwise deliverable in
connection with the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and under
purchase plans. Except as set forth above, as of the date hereof, there are
outstanding (1) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of
Parent, (2) no securities of Parent or its subsidiaries convertible into,
or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock or voting securities of Parent,
(3) no options, warrants or other rights to acquire from Parent or its
subsidiaries and no obligations of Parent or its subsidiaries to issue any
capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of Parent and (4) no
equity equivalent interests in the ownership or earnings of Parent or any
subsidiaries of Parent or other similar rights. All of the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock, options and warrants to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock (collectively, "Parent Securities") were issued in compliance
with the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. As of the date
hereof, other than in connection with Parents authorized stock repurchase
program, there are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
Parent Securities. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or
other arrangements or understandings to which Parent is a party or by which
it or the Parent Board is bound, and, to Parents knowledge, there are no
other agreements, voting trusts or other arrangements or understandings
relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of Parent. No shares of Parent are issued and held by Parent in
its treasury as of the date hereof.   

(b) The Parent Common Stock constitutes the only class of securities of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries registered or required to be registered under the
Exchange Act.   

Section 4.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement_.   

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by
the Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board"), the Board of Directors
of Acquisition and by Parent as the sole stockholder of Acquisition. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent
and Acquisition and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
hereof by the Company, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of
each of Parent and Acquisition enforceable against each of Parent and
Acquisition in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency (including all applicable laws relating to fraudulent
transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to creditors rights generally or to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).   

(b) The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Offer and the Merger) are fair to and in the best interests of Parents
stockholders and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement have been duly and validly adopted
and approved by Parents Board of Directors and Parent as Acquisitions sole
stockholder. No other corporate proceedings of Parent or Acquisition are
required to authorize this Agreement and consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   

Section 4.4. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.   

(a) Parent has filed all required forms, reports and documents with the SEC
since January 1, 2004 ("Parent SEC Reports"), and each of such Parent SEC
Reports complied at the time of filing in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
applicable, in each case as in effect on the dates such forms, reports and
documents were filed. None of the Parent SEC Reports, including any financial
statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference therein,
contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading, except to the extent
superseded by a Parent SEC Report filed subsequently and prior to the date
hereof. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any related notes and schedules thereto) contained in the Parent
SEC Reports (the "Parent Financial Statements") do not contain any items of
special or nonrecurring revenue or any other income not earned in the
ordinary course of business except as expressly stated therein. The Parent
Financial Statements have been prepared in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied and maintained throughout the periods
indicated, except where noted therein, and fairly present the consolidated
financial condition of Parent and its subsidiaries at their respective dates
and the results of their operations and changes in financial position for
the periods covered thereby, in each case in conformity with GAAP (subject,
in each case, to normal year-end adjustments and except that unaudited
financial statements do not contain all footnotes required for audited
financial statements).   

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of any
amendment or modification (that has not yet been filed with the SEC, but that
Parent presently intends to file) to agreements, documents or other
instruments previously filed by Parent with the SEC.   

Section 4.5. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in (i) the S-4 will at the time the S-4 is filed with the SEC and at the time
it becomes effective under the Securities Act contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
Schedule 14D-9 or Offer Documents will, at the respective times such
materials, or any amendments or supplements thereto, are filed with the SEC,
first published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, the Offer
expires or shares of Parent Common Stock are delivered in connection with
the Offer, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they are
made not misleading. The S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representation, warranty or covenant with respect to any information supplied
or required to be supplied by the Company which is contained in or omitted
from any of the foregoing documents or which is incorporated by
reference therein.   

Section 4.6. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for filings,
permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under and
other applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state
securities or "blue sky" laws, the HSR Act and any filings under similar
merger notification laws or regulations of foreign Governmental Entities
and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by
the DGCL, no filing with or notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent
or approval of any Governmental Entity is necessary for the execution and
delivery by Parent or Acquisition of this Agreement or the consummation by
Parent or Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquisition nor the consummation by Parent or Acquisition of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the respective Certificates of Incorporation or bylaws of
Parent or Acquisition; (ii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien)
under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Acquisition or any of Parents other
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound; or (iii) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent,
Acquisition or any of Parents other subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, except, in the case of the foregoing clause (ii) or
(iii), for violations, breaches or defaults that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   

Section 4.7. _No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes_. Except as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, neither
Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and
its consolidated subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), other than
liabilities and obligations incurred since March 31, 2005 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices. Except as disclosed in the
Parent SEC Reports, since March 31, 2005, there has been no Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.   

Section 4.8. _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses (collectively, the "Parent Permits"), except
where failures to hold such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent and that have not resulted in, and could
not reasonably be expected to result in, any injunction or other equitable
remedy being imposed on Parent or any of its subsidiaries that, individually
or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each
of Parent and its subsidiaries is in compliance with the terms of the Parent
Permits held by it, except where the failure so to comply, individually or in
the aggregate, would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and
that have not resulted in, and could not reasonably be expected to result in,
any injunction or other equitable remedy being imposed on Parent or any
of its subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The business of Parent and its
subsidiaries are being conducted in compliance with all applicable laws,
ordinances and regulations of the United States or any foreign country or
any political subdivision thereof or of any Governmental Entity, except for
violations or possible violations of any such laws, ordinances or regulations
that, individually or in the aggregate, do not and will not result in a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent and that have not resulted in, and could
not reasonably be expected to result in, any injunction or other equitable
remedy being imposed on Parent or any of its subsidiaries that, individually
or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.   

Section 4.9. _Brokers_. No broker finder or investment banker is entitled to
any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition.   

Section 4.10. _No Prior Activities of Acquisition_. Acquisition was formed for
the purposes of entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby, and has engaged in no other business
activities of any type or kind whatsoever.   

Section 4.11. _Tax Treatment_. Neither Parent nor, to Parents knowledge, any
of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take action that would prevent the
Offer and the Merger together from qualifying as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code.   

Section 4.12. _Disclosure_. Parent has provided to the Company copies of all
existing material contracts (as used in this Section 4.12, as that term is
defined for purposes of Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K promulgated under
the Exchange Act) of Parent or its subsidiaries that are not yet required to
be filed, but will be filed as an exhibit to a report filed by Parent
with the SEC after the date hereof. Parent has informed the Company of each
letter of intent executed by Parent or any of its subsidiaries that would
likely result in a material contract of Parent.   

Section 4.13. _Off Balance Sheet Liabilities_ Except for transactions,
arrangements and other relationships otherwise specifically identified in the
Parent Financial Statements as of the date hereof, there are no transactions,
arrangements and other relationships between and/or among Parent, any of its
affiliates and any special purpose or limited purpose entity beneficially
owned by or formed at the direction of Parent or any of its affiliates.   

Section 4.14. _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports, no
suits, claims, actions, proceedings or investigations would, if decided

subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Entity.   

Section 4.15. _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. As of the date hereof,
Parent owns no shares of Company Common Stock and has not owned any shares of
Company Common Stock within the past three (3) years. No subsidiary of
Parent, including Acquisition, owns any shares of Company Common Stock or has
owned any shares within the past three (3) years. Parent has not taken
any action in its capacity as a stockholder of Company that would cause
Section 203 of the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement or the
Merger.

is necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and any other
transactions contemplated thereby. Parent shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the Company copies of any written comments,
and advise the Company of any oral comments or communications regarding the

with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the S-4 prior to filing the same with the SEC, and Parent shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment
or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the S-4 shall be
made by Parent without the approval of the Company, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , that with respect to
documents filed by Parent which are incorporated by reference in the S-4, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the Company or its
business, financial condition or results of operations. Parent shall also (i)
take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction
in which it is now not so qualified) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger and upon the exercise of Company
Stock Options and (ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals

in obtaining such permits and approvals as reasonably requested. The Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of
Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.   

(b) Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any

issuable in connection with the Offer or the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction or any request by the SEC for amendment of the S-4.
Following the time the S-4 is declared effective, Parent shall file the final
prospectus included therein under Rule 424(b) promulgated pursuant to the

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should become known by Company or Parent, or Company, Parent or
their respective subsidiaries shall take any action, which should
be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the S-4 so that such the S-4
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the party which
obtains knowledge of such information shall promptly notify the other party
hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, Company and
Parent shall cooperate to cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
disclosing such information promptly to be filed with the SEC and

Section 5.4. _Other Potential Acquirers_.   

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition" means the
occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the acquisition by any person
(as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than
Parent or any of its affiliates (a "Third Party") of any portion of the
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, representing
fifteen percent (15%) of more of the aggregate fair market value of the
Companys business immediately prior to such acquisition, other than the sale
or license of products in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practices; (ii) the acquisition by a Third Party of fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the outstanding Shares; (iii) the adoption by the
Company of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or payment of an
extraordinary dividend (whether in cash or other property); (iv) the
repurchase by the Company or any Subsidiary of more than fifteen percent (15%)
of the outstanding Shares; or (v) the acquisition by the Company or any
Subsidiary by merger, purchase of stock or assets, joint venture or otherwise
of a direct or indirect ownership interest or investment in any person or
business whose annual revenues or assets is equal to or greater than fifteen
percent (15%) of the annual revenues or assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for and at the twelve (12) month period ended
March 31, 2005. For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any
bona fide proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly in one or a series of
related transactions contemplated by a proposed single agreement,
for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, eighty percent (80%)
or more of the Shares then outstanding or eighty percent (80%) or more of the
fair market value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
otherwise on terms that the Company Board by a majority vote determines in
its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel
to the Company and the Company Financial Adviser or another financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable to the Companys
stockholders than the Merger.   

(b) The Company agrees that it and its affiliates and their respective
officers, directors and employees shall, and that it shall direct its
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives and
agents to immediately cease any existing activities, discussions
or negotiations with any other persons with respect to any possible Third
Party Acquisition. Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates shall, nor
shall the Company authorize or permit any of its or their respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
or other representatives and agents to, directly or indirectly, (A)
encourage, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate the submission of any
proposal for a Third Party Acquisition; (B) participate in or initiate any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public
information with respect to, the Company or any Subsidiary or their
respective businesses, assets or properties (other than Parent and
Acquisition or any designees of Parent and Acquisition) in connection
with, or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any Third Party
Acquisition or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Third Party Acquisition; or (C)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Third Party
Acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.4 or
any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Third Party that makes an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal for
a Third Party Acquisition, if and to the extent that (1) the Company Board,
by a majority vote, determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation
with independent legal counsel, that failure to do so would constitute or
result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable law, (2) the Company Board, by a
majority vote, reasonably determines in good faith that such proposal for a
Third Party Acquisition constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal which, if accepted, is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the Third Party making the proposal and (3) prior
to taking such action, (x) the Company provides two (2) business days prior
written notice to Parent to the effect that it is proposing to take such
action and (y) receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement in reasonably customary form and in any event containing terms at
least as stringent as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.   

(c) The Company shall promptly (but in no case later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent if the Company, any Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers or other employees, directors, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants or other representatives or agents receives any
proposal or inquiry concerning a Third Party Acquisition or request for
nonpublic information by any person who is making, or who has indicated that
it is considering making, a proposal for a Third Party Acquisition, including
all material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person
submitting such proposal. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any
written proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or amendments or supplements
thereto, and shall thereafter promptly provide to Parent such information as
is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed of the status of any
inquiries, discussions or negotiations with such person proposing the Third
Party Acquisition, and any material changes to the terms and conditions of
such proposal for a Third Party Acquisition, and shall promptly provide to
Parent a copy of any information delivered to such person which has not
previously been made available to Parent.   

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(d), the Company Board shall not
withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, or propose to withdraw or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent, such recommendation or approve or recommend any
Third Party Acquisition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Parents
acceptance of Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer, if (i) the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written proposal for a Third Party
Acquisition that the Company Board, by a majority vote, reasonably determines
in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal which, if accepted, is
likely to be consummated taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal and the Third Party making the proposal and
(ii) the Company Board by a majority vote determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with independent legal counsel, that failure to
do so would constitute or result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, the
Company Board may withdraw or adversely modify its recommendation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or recommend a Superior
Proposal, but in each case only (A) after providing written notice to
Parent advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal (a "Notice
of Superior Proposal"), (B) after the Company Board considers in good faith
any proposed changes to this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent and (C)
if Parent does not, within five (5) business days after Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board by a
majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (after receiving the
advice of the Company Financial Advisor or another financial adviser of
nationally recognized reputation) to be at least as favorable to the
Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be entitled to enter into an agreement with respect to
a Superior Proposal unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1 hereof and the Company has paid all amounts due to Parent
pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof.   

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any disclosure that the
Company Board may be required to make with respect to the receipt of a
proposal for a Third Party Acquisition or any other matter in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the Exchange Act shall
not constitute a violation of this Agreement; _provided_ that, other than as
required by applicable law, such disclosure states that no action will be
taken by the Company Board in violation of Section 5.4(d) hereof.   

(f) Except as provided in Article 7 hereof, nothing in this Section 5.4 shall
permit the Company to terminate this Agreement or affect any other
obligations of the Company under this Agreement.   

Section 5.5. _Nasdaq Listing_ _._ Parent shall use its best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer and the Merger
and the shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance upon
exercise of Company Stock Options to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the issuance of such shares
pursuant to the Offer or the Effective Time, as the case may be.   

Section 5.6. _Access to Information_.

and will cause its officers and those of the Subsidiaries to furnish Parent
and its authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business and properties of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably request.
Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent shall make available
to the Company, as reasonably requested by the Company, a designated and
appropriate officer of Parent to answer questions and make available such
information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries as is reasonably requested
by the Company, taking into account the nature of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) Between the date hereof and the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time, the Company
shall furnish to Parent (i) within two (2) business days following

Company with respect to such financial statements. All the foregoing shall be
in accordance with the books and records of the Company and shall fairly
present its financial position (taking into account the differences between
the monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements prepared by the
Company in conformity with its past practices) as of the last day of the
period then ended.   

(c) Between the date hereof and the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Effective Time, Parent shall
furnish to the Company (i) within two (2) business days following preparation
thereof (and in any event within twenty (20) business days after the end of
each calendar month, commencing with July 2005), an unaudited balance sheet as
of the end of such month and the related statement of earnings, (ii) within
two (2) business days following preparation thereof (and in any event within
twenty (20) business days after the end of each fiscal quarter) an unaudited
balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and the related statements of
earnings, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for the quarter then
ended and (iii) within two (2) business days following preparation thereof
(and in any event within ninety (90) calendar days after the end of each

clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP in
conformity with the practices consistently applied by Parent with respect to
such financial statements. All the foregoing shall be in accordance with the
books and records of Parent and shall fairly present its financial position
(taking into account the differences between the monthly, quarterly and

practices) as of the last day of the period then ended.   

(d) Each of the parties hereto shall hold, and shall cause its consultants and
advisers to hold, in confidence all documents and information furnished to it
by or on behalf of another party to this Agreement in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of that
certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 17, 2005, between the Company
and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, any party to this Agreement (and their employees,
representatives, or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating
to such tax treatment and tax structure;  _provided_ , that this sentence
shall not permit any disclosure that otherwise is prohibited by
this Agreement (i) if such disclosure would result in a violation of federal
or state securities laws; or (ii) to the extent not related to the tax
aspects of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Moreover, nothing
in this Agreement shall be construed to limit in any way any partys ability
to consult any tax advisor regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

Section 5.7. _Certain Filings; Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all action and
to do or cause to be done all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
all commercially reasonable efforts to do the following: (i) cooperate in the
preparation and filing of the Offer Materials, the Schedule 14D-9 and the S-4
and any amendments thereto and any filings that may be required under the HSR
Act and similar merger notification laws or regulations of foreign
Governmental Entities; (ii) obtain consents of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) contest any legal

necessary action.

consult with the other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except (a) as may be required by applicable law or by the rules
and regulations of, or pursuant to any listing agreement with the NASDAQ, as
determined by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or (b) following a
change, if any, of the Company Boards recommendation of the Merger (solely
in accordance with Section 5.4(d) hereof), after which event no such
consultation shall be required. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
first public announcement of this Agreement and the Merger shall be a joint
press release agreed upon by Parent and the Company.   

Section 5.9. _Indemnification and Directors  and Officers Insurance_.   

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless (and shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
to), to the extent not covered by insurance, each person who is now or has
been prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
Persons") against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
counsel fees and expenses), settlement, payments or liabilities arising out
of or in connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part
out of the fact that such person is or was an officer or director of the
Company or any Subsidiary, whether or not pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether or not asserted or
claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time ("Indemnified
Liabilities"); and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent
required or permitted under applicable law. Nothing contained herein shall
make Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the Surviving Company an insurer, a
co-insurer or an excess insurer in respect of any insurance policies which
may provide coverage for Indemnified Liabilities, nor shall this Section 5.9
relieve the obligations of any insurer in respect thereto. The parties
hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.9 shall apply without
limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person. Each
Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section
5.9 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 5.9 shall not limit
or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person may have
under any agreement with the Company or under the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws as presently in effect. Parent shall cause
the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company to
maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the current provisions contained in the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws of the Company regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses.   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers as of or prior to the date hereof and
any indemnification provisions under the Companys Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date hereof.   

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each person entitled to indemnification
hereunder and the heirs and representatives of such person and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.
Parent shall not permit the Surviving Company to merge or consolidate with
any other person or transfer or convey all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person unless the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.   

(d) The Company shall purchase within twenty-eight (28) days after the
Expiration Date run-off or "tail" insurance coverage under its existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies, or from another
insurer, that provides coverage, for a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, for the Companys directors and officers for claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at, or prior to, the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the
"DandO Insurance"). The DandO Insurance shall be substantially equivalent to the
Companys existing policies, or if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, that the
aggregate cost for the purchase of such DandO Insurance (for the entire six (6)
"year tail" coverage period) shall not exceed $1,800,000.   

Section 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall provide
prompt notice to Parent and Acquisition, and Parent and Acquisition shall
provide prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which has caused or would be
likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
become untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent
or Acquisition, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 5.10 shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   

Section 5.11. _Affiliates_.   

(a) The Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as
soon as practicable from all stockholders of the Company who may be
affiliates of the Company or Parent pursuant to Rule 145 under the Securities
Act ("Company Affiliates"), after the date of this Agreement and on or prior
to the Effective Time, a letter agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit B_.   

(b) Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 for
the purpose of resale by Company Affiliates of shares of Parent Common
Stock.   

Section 5.12. _Tax-Free Reorganization_. Each of Parent and Company shall
provide to Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP (or such other counsel that has been
selected to render the Parent 368 Opinion) and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris,
Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. (or such other counsel that has been selected to
render the Company 368 Opinion) a certificate containing
representations reasonably requested by such counsel in connection with
rendering the Parent 368 Opinion or Company 368 Opinion, as the case may be.
Each of Parent and Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the Parent 368 Opinion or the Company 368 Opinion, as the case may be,
and to cause the conditions relating to the receipt of such opinions that are
set forth in _Annex A_  and Section 6.1(g) hereof to be satisfied (except to
the extent waived as provided therein).   

Section 5.13. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall adopt resolutions consistent with the SECs interpretations of
Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act so that the cancellations of Company Options
held by Company Insiders pursuant to this Agreement shall be exempt
transactions for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the greatest
extent possible. For purposes of this Section 5.13, a "Company Insider" is
any officer or director of the Company, or any beneficial holder of more than
10% of the Shares.   

Section 5.14. _Takeover Statutes_. If any anti-takeover or similar statute
or regulation is or may become applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the parties and its Board of Directors shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to grant or secure any required consents
or approvals and take all such actions as are reasonable and
legally permissible so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects (including any resulting
delays) of any such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.   

Section 5.15. _Company Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not cause the acceleration of any Company Stock Options.   

Section 5.16. _Post-Closing Employee Benefits_. Following the Effective Time,
and to the extent that any Employee Plan is not continued after the Effective
Time, Parent shall or shall cause either the Company or Acquisition, as
applicable, to make available to the employees of the Company who continue
employment with Parent, Company or Acquisition (including any successor
to Parent, Company or Acquisition), as applicable, upon or after the
Effective Time, comparable employee benefit plans and programs maintained for
similarly situated employees of Parent on the same terms and conditions
applicable to similarly situated employees of Parent..

Section 7.2. _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect without any liability on the part of any party
hereto, or any of its respective affiliates, directors, officers or
stockholders, other than the provisions of this Section 7.2 and
Sections 5.6(d) and 7.3, and all of Article 8, except for Section 8.10.
Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party from liability
for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.   

Section 7.3. _Fees and Expenses_.   

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:   

(i) Section 7.1(c)(iv), 7.1(d)(iii), 7.1(d)(iv), 7.1(d)(v) or 7.1(d)(vi);
or   

(ii) Section 7.1(d)(i) or 7.1(d)(ii) as a result of a willful and knowing
breach by the Company if (x) prior to the time of such termination pursuant
to Section 7.1(d)(i) or 7.1(d)(ii) the Company has received a proposal for a
Third Party Acquisition and (y) within six (6) months after such termination,
(A) the Company enters into an agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition or (B) a transaction constituting a Company Acquisition
occurs;   

Parent and Acquisition would suffer direct and substantial damages, which
damages cannot be determined with reasonable certainty. To compensate Parent
and Acquisition for such damages, the Company shall pay to Parent as
liquidated damages immediately upon the occurrence of the event described in
this Section 7.3(a) giving rise to such damages the sum of (i) Six Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,500,000) and (ii) an amount equal to the
aggregate of all expenses undertaken by Parent in connection with the
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder (such amount referred to in this clause (ii) not to
exceed Two Million One Hundred and Fifty Thousand dollars ($2,150,000) (such
sum referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), the "Termination Fee"). In the event
that any Exchanging Holder pays the Exchange Agreement Termination Fee (as
defined in Section 4.14 of certain of the Exchange Agreements) in full to
Parent, the Company shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee to Parent
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that, unless and until an Exchanging Holder has
actually paid to Parent an Exchange Agreement Termination Fee, the Companys
obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) shall be
a separate, direct obligation to Parent and shall be absolute and
unconditional, and it shall not be a defense to such obligation that an
Exchanging Holder is (or may be) obligated to pay an Exchange Agreement
Termination Fee to Parent. Except for claims or causes of action based on
fraud, in the event that the Termination Fee is paid as required herein, such
Termination Fee payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect
to such termination and all matters arising out of or in connection with or
in any way related to such termination or matters and neither Parent
nor Acquisition nor their stockholders shall be entitled to any further or
other rights, claims or remedies. It is specifically agreed that the amount
to be paid pursuant to this Section 7.3(a) represents liquidated damages and
not a penalty. The Company hereby waives any right to set-off or counterclaim
against such amount.   

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean any of
the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company
immediately preceding such transaction hold less than eighty percent (80%) of
the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting person of such
transaction, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company or any material
Subsidiary of assets representing in excess of twenty percent (20%) of
the aggregate fair market value of the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such sale or (iii) the
acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an
exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly,
of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
of capital stock representing in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.   

(c) Except as provided in this Section 7.3, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except that fees and expenses incurred in connection with (i) the
filing, printing and mailing of the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and
the S-4 (including the Prospectus) and (ii) any filings required under the
HSR Act and similar foreign merger notification laws shall be shared equally
by the Company and Parent.   

Section 7.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Acquisition. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Letter) may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
the parties hereto.   

Section 7.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in
any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (c)
waive compliance by another party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument, in
writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.
