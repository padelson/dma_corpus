<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;), dated as of August
10, 2005, is by and among Fastclick, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;), ValueClick,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), and FC Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B>Acquisition</B>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U><B>RECITALS</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition have each determined
that the acquisition of the Company by Parent is advisable to and fair and in the best interests of
their respective corporations and stockholders;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that such acquisition be accomplished by (a)
Parent commencing an exchange offer to acquire all of the shares of common stock, $.001 par value,
of the Company (&#147;<B>Company Common Stock</B>&#148;) issued and outstanding (each, a &#147;<B>Share</B>&#148; and, collectively,
the &#147;<B>Shares</B>&#148;) in which exchange offer each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn would
be exchanged for a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of Parent (&#147;<B>Parent Common Stock</B>&#148;), equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (such
amount of shares, or any greater amount of shares, of Parent Common Stock paid per Share pursuant
to the Offer, the &#147;<B>Offer Consideration</B>&#148;), on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for
in this Agreement (such exchange offer, as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this
Agreement, the &#147;<B>Offer</B>&#148;) and (b)&nbsp;following the consummation of the Offer, the merger of Acquisition
with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving corporation, in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;<B>DGCL</B>&#148;), pursuant to which Shares (other than certain shares
as provided in Sections&nbsp;2.8 and 2.9 hereof) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (as defined below) on the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this
Agreement (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent (on its own behalf and as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition) and Acquisition have each adopted this Agreement and approved the
Merger and the Offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes it is intended that the Offer and the Merger
together qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<B>Code</B>&#148;), and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this
Agreement constitute a &#147;plan of reorganization&#148; for purposes of Sections&nbsp;354 and 361 of the Code.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><U><B>AGREEMENT</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the Company, Parent and Acquisition hereby agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE 1</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>THE OFFER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;1.1. <U>The Offer</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Provided that (i)&nbsp;none of the events or circumstances set forth in clauses (i)&nbsp;through
(vi)&nbsp;of <U>Annex A</U> hereto shall have occurred and be existing (and shall not have been waived
by Parent) and (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall have complied with its applicable obligations under Section
1.2 hereof, Parent shall commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;<B>Exchange Act</B>&#148;)) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, but in no event later than ten (10)&nbsp;business days after the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent may consummate the Offer through Acquisition, its direct wholly owned
subsidiary.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The obligation of Parent to accept for exchange, and to exchange the Offer Consideration
for, Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only (i)&nbsp;to the satisfaction of the
condition (the &#147;<B>Minimum Condition</B>&#148;) that, at the expiration of the Offer, there be validly tendered
in accordance with the terms of the Offer (other than Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery where
actual delivery has not occurred) and not withdrawn that number of Shares which represents not less
than sixty-six and seven-tenths percent (66.7%) of (A)&nbsp;Shares then outstanding, <I>plus </I>(B)&nbsp;shares of
Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to Company Stock Options
(as defined below) outstanding on the date hereof which do not terminate upon consummation of the
Offer under Company Plans or otherwise (the &#147;<B>Fully-Diluted Shares</B>&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;to the satisfaction
(or waiver by Parent) of the other conditions set forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto. Parent
expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions (other than the Minimum Condition and
the conditions set forth in clauses (c), (d)&nbsp;and (e)&nbsp;of the second paragraph of <U>Annex A</U>
hereto and clauses (i)(A) and (ii) (solely to the extent such clause relates to clause (i)(A)) of
<U>Annex A</U> hereto), to increase the consideration per Share payable in the Offer and to make
any other changes in the terms of the Offer; <I>provided, however, </I>that no change may be made without
the prior written consent of the Company which decreases the Exchange Ratio for the Offer from that
set forth herein, changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, reduces the maximum
number of Shares sought to be acquired in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to
the conditions set forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto, waives the Minimum Condition, modifies or
amends any of the conditions set forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto (although such conditions may be
waived as provided herein), makes other changes in the terms of the Offer that are in any manner
adverse to the holders of Shares or, except as provided below, extends the expiration date of the
Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may (A)&nbsp;extend the Offer beyond the initial scheduled
expiration date, which shall be twenty (20)&nbsp;business days following the date of commencement of the
Offer (the &#147;<B>Initial Expiration Date</B>&#148; or, as extended pursuant hereto, the &#147;<B>Expiration Date</B>&#148;), or
any subsequent scheduled expiration date, if, at the scheduled expiration of the Offer, any of the
conditions to Parent&#146;s obligation to accept for exchange, and to exchange the Offer Consideration
for, Shares tendered shall not be satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived,
subject, however<I>, </I>to the parties&#146; respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1 and (B)&nbsp;extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<B>SEC</B>&#148;) or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer.
Each extension of the Offer pursuant to clause (A)&nbsp;of the preceding sentence shall not exceed the
lesser of ten business days (or such longer period as the Company and Parent may agree in writing
in any particular instance) or such fewer number of days that Parent reasonably believes are
necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer set forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto to be satisfied;
<I>provided</I>, that no such extension or extensions shall occur after the earlier to occur of (1)&nbsp;the
date on which all of the conditions of the Offer have been satisfied or waived and (2)&nbsp;the Final
Date. In addition, if, at the Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer have been
satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement, waived by Parent) but the number of
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer constitutes less than ninety
percent (90%) of the Shares then outstanding, without the consent of the Company, Parent shall have
the right (subject to applicable law) to provide for a &#147;subsequent offering period&#148; (as
contemplated by Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act) for up to twenty (20)&nbsp;business days after
Parent&#146;s acceptance for exchange of the Shares then tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer, in which event Parent shall (1)&nbsp;give the required notice of such subsequent offering period
and (2)&nbsp;immediately accept for exchange, and promptly exchange the Offer Consideration for, all
Shares tendered and not withdrawn as of such Expiration Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or earlier
waiver of all the conditions of the Offer set forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto as of the Expiration
Date, Parent shall accept for exchange, and exchange the Offer Consideration (subject to subsection
(g)&nbsp;below) for, all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after
it is permitted to do so under applicable law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1 prior to
acceptance of Shares for exchange pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall, or shall cause Acquisition
to, promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares previously tendered.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the
Offer, no dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on
or with respect to any such fractional share interest and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu
thereof, each tendering stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would
have been received by such stockholder) shall, upon surrender of his or her Certificate or
Certificates (as defined below), be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest)
determined by multiplying (i)&nbsp;the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported on
the Nasdaq National Market (the &#147;<B>NASDAQ</B>&#148;) on the first date on which Parent accepts for payment all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer by (ii)&nbsp;the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of
the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for
consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the
corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as

information with respect to the Company and its directors, officers and affiliates as shall be
required to be included in the Offer Documents and S-4. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company,

counsel with any comments, whether written or oral, that Parent or its counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments and to provide the Company with copies of all such responses, whether
written or oral. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence to the SEC

prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Company or Parent, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should become known by Company or Parent, or Company,
Parent or their respective subsidiaries shall take any action, which should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to either the Offer Documents or the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9, as the case may be, so
that such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which obtains knowledge of such information shall promptly notify the
other party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, Company and Parent

disclosing such information promptly to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders
of Company

may withhold Offer Consideration as they reasonably deem necessary to satisfy their withholding
obligations under applicable law, and the withholding of any such Offer Consideration for such
purpose shall be treated as the payment thereof to the person from whom such amount was withheld
for purposes of determining whether such person received amounts to which such person is entitled
hereunder.

limitation, any subsequent offering that Parent may elect to extend pursuant to the terms and

the approval of the stockholders of the Company under NASDAQ rules and regulations or NASDAQ has
granted a waiver from any such rule or regulation that is reasonably acceptable to the parties
hereto, (ii)&nbsp;there is no other applicable law, rule or regulation that would require the approval
of the Company&#146;s stockholders for the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or any such approval shall have

Certificate of Incorporation or available in the treasury of the Company and (iv)&nbsp;any Parent Common

exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of any such
exercise and (ii)&nbsp;Parent shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company for the Offer
Consideration. Payment by Parent of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares may be made,
at Parent&#146;s option, by delivery of (A)&nbsp;immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Company, (B)&nbsp;a demand note issued by Parent in customary form that is reasonably

Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board as will give Parent, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of directors which
equals the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including for
purposes of this Section&nbsp;1.5 such Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but
excluding Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) bears to the number of Shares
outstanding. The Company shall, upon request by Parent, promptly increase the size of the Company
Board or exercise its best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Parent&#146;s designees to be elected to the Company Board in accordance with the
terms of this Section&nbsp;1.5 and shall cause Parent&#146;s designees to be so elected; <I>provided</I>, that
Parent&#146;s director designees shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the then-serving
directors of the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Effective Time (as defined in Section&nbsp;2.2
hereof), the Company Board shall have at least three (3)&nbsp;directors who are directors on the date
hereof and who are neither officers nor employees of the Company nor designees, stockholders,
affiliates or associates (within the meaning of the Federal securities laws) of Parent (such
directors, the &#147;<B>Independent Directors</B>&#148;). It is the intent of the parties hereto that such
Independent Directors will be the directors who serve as members of the Audit Committee of the
Company Board as of the date hereof, and such Independent Directors will continue to serve on the
Audit Committee of the Company Board and will be responsible for reviewing any Company filings
under the Exchange Act and any earnings releases of the Company during the interim period between
Parent&#146;s acceptance of any Shares pursuant to the Offer and the Effective Time. If at any time or
from time to time fewer than three (3)&nbsp;Independent Directors remain on the Company Board, the other
directors shall elect to the Company Board such number of persons who shall be neither officers nor
employees of the Company nor designees, shareholders, affiliates or associates of Parent and who
shall be reasonably acceptable to any remaining Independent Directors so that the total of such
persons and the remaining Independent Directors serving on the Company Board is at least three (3).
Any such person elected to the Company Board pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to
be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable law, the Company
shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section&nbsp;1.5 and shall
include in the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer
(or an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to such Rule&nbsp;14f-1 if Parent has not
theretofore designated directors) such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors as is required under such Section 14(f) and such Rule&nbsp;14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this such Section&nbsp;1.5. Parent shall supply the Company any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section
14(f) and such Rule&nbsp;14f-1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following
the time directors designated by Parent constitute a majority of the Company Board and prior to the
Effective Time, the affirmative vote of the Independent Directors shall be required to (i)&nbsp;amend or
terminate on behalf of the Company this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;exercise or waive any of the Company&#146;s
rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder, (iii)&nbsp;extend the time for performance of Parent&#146;s or
Acquisition&#146;s obligations hereunder or thereunder, (iv)&nbsp;take any other action required to be taken
by the Company Board hereunder or thereunder or (v)&nbsp;take any other action of the Company Board
under or in connection with this Agreement if such action would materially and adversely affect

the Independent Directors may retain one firm as legal counsel for such purpose in each such

writing by the parties hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.4. <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition

Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.5. <U>Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws</U>. The Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended as necessary to read the same as the
Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition in effect at the Effective Time until amended in
accordance with applicable law; <I>provided, </I>that at the Effective Time, Article&nbsp;I of the Restated

the initial directors of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (i)&nbsp;Shares held in the Company&#146;s treasury, (ii)&nbsp;Shares held by Parent or
Acquisition or (iii)&nbsp;the Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into
and shall become the right to receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.10(f) hereof) (collectively, the &#147;<B>Merger
Consideration</B>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares then, the
Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;The &#147;<B>Exchange Ratio</B>&#148; shall be .7928.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per
share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of the Surviving Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share held
by Parent, Acquisition or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the holder
thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
delivered with respect thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.9. <U>Dissenters and Appraisal Rights</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if appraisal rights are available under Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL in
respect of the Merger, then Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by stockholders who have demanded and perfected their demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL and, as of the
Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to such appraisal and
payment under the DGCL (the &#147;<B>Dissenting Shares</B>&#148;), shall not be converted as described in Section
2.8 hereof, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL; <I>provided </I>that, if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holder&#146;s Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, as
described in Section&nbsp;2.8 hereof, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a)&nbsp;prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders&#146; rights of appraisal and
(b)&nbsp;the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer
or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any payment made to the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be made in a manner that is consistent with the representations pertaining thereto, if
any, underlying the Parent 368 Opinion (as defined in <U>Annex A</U>) and the Company 368 Opinion
(as defined in <U>Annex A</U>). Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.8 hereof to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have
been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.10. <U>Exchange of Certificates</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;below, Parent shall
deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected
by Parent and Acquisition and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the &#147;<B>Exchange Agent</B>&#148;) for the
benefit of the holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article&nbsp;2: (i)&nbsp;certificates
representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.8 hereof and (ii)&nbsp;cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<B>Exchange Fund</B>&#148;), in
exchange for outstanding Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares (the &#147;<B>Certificates</B>&#148;) and whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.8 hereof: (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash
consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional share of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.10, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right of the
holder thereof to receive upon such surrender the certificate representing share of Parent Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled as contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.10.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of a fractional share shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.10(f) hereof, until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender
such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i)&nbsp;the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.10(f) hereof and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii)&nbsp;at the appropriate payment date the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;In the event that any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; <I>provided</I>, that Parent or the Exchange Agent
may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a suitable bond or indemnity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.10(c) or 2.10(f)
hereof ) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;2.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu
thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
shall upon surrender of his or her Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of
cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the NASDAQ on the date of the Effective Time by the fractional share interest
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained for consideration,
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and
accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of the
Company upon the one year anniversary the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article&nbsp;2 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares, as the case may be, and any applicable dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to and as required by any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent or the Exchange Agent may withhold
Merger Consideration as they reasonably deem necessary to satisfy their withholding obligations
under applicable law, and the withholding of any such Merger Consideration for such purpose shall
be treated as the payment thereof to the person from whom such amount was withheld for purposes of
determining whether such person received amounts to which such person is entitled hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">Section&nbsp;2.11. <U>Stock Options</U><I>.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (each, a &#147;<B>Company Stock

Incentive Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, 2000 Equity Participation Plan or any other agreement or
arrangement, whether vested or unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into options
to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.11. All plans or
agreements described above pursuant to which any Company Stock Option has been issued or may be
issued are referred to collectively as the &#147;<B>Company Plans</B>.&#148; At the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(but taking into account any changes thereto, including any acceleration in the vesting or
exercisability of such option by reason of this Agreement or the Merger or the transactions or
matters contemplated by this Agreement provided for in such option or the applicable plan with
respect thereto) as were applicable to such Company Stock Option, a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole share, at a price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to (i)&nbsp;the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Company Stock Option divided by (ii)&nbsp;the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; <I>provided</I>,
that in the case of any option to which Section&nbsp;421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section&nbsp;422 of the Code (&#147;<B>incentive stock options</B>&#148; or &#147;<B>ISOs</B>&#148;), Parent may cause
the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option to be determined so as to comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of
Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders&#146; rights pursuant to the
Company Plan and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such options shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section&nbsp;2.11 after
giving effect to the Merger).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options assumed
in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.11. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to any Company Stock Options and
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;At or before the Effective Time, the Company and/or the Company Board shall take all
action necessary to give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section&nbsp;2.11.

Sixty-One Thousand Seven Hundred Forty-Five (19,661,745) Shares were issued and outstanding, and
Ten Million (10,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which, as of

the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to such termination and all matters arising out of or in

Acquisition nor their stockholders shall be entitled to any further or other rights, claims or
remedies. It is specifically agreed that the amount to be paid pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.3(a)
represents liquidated damages and not a penalty. The Company hereby waives any right to set-off or
counterclaim against such amount.

hereto may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party, (b)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (c)&nbsp;waive
compliance by another party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument, in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party

to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and
