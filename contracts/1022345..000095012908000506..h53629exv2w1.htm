agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be
exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;3.7</U>. For the
avoidance of doubt, an unresolved dispute with respect to one or more Environmental Defects and
Remediation Amounts shall not delay Closing and the Parties shall close on the applicable Assets
with no adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;3.7(e)</U>. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney
with at least ten (10)&nbsp;years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15)&nbsp;Days after the Closing Date, and absent such
agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the &#147;Environmental
Arbitrator&#148;). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article. The Environmental Arbitrator&#146;s
determination shall be made within twenty (20)&nbsp;Days after submission of the matters in dispute and
shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination,
the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.7</U> and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental
Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator,
however, may not award the Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed
by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as
an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and
other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Subject to the following sentence, to the extent that
the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into
account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.3</U> or <U>Section
2.4</U>, then within ten (10)&nbsp;Days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount, and subject to this <U>Section
3.7</U>, (i)&nbsp;Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental
Arbitrator to Seller and (ii)&nbsp;Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Following the determination by the Environmental Arbitrator of
the Remediation Amount with respect to an Asset, Seller may elect to retain the Asset in which case
(A)&nbsp;there shall be no award to either Party with respect to the Remediation Amount, (B)&nbsp;Seller
shall refund to Buyer the Allocated Value attributable to such Asset and (C)&nbsp;Buyer shall convey
the Asset to Seller free and clear of all encumbrances or other defects in title created by,
through or under Buyer.

4.6</U>, (without prejudice to its right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this

the condition to Closing set forth in Section&nbsp;9.1(c) not being satisfied, and the conditions to
closing set forth in Sections&nbsp;9.1(a), 9.1(b) and 9.3 are satisfied, then Seller shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price as liquidated damages.
The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this Section has been included because, in the
event of such a termination of this Agreement, the actual damages to be incurred by Buyer can
reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and
because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately.

Parties or parties thereto. Arbitration may be initiated by a Party (&#147;Claimant&#148;) serving written
notice on the other Party (&#147;Respondent&#148;) that the Claimant has referred the Arbitrable Dispute to
binding arbitration. Claimant&#146;s notice initiating binding arbitration must describe in reasonable
detail the nature of the Arbitrable Dispute and the facts and circumstances relating thereto and
identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. Respondent shall respond to Claimant within thirty

the second arbitrator has been appointed, then a third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA
office in Houston, Texas, with due regard given to the selection criteria above and input from the
Parties and other arbitrators. The AAA shall select the third arbitrator not later than ninety
(90)&nbsp;Days from initiation of arbitration. In the event AAA should fail to select the third
arbitrator within ninety (90)&nbsp;Days from initiation of arbitration, then either Party may petition
the Chief United States District Judge for the Southern District of Texas to select the third
arbitrator. Due regard shall be given to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties
and other arbitrators. Claimant shall pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by
or for it, and Respondent shall pay the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator named by or for
it. Claimant and Respondent shall each pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the third
arbitrator. All arbitrators must be neutral parties who have never been officers, directors or
employees of the Parties or any of their Affiliates. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, the two (2)&nbsp;arbitrators named by the Parties must have not less than seven (7)&nbsp;years
experience in the energy industry, and must have a formal education or training in the area of
dispute resolution. The hearing shall be conducted in Houston, Texas and commence within sixty

proceed diligently and in good faith in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible.
The arbitrators shall determine the Arbitrable Disputes of the Parties and render a final award in

such Law. The arbitrators shall render their decision on or before sixty (60)&nbsp;Days following the
