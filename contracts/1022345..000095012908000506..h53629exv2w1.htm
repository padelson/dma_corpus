The Party responsible for the payment of amounts received shall reimburse the other Party within twenty (20) Days after the end of the month in which such amounts were received by the Party responsible for payment and such amounts shall not be taken into account for purposes of the Final Settlement Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 2.5_ shall not apply to amounts received prior to Closing if such amounts are included, in whole or in part, in the Preliminary Settlement Statement.

as provided otherwise in this Agreement, Buyer shall pay or will reimburse
Seller for any and all costs and expenses paid after Closing by Seller (to
the extent not accounted for in the Preliminary Settlement Statement) that
are attributable to the Assets or the business or the operations of
the Company on and after the Effective Time. The Party responsible for the
payment of such costs and expenses shall reimburse the other Party within
twenty (20) Days after the end of the month in which the applicable invoice
and proof of payment of such invoice were received by the Party responsible
for payment and such amounts shall not be taken into account for purposes of
the Final Settlement Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this  _Section
2.6_ shall not apply to amounts paid prior to Closing if such amounts are
included, in whole or in part, in the Preliminary Settlement Statement. Such
amounts (to the extent the same differ from the estimates in the Preliminary
Settlement Statement) will be accounted for in the Final Settlement
Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section covers only invoiced
costs and expenses and not Claims or Liabilities. 

  

 2.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller and Buyer agree to (a) allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with the allocation schedule attached as _Schedule 2.7_ hereto (the "Allocated Values"), (b) treat and report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in all respects consistent with _Schedule 2.7_ for purposes of any Taxes, and (c) not take any action inconsistent with such obligations.

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_, Seller shall be entitled to retain the Deposit (together with all accrued interest) as liquidated damages. Sellers retention of the Deposit shall be the sole remedy of Seller for any breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement in the event of a termination pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_. The provision for payment of liquidated damages in this Section has been included because, in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_, the actual damages to be incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure accurately.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.1(a)_ to the contrary, no Invasive Activity shall be conducted by Buyer or any Buyer Representative upon the Assets. 

   

 (c) Buyer shall abide by Sellers, the Companys and any third party operators safety rules, regulations, and operating policies while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of the Assets. Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold each of the operators of the Assets and Seller Group harmless from and against any and all Claims arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental assessment, or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyer Representative with respect to the Assets; even if such Claims arise out of or result from the sole, joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault of a member of Seller Group, excepting only Claims actually resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a member of Seller Group. 

   

 3.2 _The Company s Title_. Except for the special warranty of title set forth in _Section 6.9(c)_ and without limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article 3_ , Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Companys title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (a) before Closing, shall be as set forth in _Section 3.3_ and (b) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in _Section 6.9(c)_. 

    ##### 

  

  

 3.3 _Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) _Title Defect Notices_. On or before January 15, 2008 (the "Title Claim Date"), Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section 3.3(a)_ (collectively the "Title Defect Notices" and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Article 3_. For all purposes of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Title Claim Date; provided, however, that, for purposes of Sellers special warranty to title under _Section 6.9(c)_, such waiver shall not apply to any matter that at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Title Claim Date is not properly reflected of record at the MMS. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Leases (and the applicable zone(s) therein) and/or other Assets affected by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, as soon as practicable prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all Title Defects discovered by Buyer, which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date. Buyer shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyers or any of its Affiliates employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyers due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Title Claim Date. 

   

 (b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of the Title Benefit, (ii)) the Leases (and the applicable zone(s) therein) affected by the Title Benefit, and (iii) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Leases (and the applicable zone(s) therein) is increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations upon which Sellers belief is based. Except for purposes of defending against or paying any claim that Seller has breached its special warranty of title under Section 6.9(c), Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Title Claim Date. 

   

 (c) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to Closing (the "Cure Period"), any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. 

   

 (d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount asserted with respect thereto and subject to the rights of the parties pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_, in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to: 

    ##### 

  

  

 (i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by an amount ("Title Defect Amount") determined pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ or _3.3(j)_ as being the value of such Title Defect; 

  

 (ii) indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement (the "Title Indemnity Agreement") in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ ; 

  

 (iii) convey the Title Defect Property with a reduction in the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount and cure the Title Defect within 90 Days after Closing in which case Buyer shall pay to Seller the Title Defect Amount; 

  

 (iv) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, by conveying them to Seller or its designee, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets; or 

  

 (v) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_. 

  

 (e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Lease (or specified zone(s) therein) affected by Title Benefits reported under _Section 3.3(b)_, the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Lease caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. 

   

 (f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Sellers special warranty of title under _Section 6.9(c)_ , _Section 3.3(d)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to the Companys failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Asset. 

   

 (g) _Title Defect Amount_. The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount by which the Allocated Value of the affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following terms and conditions: 

   

 (i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Defect Amount; 

  

 (ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property; 

  

 (iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A_, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A_; 

  

 (iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above, the Title Defect 

   ##### 

  

 

Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by
the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller and such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; 

   

 (v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Amount hereunder; and 

  

 (vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 3_, the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property. 

  

 (h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions: 

   

 (i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount shall be the Title Benefit Amount; and 

  

 (ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue Interest for any Lease (or the specified zone(s) therein) and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated in _Exhibit A_ , then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of the affected Lease (or the specified zone(s) therein) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated in  _Exhibit A_. 

  

 (i) _Title Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed one hundred thousand Dollars ($100,000) ("Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual Title Defect Threshold unless the Aggregate Deductible has been reached and then only to the extent the Aggregate Deductible is exceeded. 

   

 (j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant to this _Section 3.3(j)_. For the avoidance of doubt, an unresolved dispute with respect to one or more Title Defects shall not delay Closing and the Parties shall close on such Title Defect Properties with no adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to this _Section 3.3(j)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the end of the Cure Period, and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American 

    ##### 

  

 

Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) Days
after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding
upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the
Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in _Sections 3.3(g)_
and _3.3(h)_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a
proper determination. The Title Arbitrator, however, may not award the Buyer
a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer
in its applicable Title Defect Notice and may not award Seller a greater
Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount claimed by Seller in its
applicable Title Benefit Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert
for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Title Defect,
Title Benefit, Title Defect Amounts and/or Title Benefit Amounts submitted by
either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party
with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal
fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the
extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_
, then within ten (10) Days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice
to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a
Title Benefit Amount, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer
the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. 

   

 3.4 _Casualty or Condemnation Loss_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion or other mechanical failure (including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well) and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets. 

   

 (b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by Casualty Loss or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of such individual casualty or taking exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by such casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to such casualty or taking, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date) but in no event later than ninety (90) Days after the Closing Date, (ii) to indemnify Buyer through a document reasonably acceptable to Seller and Buyer against any costs or expenses that Buyer reasonably incurs to repair the Assets subject to such casualty or taking or (iii) to retain the Asset and deduct the Allocated Value from the Purchase Price. In each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against Third Parties with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the parties otherwise agree in writing. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the Assets is destroyed by Casualty Loss or is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss to the Assets as a result of such individual casualty or taking is 10 percent (10%) or less of the Purchase Price based on the Allocated Value of the affected Assets, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at Closing, shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of such casualty or taking with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer, or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in, insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or against the Seller Group) arising out of such casualty or taking with respect to the Assets; provided, however, that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, title, interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties or in defending or asserting rights in such condemnation or eminent domain action with respect to the Assets. 

   

 (d) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof after the date of this Agreement, but no taking of such Asset or portion thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in such condemnation or eminent domain action, including any future awards therein, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets threatened to be taken, except that Seller shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, titles, interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in defending or asserting rights in such action with respect to the Assets. 

   

 3.5 _Insurance_. Buyer understands and agrees that from and after the Closing, (a) no insurance coverage shall be provided to the Company or Buyer under (i) any insurance policy issued to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, or (ii) any insurance policy (including reinsurance) issued by any insurance company Affiliate of Seller ((i) and (ii) being together, "Sellers Insurance Policies"), and (b) no Claims regarding any matter whatsoever, whether or not arising from events occurring prior to Closing, shall be made by the Company or Buyer against or under Sellers Insurance Policies, regardless of their date of issuance. 

  

 3.6 _Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign_. 

  

 (a) With respect to any preferential purchase right which will be triggered by the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller, prior to the Closing, shall send to the holder of each such right a notice, in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such right. In addition, prior to the Closing, Seller shall send to each holder of a right to consent to assignment pertaining to the Assets triggered by the transactions contemplated hereby a notice seeking such partys consent to the transaction contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) If, prior to the Closing, any holder of a preferential purchase right notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to which its preferential purchase right applies, the exercise of such preferential purchase right shall constitute a Title Defect, that Asset shall be excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer to the extent of the interest 

    ##### 

  

 

affected by the preferential purchase right, by conveying such Asset to Seller
or its designee, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the relevant Asset allocable to such interest. Seller shall be
entitled to all proceeds paid by a party exercising a preferential purchase
right prior to the Closing. If such holder of such preferential
purchase right thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Asset
covered by such right on or before thirty (30) Days following the Closing
Date, then Seller shall so notify Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase on or
before ten (10) Days following receipt of such notice, subject to
Buyers satisfaction that such preferential right has been waived, such Asset
from Seller, under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the
portion of the Purchase Price previously allocated to it. 

   

 (c) If a preferential purchase right burdening any Asset is not exercised, or the time for exercising such preferential purchase right has not expired, prior to the Closing Date, then Buyer shall purchase such Asset subject to the preferential purchase right, and if such preferential purchase right is subsequently exercised, Buyer shall deliver the affected Asset to the holder of such preferential purchase right pursuant to an assignment in substantially the same form as the Assignment and shall keep the proceeds paid for such Asset by the party exercising the preferential purchase right. 

   

 (d) All Assets for which preferential purchase rights have been waived, or as to which the period to exercise such right has expired prior to the Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 

   

 (e) If Seller fails to obtain a consent prior to the Closing and the failure to obtain such consent would cause the indirect assignment of such Asset to Buyer to be void, then the portion of the Asset subject to such failed consent shall constitute a Title Defect, and Seller and Buyer shall have the rights and remedies set forth in _Section 3.3_ with respect thereto. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 3.6_ shall not alter Sellers representations and warranties in _Section 6.13_. 

   

 3.7 _Environmental Defects_. 

  

 (a) _Assertions of Environmental Defects_. Buyer must deliver claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section 3.7(a)_ (collectively the "Environmental Defect Notices" and individually an "Environmental Defect Notice") not later than the Title Claim Date setting forth any matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this _Section 3.7_. For all purposes of this Agreement but subject to Buyers remedy for a breach of Sellers representation contained in _Section 6.19_, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Title Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged Environmental Defect, (ii) a description of each Asset (or portion thereof) that is affected by the alleged Environmental Defect, (iii) Buyers assertion of the Allocated Value of the portion of the Assets affected by the alleged Environmental Defect, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of the alleged Environmental Defect, and (v) a calculation of the Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is 

    ##### 

  

 

attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyers calculation of the
Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe
in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the Environmental Condition
that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify all
assumptions used by the Buyer in calculating the Remediation
Amount, including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
cure any claimed Environmental Defect on or before Closing. 

   

 (b) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to dispute the existence of a Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 3.7(a)_ is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to: 

   

 (i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount; 

  

 (ii) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect; 

  

 (iii) retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, by conveying them to Seller or its designee, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset and such associated Assets; or 

  

 (iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(e)_. 

 

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for Remediation of such Environmental
Defect and all Liabilities with respect thereto. If Seller elects the option
set forth in clause (ii) above, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of
Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and shall have access to the
affected Assets after the Closing Date to implement and complete
such Remediation in accordance with an Access Agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as  _Exhibit G_ (the "Access Agreement"). Seller will
be deemed to have adequately completed the Remediation required in the
immediately preceding sentence (A) upon receipt of a certificate or approval
from the applicable Governmental Authority that the Remediation has been
implemented to the extent necessary to comply with existing regulatory
requirements or (B) upon receipt of a certificate from a licensed
professional engineer that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent
necessary to comply with existing regulatory requirements. 

   

 (c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to _Section 11.1(e)_ and Buyers remedy for a breach of Sellers representation contained in _Section 6.19_, _Section 3.7(b)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect. 

   

 (d) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by 

    ##### 

  

 

Seller for any individual Environmental Defect for which the Remediation
Amount does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) ("Individual
Environmental Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the
Individual Environmental Threshold unless the Aggregate Deductible has been
reached and then only to the extent the Aggregate Deductible is exceeded. 

   

 (e) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section 3.7_. For the avoidance of doubt, an unresolved dispute with respect to one or more Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts shall not delay Closing and the Parties shall close on the applicable Assets with no adjustment to the Purchase Price, subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to this  _Section 3.7(e)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) Days after the Closing Date, and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Article. The Environmental Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 3.7_ and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award the Buyer a greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. Subject to the following sentence, to the extent that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_ , then within ten (10) Days after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Remediation Amount, and subject to this _Section 3.7_ , (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Following the determination by the Environmental Arbitrator of the Remediation Amount with respect to an Asset, Seller may elect to retain the Asset in which case (A) there shall be no award to either Party with respect to the Remediation Amount, (B) Seller shall refund to Buyer the Allocated Value attributable to such Asset and (C) Buyer shall convey the Asset to Seller free and clear of all encumbrances or other defects in title created by, through or under Buyer. 

    ##### 

  

     

 3.8 _NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development, and production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances from the Assets.

    ##### 

  

  

 (i) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller with an Indemnity Claim Notice within twelve (12) months after Closing with respect to such Claim; 

  

 (ii) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder unless the Aggregate Deductible has been reached and then only to the extent the Aggregate Deductible is exceeded; and 

  

 (iii) any Claims that, together with all other Claims for indemnity pursuant to Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(f), in the aggregate exceed 30% of the Adjusted Purchase Price. 

  

 (b) Seller shall have no obligation or liability for breaches of _Section 6.9(e)_ for: 

   

 (i) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller with an Indemnity Claim Notice within two (2) years after Closing with respect to such Claim; and 

  

 (ii) any Claims that, together with all other Claims for indemnity pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , in the aggregate exceed 100% of the Adjusted Purchase Price. 

  

 (c) Seller shall have no obligation or liability for breaches of the Designated Covenants,  _Sections 6.15_, _6.17_ , or _6.18_ for: 

   

 (i) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller with any Indemnity Claim Notice by 60 Days following the expiration of the period of the applicable statute of limitations; and 

  

 (ii) any Claims that, together with all other Claims for indemnity pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , in the aggregate exceed 100% of the Adjusted Purchase Price. 

  

 (d) Seller shall have no obligation or liability under _Section 4.2(e)_ or for breaches of Section 6.10 for any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller with any Indemnity Claim Notice by 60 Days following the expiration of the period of the applicable statute of limitations. 

   

 (e) Seller shall have no obligation or liability under _Section 4.2(f)_ for: 

   

 (i) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder, if Buyer has not provided Seller with any Indemnity Claim Notice by 60 Days following the expiration of the period of the applicable statute of limitations; 

  

 (ii) any Claim asserted against Seller hereunder unless the Aggregate Deductible has been reached and then only to the extent the Aggregate Deductible is exceeded; and 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) any Claims that, together with all other Claims for indemnity pursuant to _Sections 4.2(a)_ and _4.2(f)_ , in the aggregate exceed 30% of the Adjusted Purchase Price. 

  

 4.5 _Notice of Claims_. If a Claim is asserted against a Person for which a Party may have an obligation of indemnity under this _Article 4_ or elsewhere under this Agreement (an "Indemnity Claim"), the indemnified Person shall give the indemnifying Party written notice of the underlying Claim setting forth the particulars associated with the underlying Claim (including a copy of the written underlying Claim, if any) as then known by the indemnified Person ("Indemnity Claim Notice"). For Indemnity Claims with respect to which the threshold limitation in _Section 4.4_ applies, an Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to have been made upon the indemnified Persons providing an initial Indemnity Claim Notice to the indemnifying Party stating that the Claim underlying the Indemnity Claim could reasonably be expected to exceed the Threshold Amount. The indemnified Person shall, to the extent practicable, give an Indemnity Claim Notice within such time as will allow the indemnifying Party a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the underlying Claim; provided, however, that (a) failure to do so shall not affect an indemnified Persons rights hereunder except for, and only to the extent of, any incremental increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to give notice; and (b) the foregoing shall not extend the time period set forth in _Section 4.4(a)_ (if applicable to the Claim), but if an Indemnity Claim Notice is given to an indemnifying Party within the applicable time period (if any) with respect to such Claim set forth in _Section 4.4(a)_, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be effective, subject to the other limitations in _Section 4.4_ (if applicable), as to costs and expenses incurred or suffered after the expiration of any such time period, with respect to the matter described in such Indemnity Claim Notice. 

  

 4.6 _Defense of Non-Party Claims_. Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice involving a Non-Party for which an indemnifying Party believes it may have an obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the indemnifying Party shall, if it so elects in accordance with this _Section 4.6_ , (without prejudice to its right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume the defense of the Non-Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnifying Party, and the indemnified Person shall cooperate in all reasonable respects. If any Non-Party Claim involves a fact pattern wherein each Party may have an obligation to indemnify the other Party, each Party may assume the defense of and hire counsel for that portion of the Non-Party Claim for which it may have an obligation of indemnity. In all instances, the indemnified Person may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Non-Party Claim; provided, however, if the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Non-Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section 4.6_ and has agreed to indemnify the indemnified Person, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified Person shall be borne solely by the indemnified Person. To the extent that the underlying Non-Party Claim meets any applicable per-Claim threshold, if (a) the underlying Non-Party Claim plus all previously asserted underlying Claims have exceeded the Indemnity Deductible Amount, if applicable in the circumstances, and (b) the indemnifying Party elects by written notice to undertake the defense of the Non-Party Claim within thirty (30) Days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then (i) the indemnifying Party shall defend the indemnified Person against such Non-Party Claim, (ii) the indemnifying Party shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim, (iii) the indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Non-Party Claim that (A) does not include a 

   ##### 

  

    

provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
indemnified Person from all liability with respect to such Non-Party Claim,
and (B) would restrict such indemnified Persons ability to conduct its
business in the ordinary course, and (iv) the indemnified Person shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to such Non-Party Claim without the indemnifying Partys prior
written consent. If the indemnifying Party has not elected to undertake the
defense of a Non-Party Claim, or if the indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Non-Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 4.6_ but fails to
diligently defend against the Non-Party Claim within thirty (30) Days
following any written notice from such indemnified Person asserting such
failure, then the indemnified Person shall have the right to defend, at the
sole cost and expense of the indemnifying Party (to the extent the
indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the Non-Party
Claim by all appropriate proceedings. In such instances, the indemnified
Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided that
the indemnified Person shall not settle such Non-Party Claim without
the written consent of the indemnifying Party; provided further, however,
that if the indemnifying Party fails to notify the indemnified Person in
writing as to whether or not it consents to such settlement within thirty
(30) Days following its receipt of notice of such settlement from
the indemnified Person, then such consent shall be deemed given. The
indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement controlled by an indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section
4.6_, and the indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this 
_Section 4.6_, if the indemnifying Party disputes its potential liability to
the indemnified Person under this _Section 4.6_ and if such dispute is
resolved in favor of the indemnifying Party, the indemnifying Party shall not
be required to bear the costs and expenses of the indemnified Persons
defense pursuant to this _Section 4.6_. 

  

 4.7 _Insurance, Taxes_. The amount of any Claims for which any party is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding (a) tax benefit created or generated or (b) insurance proceeds realized by such party if a claim were properly pursued under the relevant insurance arrangements. 

  

 4.8 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each of the Parties expressly waives and agrees not to, and to cause the members of the Buyer Group in the case of Buyer and the members of the Seller Group in the case of Seller not to, seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for lost profits of any kind with respect to any dispute arising under, related to, or in connection with this Agreement or breach hereof (except such damages that are payable to a third party with respect to a third party claim for which any Person is seeking indemnification hereunder). The Parties agree that no indemnified Person shall be entitled to any such damages under this Agreement. 

  

 4.9 _Survival of Claims_. Notwithstanding the termination of any Claim period set forth in  _Section 4.4(a)_, any Claim properly raised within the applicable time period for such Claim shall survive until such Claim and the indemnity with respect thereto are resolved. 

  

 4.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. If Closing occurs, the express indemnities set forth in this  _Article 4_ and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies for the Parties for the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any Claim arising out of, resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated hereby, 

   ##### 

  

    

and each Party hereby releases, waives and discharges, and covenants not to
sue (and shall cause the members of the Buyer Group or Seller Group, as
applicable, to release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue) with
respect to, any cause of action not expressly provided for in this Agreement
including Claims under state or federal securities Laws and Claims available
at common Law, in equity or by statute (except in the case of fraud). 

  

 4.11 _Extent of Indemnification_. Without limiting or enlarging the scope of the indemnification, disclaimer and assumption obligations set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, an indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder in accordance with the terms hereof, regardless of whether the indemnifiable loss giving rise to any such indemnification obligation is the result of the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other legal fault or violation of any Law of or by any such indemnified Person. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that this statement complies with the express negligence rule and is conspicuous. 

  

 4.12 _Disclaimer of Application of Anti-Indemnity Statutes._ The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of any anti-indemnity statute relating to oilfield services and associated activities shall not be applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 4.13 _Waiver of Right to Rescission._ Seller and Buyer acknowledge that the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE 11 
 TERMINATION

 (a) by the mutual written agreement of the Parties; 

  

 (b) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein would violate any final Order of any 

   ##### 

  

 

Governmental Authority having appropriate jurisdiction enjoining the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein; provided that the Party
seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.1(b)_ shall
have used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of and to
remove such Order; 

   

 (c) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the other Party has breached this Agreement and such breach causes any of the conditions to Closing for the other Party not to be satisfied (or, if prior to Closing, is of such a magnitude that it will not be possible for such condition to be satisfied); provided, however, that in the case of a breach that is capable of being cured (other than a breach of Buyers obligation to pay the Closing Amount which for purposes of clarification shall have no cure period), the breaching Party shall have a period of thirty (30) Days following receipt of such notice to attempt to cure the breach and the termination under this _Section 11.1(c)_ shall not become effective until the end of such thirty (30) Day period; provided, further, that if at the end of such thirty (30) Day period, the breaching Party is endeavoring in good faith, and proceeding diligently, to cure such breach, the breaching Party shall have an additional thirty (30) Days in which to effect such cure and the termination shall only become effective, in such case, upon the expiration of this sixty (60) Day period; provided, further, that such cure periods shall not extend the Outside Date and shall be reduced so that they end on the Outside Date; 

  

 (d) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if Closing has not occurred by March 31, 2008 (the "Outside Date"), through no breach of this Agreement by the terminating Party or its Affiliates; and 

  

 (e) by either Party (by giving written notice to the other Party), if the sum of (i) all Title Defect Amounts determined under _Section 3.3(d)(i)_ prior to Closing, less the sum of all Title Benefit Amounts determined under _Section 3.3(b)_ prior to Closing, plus (ii) all Remediation Amounts for Environmental Defects determined under _Section 3.7(b)(i)_ prior to the Closing, equals thirty percent (30%) or more of the Purchase Price. 

  

 11.2 _Effect of Termination_. A Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under _Section 11.1_ if it is then in breach of this Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 11.1_, such termination shall be without liability to either Party, except with respect to any Party who has willfully breached this Agreement and except that performance of the obligations contained in this _Section 11.2_ and in _Sections 2.8_ , _4.8_ , _11.3_ , _12.1_ , _13.1_ , _13.4_ , _13.8_ ,  _13.10_ , _13.11_ , _13.12_ , _13.13_ , _13.14_ , _13.15_ ,  _13.16_ , _13.17_ , _13.18_ and _13.19_ shall survive termination of this Agreement.

If Closing of the transaction contemplated under the terms of this Agreement occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (which termination shall be effective as of Closing). The Confidentiality Agreement (Seller) shall terminate in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) Buyer agrees to maintain all information made available to it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement regarding Seller or Sellers Affiliates (other than the Company) or the Excluded Assets confidential and to, and cause the rest of the Buyer Group to, maintain in strict confidence any and all such information. It is understood that Buyer shall have no obligation or liability hereunder with respect to information that (i) is in or, through no fault of Buyer Group, comes into the public domain, (ii) any member of the Buyer Group is required by any Governmental Authority to disclose or (iii) Buyer in good faith deems to be required to be disclosed by any member of the Buyer Group under applicable Law or under applicable rules and regulations of a stock exchange or market on which the securities of such Person are listed, in connection with Tax Returns, financial statement preparation and audit or as requested by ratings agencies, or in connection with pursuing and defending Claims pursuant to _Article 4_. In each case to which the exceptions in clause (ii) or (iii) apply, Buyer will, and will direct the other members of the Buyer Group (as applicable) to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to give Seller reasonable advance notice and take such commercially reasonable actions as Seller may propose to minimize the required disclosure. 

  

 (c) From and after the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause the rest of the Seller Group to maintain in strict confidence any and all confidential information concerning the Assets or the Company or any non-public information concerning Buyer or its business obtained during the course of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. It is understood that Seller shall have no obligation or liability hereunder with respect to information that (i) is in or, through no fault of Seller Group, comes into the public domain, (ii) any member of the Seller Group is required by any Governmental Authority to disclose or (iii) Seller in good faith deems to be required to be disclosed by any member of the Seller Group under applicable Law or under applicable rules and regulations of a stock exchange or market on which the securities of such Person are listed, in connection with Tax Returns, financial statement preparation and audit or as requested by ratings agencies, or in connection with pursuing and defending Claims pursuant to _Article 4_. In each case to which the exceptions in clause (ii) or (iii) apply, Seller will, and will direct the other members of the Seller Group (as applicable) to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to give Buyer reasonable advance notice and take such commercially reasonable actions as Buyer may propose to minimize the required disclosure. 

  

ARTICLE 12 
 ARBITRATION 

   

 12.1 _Arbitration_. Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, any and all Arbitrable Disputes must be resolved through the use of binding arbitration using three (3) 

   ##### 

  

 

arbitrators, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA,
as supplemented to the extent necessary to determine any procedural appeal
questions by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code).
If there is any inconsistency between this Article and the Commercial
Arbitration Rules or the Federal Arbitration Act, the terms of this Article
shall control the rights and obligations of the Parties. If there is more
than one (1) Arbitrable Dispute that involves the same facts and parties as
the facts and parties with respect to which an arbitration has been initiated
pursuant to this Agreement, such disputes shall be consolidated into the
first arbitration initiated pursuant to this Agreement. No other arbitration
shall be consolidated with any arbitration initiated pursuant to this
Agreement without the agreement of the Parties or parties thereto.
Arbitration may be initiated by a Party ("Claimant") serving written notice
on the other Party ("Respondent") that the Claimant has referred the
Arbitrable Dispute to binding arbitration. Claimants notice initiating
binding arbitration must describe in reasonable detail the nature of the
Arbitrable Dispute and the facts and circumstances relating thereto
and identify the arbitrator Claimant has appointed. Respondent shall respond
to Claimant within thirty (30) Days after receipt of Claimants notice,
identifying the arbitrator Respondent has appointed. If Respondent fails for
any reason to name an arbitrator within the thirty (30) Day period, Claimant
shall name the arbitrator for Respondents account. The two (2) arbitrators so
chosen shall select a third arbitrator (who must have not less than seven (7)
years experience as a lawyer in the energy industry) within thirty (30) Days
after the second arbitrator has been appointed. If the two arbitrators are
unable to agree on a third arbitrator within thirty (30) Days from the
date the second arbitrator has been appointed, then a third arbitrator shall
be selected by the AAA office in Houston, Texas, with due regard given to the
selection criteria above and input from the Parties and other arbitrators.
The AAA shall select the third arbitrator not later than ninety (90) Days
from initiation of arbitration. In the event AAA should fail to select the
third arbitrator within ninety (90) Days from initiation of arbitration, then
either Party may petition the Chief United States District Judge for the
Southern District of Texas to select the third arbitrator. Due regard shall
be given to the selection criteria above and input from the Parties and other
arbitrators. Claimant shall pay the compensation and expenses of the
arbitrator named by or for it, and Respondent shall pay the compensation and
expenses of the arbitrator named by or for it. Claimant and Respondent shall
each pay one-half of the compensation and expenses of the third arbitrator.
All arbitrators must be neutral parties who have never been officers,
directors or employees of the Parties or any of their Affiliates. Unless
expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, the two (2) arbitrators named
by the Parties must have not less than seven (7) years experience in the
energy industry, and must have a formal education or training in the area
of dispute resolution. The hearing shall be conducted in Houston, Texas and
commence within sixty (60) Days after the selection of the third arbitrator.
The Parties and the arbitrators should proceed diligently and in good faith
in order that the award may be made as promptly as possible. The arbitrators
shall determine the Arbitrable Disputes of the Parties and render a final
award in accordance with the substantive Law of the State of Texas, excluding
the conflicts provisions of such Law. The arbitrators shall render their
decision on or before sixty (60) Days following the completion of the
hearing. The arbitrators decision shall be in writing and set forth the
reasons for the award and shall include an award of costs to the prevailing
party, including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements. All statutes of limitations and defenses based upon passage of
time applicable to any Arbitrable Dispute (including any counterclaim
or setoff) shall be interrupted by the filing of the arbitration and
suspended while the arbitration is pending. The terms hereof shall not create
or limit any 

   ##### 

  

   

obligations of a Party to defend, indemnify, or hold harmless another Party
against court proceedings or other Claims. In order to prevent irreparable
harm, the arbitrators shall have the power to grant temporary or permanent
injunctive or other equitable relief. A Party may, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, seek temporary injunctive relief from any court
of competent jurisdiction; provided that the Party seeking such relief shall
(if arbitration has not already been commenced) simultaneously commence
arbitration. Such court-ordered relief shall not continue more than ten (10)
Days after the appointment of the arbitrators and in no event for longer than
sixty (60) Days. Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the
decision of the arbitrators shall be binding on and non-appealable by the
Parties. Each Party agrees that any arbitration award against it may be
enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction and that any Party may
authorize any such court to enter judgment on the arbitrators decisions.
The arbitrators may not grant or award indirect, consequential, punitive or
exemplary damages or damages for lost profits.

As soon as practicable after recording or filing, Buyer shall furnish Seller with all recording data and evidence of all required filings. Buyer

 13.4 _Expenses._ Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring the same, including, without limitation, legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses.

 13.8 _Amendments, Waivers, Rights Cumulative and Severability_. No amendments or other modifications to this Agreement shall be effective or binding on either of the Parties unless the same are in writing, designated as an amendment or modification, and signed by both Seller and Buyer. Any of the terms, covenants, representations, warranties, or conditions hereof may be waived only by a written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party hereto waiving compliance. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer, or their respective officers, employees, agents, or representatives, nor any failure by Seller or Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any other term, covenant, representation, or warranty. The rights of Seller and Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of any such right

shall not preclude the exercise of any other right. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any adverse manner to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

   

 13.9 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement may not be assigned, either in whole or in part, without the express written consent of the non-assigning Party.

 13.13 _Public Announcements_. Neither Seller nor Buyer (including any of its agents, employees or Affiliates in either case) may issue a public statement or press release with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the price and other terms) without good faith prior consultation with the other Party. If the Parties are unable in good faith to agree on the content of a public statement or press release, the releasing Party shall be entitled to release its version of the statement. 

  

 13.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

The Parties acknowledge that they have had an adequate opportunity to review each and every provision contained in this Agreement and to submit the same to legal counsel for review and comment.

 13.16 _Schedules_. The inclusion of any matter upon any Schedule attached hereto does not constitute an admission or agreement that such matter is material with respect to the representations and warranties contained herein.

 13.17 _Conspicuousness of Provisions_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Agreement that are set out in "bold" satisfy the requirement of the "express negligence rule" and any other requirement at law or in equity that provisions contained in a contract be conspicuously marked or highlighted. 

  

 13.18 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts including by facsimile or electronic transmission, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 13.19 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Schedules and the Exhibits attached hereto which are incorporated herein by reference supersede all prior and contemporaneous negotiations, understandings, letters of intent and agreements (whether oral or written) between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and constitute the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with respect thereto. 

  

 13.20 _Like-Kind Exchange_. Buyer may elect to engage in a "like-kind exchange" under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "1031 Rules") with the Assets as "replacement property" under the 1031 Rules ("Buyers Exchange Transaction"). If Buyer so elects, and at Buyers reasonable request, Seller shall perform such actions and execute such documents as Buyer believes to be necessary or appropriate to facilitate Buyers Exchange Transaction; provided however that (i) Buyer agrees to hold Seller harmless from and against any expenses or liability for performing such actions or executing such documents and (ii) Buyer shall not be permitted to assign any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with any such transaction.
