controlled Affiliates, in whole or in part; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, that</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> (i)&nbsp;in the event of such assignment or delegation, any such controlled Affiliate shall

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Calculation of Time Period</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which any
act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

SIZE=2><I>Headings. </I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this Agreement into Articles, Sections and other
subdivisions and the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to
any "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

immediately following it. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>Reasonable Commercial Efforts</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. Reasonable commercial efforts means that the obligated party is required to make a
diligent, reasonable and good faith effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such obligation, however, does not require that the obligated party act in a manner that would be contrary to
reasonable commercial practices under the circumstances in order to accomplish the objective. </FONT></P>

throughout the periods covered thereby (except, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, for the absence of notes thereto), and shall be certified as true, complete and correct in all
material respects by an appropriate officer of Seller. Seller shall make available to Buyer, and Buyer's auditors, Seller's work papers and backup materials (subject in each case to the execution of a

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Seller
and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer or employee of such other party
or Affiliates thereof (each an "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Indemnified Party</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, amounts paid in settlement, penalties, fines, interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) (collectively, "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Losses</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting
from, or relating to: (i)&nbsp;any failure of any representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party to have been true and correct when made or deemed made as of the Closing Date, or at such
different date or period specified for such representation or warranty; or (ii)&nbsp;the breach by such party of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the extent not
waived by the other party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Seller
further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party of Buyer from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party of
Buyer arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i)&nbsp;any of the Excluded Liabilities; (ii)&nbsp;Seller's failure to comply with applicable Bulk Sales Laws notwithstanding the waiver
contained in Section&nbsp;2.9; and (iii)&nbsp;any claims with respect to, or arising out of, any Business Employee in connection with any Benefit Plan or such Business Employee's employment or
termination thereof with Seller or any of its Affiliates and any Liabilities that are obligations of the Seller or any of its Affiliates under Section&nbsp;5.4. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Buyer
further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party of Seller from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party of
Seller arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i)&nbsp;any of the Assumed Liabilities; (ii)&nbsp;medical, health or disability claims of any Transferred Employee under any benefit plan
of Buyer or its Affiliates; (iii)&nbsp;any Liability of Buyer with respect to FPGA/FPSC Business or the Purchased Assets, solely with regard to conditions or events occurring after the Closing, in
each case as conducted or used by Buyer after the Closing; and (iv)&nbsp;any Liabilities of Buyer with respect to, or arising out of, the employment by Buyer or the termination of employment by
Buyer of any Transferred Employee after the Closing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Amounts
payable in respect of the parties' indemnification obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree to use their
reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate in the preparation of a supplemental Asset Acquisition Statement as required by Section&nbsp;5.3 and Treasury Reg. &sect;
1.1060-1(e)(1)(ii)(B) as a result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the preceding sentence. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third-Party Claim, both parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or as provided in Section&nbsp;5.1. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;The
amount of the Indemnifying Party's liability under this Agreement shall be net of any applicable insurance proceeds (reduced by the incremental costs of any
increase in premiums related to such receipt of proceeds) actually received by, and Tax savings (net of all Tax costs and other effects that would result from any such Tax savings, including the
positive and negative effects on any Tax attributes of Buyer), that actually reduce the overall impact of the Losses upon, the Indemnified Party. In computing the amount of any such Tax savings, the
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the
incurrence of any payment of any indemnified Loss. Notwithstanding this Section&nbsp;9.2(e), in no event shall any Indemnified Party be required to take any action, or forebear from exercising any
right, with respect to its Taxes or the filing of its Returns. The indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article&nbsp;9 shall inure to the benefit of each Indemnified Party of
the other party hereto on the same terms as are applicable to such other party. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party's liability for all claims made under Section&nbsp;9.2(a)(i)&nbsp;shall be subject to the following limitations: (i)&nbsp;the
Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed $1,500,000, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all
Losses starting from the first dollar of such Losses, and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnifying Party's aggregate liability for all such claims shall not exceed $100,000,000. Notwithstanding the above
provisions of this Section&nbsp;9.2(f), the limitations provided in this Section&nbsp;9.2(f) shall not apply to (i)&nbsp;any claim for fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or (ii)&nbsp;any
claim for breach of any agreement or covenant contained herein. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;The
indemnification provided in this Article&nbsp;9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties to this
Agreement for breach of any of the covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained herein; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, this exclusive remedy for
damages does not preclude a party from (i)&nbsp;bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable remedy for a breach of covenant or agreement under this Agreement, or
(ii)&nbsp;pursuing remedies under applicable Law for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or
consequential loss or damage (including any loss of revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the foregoing shall not be
construed (i)&nbsp;to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims and (ii)&nbsp;shall not apply to any remedies under applicable Law
for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Both parties shall mitigate their damages as may be required by applicable Law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rights to indemnification under this Section&nbsp;9.2 shall not be subject to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any
Indemnified Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;General Procedures for Indemnification</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The
Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall promptly notify in writing the party against whom indemnification is sought (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Indemnifying Party</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by any third party, in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by such failure). The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion
of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Third-Party Claim</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), to assume the
defense and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim (with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) that (i)&nbsp;involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages, or
(ii)&nbsp;involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the
primary claims asserted by the third party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the claims for money damages and, such equitable relief, if reasonably expected to be awarded, would
not be reasonably expected to be material to Buyer; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that the Indemnifying Party shall not impair the defense of the Indemnified Party
with respect to any claims for equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. Failure by the Indemnifying Party to so notify the Indemnified Party shall be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying Party
of its right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of
any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The
Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent or agree to a compromise or
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld subject to
the next sentence) unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party's prior written consent, enter into any
compromise or settlement that (i)&nbsp;commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii)&nbsp;does not provide for a complete written release by such third party of
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent
such Third-Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary
relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;9.3 with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;In
the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by
such failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim shall have been incurred. Such notice shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such
a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section&nbsp;9.2,
(i)&nbsp;pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii)&nbsp;notify the Indemnified Party
if it wishes to contest the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss by stating with particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount thereof. </FONT></P>
