    (A) entitle any Transferred Employee to continue his or her employment with
Buyer or its Affiliates and in the event that they are no longer employed by
Buyer to continue their salary and benefits with Buyer or (B) prevent Buyer

 (g) Seller shall make and be solely responsible for payment, if any, under the Agere Short Term Incentive Plan and any other incentive compensation payments to Transferred Employees for the period from October 1, 2001 to the Closing Date in accordance with the Agere Short Term Incentive Plan or any other short-term incentive plan in effect for such period. 

  

 (h) Following the Closing, subject to the human resources policies of Buyer and the discretion and approval of the board of directors of Buyer, the Transferred Employees shall be eligible to receive grants of options to purchase common stock of Buyer. Such grants to Transferred Employees will be made in a manner consistent with Buyer\'s general policies with respect to equity compensation at the time of such grants. 

  

 (j) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its controlled Affiliates to, comply with any and all Liabilities or other obligations under the Benefits Plans to all Business Employees, including Transferred Employees, whether resulting from, arising out of, or relating to, events or circumstances occurring prior to or after the Closing, in accordance with the terms of such Benefits Plans.

employment and instruct such Persons to comply with such restrictions.

  

 5.10 Non-Competition 

  

 (a) Seller agrees that, as part of the consideration for the payment of the Purchase Price, for the period of five (5) years immediately following the Closing Date in the case of items (b)(i) and (b)(ii) below, and for the period of three (3) years immediately following the Closing Date in the case of item (b)(iii) below, neither Seller nor any of its controlled Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, for its own benefit or as agent of another, carry on or own, manage or operate, perform, participate in, control the management or operation of, or allow its name to be used as a brand in or for, or have any ownership interest in, any Competing Business (i) in the County of Santa Clara, California, (ii) in the State of California, (iii) in the County of Washington, Oregon, (iv) in the State of Oregon, (v) in the County of Lehigh, Pennsylvania, (vi) in the State of Pennsylvania, (vii) in the United States of America or (viii) anywhere else in the world. 

  

 (b) For purposes of this Section 5.10, a " _Competing Business_ " shall mean the design, manufacture, support, marketing or sale of (or the investment in or acquisition of any manufacturer of) any "stand alone" integrated circuit comprising (i) a general purpose array of logic gates (whether AND arrays or OR arrays) which can be interconnected by programming a matrix of interconnect lines between the logic gates, including any accompanying circuitry to provide I/O buffer control and protection, programming control and data path, embedded memory and other embedded subsidiary circuitry, timing control and distribution clocking, voltage control and regulation, and chip protection functions (a " _Programmable Logic Device_ "); or (ii) a general purpose array of logic blocks built from basic logic gates or LUTs (Look Up Tables) which can be interconnected by programming a matrix of interconnect lines between the logic blocks, including any accompanying circuitry to provide I/O buffer control and protection, programming control and data path, embedded memory and other embedded subsidiary circuitry, timing control and distribution clocking, voltage control and regulation, and chip protection functions (a " _Field Programmable Gate Array_ "); or (iii) Programmable Logic Device or Field Programmable Gate Array that is combined on an integrated circuit with other devices (including without limitation, networking communication, SERDES or other communication cores, memory, microprocessors, embedded analog circuitry, or other functions of integrated circuitry), regardless of whether any of the above devices is marketed as a Programmable Logic Device or Field Programmable Gate Array or FPSC; _provided, however_ , that for the purposes of this clause (iii), a device in which the Programmable Logic Device or the Field Programmable Gate Array forms no more than 40% of the die area of such device shall not be considered within the scope of any such combined device. 

  

 (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.10 shall (i) limit Seller or its Affiliates (A) from acquiring (including through a merger) or investing in any business, development arrangement or joint venture in which a Competing Business constitutes, represents or is responsible for not more than 25% of the revenues or earnings of such business, development arrangement or joint venture, or (B) from, directly 

    or indirectly, holding or making investments in securities of any business
so long as Seller\'s direct or indirect holdings do not exceed 5% of the
outstanding equity securities thereof, or (C) from incorporating, combining
or using Third Party standard, commercially available Programmable Logic
Devices or Field Programmable Gate Arrays in the form of discrete chips in
Seller\'s products, or (ii) apply to any Person who acquires, directly or

 (d) Seller recognizes and agrees that compliance with the covenant contained in this Section 5.10 is necessary to protect Buyer, and that a breach by Seller of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 5.10 could cause irreparable harm to Buyer, that Buyer\'s remedies at law in the event of such breach would be inadequate, and that, accordingly, in the event of such breach, a restraining order or injunction or both may be issued against Seller without the requirement that Buyer post a bond, in addition to any other rights and remedies which are available to Buyer. If this Section 5.10 is more restrictive than permitted by the Laws of any jurisdiction in which Buyer seeks enforcement hereof, this Section 5.10 shall be limited to the extent required to permit enforcement under such Laws. In particular, the Parties intend that the covenants contained in the preceding portions of this Section 5.10 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each location specified. Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical in terms. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants deemed included in this Section 5.10, then such unenforceable covenant shall be deemed eliminated from these provisions for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine the foregoing covenant to be unenforceable with respect to the term or the scope of the subject matter or geography covered thereby, then such covenant shall nevertheless be enforceable by such court against the other party upon such shorter term or within such lesser scope as may be determined by such court to be reasonable and enforceable. 

  

 5.11 No Negotiation or Solicitation 

  

 Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates will not (and Seller will cause each of its employees, officers, directors, representatives and agents not to) (a) solicit, initiate, consider, entertain, encourage or accept the submission of any proposal or offer from any third party relating to the direct or indirect acquisition of the FPGA/FPSC Business or (except to the extent permitted by Section 5.2) any portion of the Purchased Assets, or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations (and as of the date hereof, Seller shall immediately cease any discussions or negotiations that are ongoing) regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any third party to do or seek any of the foregoing. Seller will notify Buyer promptly if any third party makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the foregoing (including the terms thereof and the identity of such third party subject to any existing applicable confidentiality agreement or applicable Law) within two Business Days after receipt of any such offer or proposal. 

  

 5.12 Customer Commitments 

  

 _Schedule 5.12_ contains a list of customer commitments of the FPGA/FPSC Business (the " _Customer Commitments_ "). Buyer agrees that following the Closing Date it shall use reasonable commercial efforts to continue to honor and perform such Customer Commitments.

6. Confidential Nature of Information 

  

 6.1 Confidentiality Agreement

 6.2 Seller\'s Proprietary Information 

  

 (a) Except as provided in Section 6.2(b), after the Closing and for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that it will keep confidential all of Seller\'s and its Affiliates\' Proprietary Information that is received from, or made available by, Seller or is otherwise exposed to Buyer in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, for purposes of this Section 6.2, information about the FPGA/FPSC Business\'s business plans and strategies, marketing ideas and concepts, especially with respect to unannounced products and services, present and future product plans, pricing, volume estimates, financial data, product enhancement information, business plans, marketing plans, sales strategies, customer information (including customers\' applications and environments), market testing information, development plans, specifications, customer requirements, configurations, designs, plans, drawings, apparatus, sketches, software, hardware, data, prototypes, connecting requirements or other technical and business information, except for such Proprietary Information as is conveyed to Buyer as part of the Purchased Assets.

 (i) at the time of disclosure was already known to Buyer other than as a result of this transaction, free of restriction as evidenced by documentation in Buyer\'s possession;

If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is in the opinion of Buyer\'s counsel compelled to disclose the Proprietary

significant penalty, Buyer (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Proprietary Information shall not be deemed confidential and Seller shall have no obligation with respect to any such Proprietary Information that, following the Closing:

 (c) If Seller (or any of its Affiliates) is requested or required (by oral question, interrogatory, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such Proprietary Information, Seller will promptly notify Buyer of such request or requirement and will cooperate with Buyer such that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller (or any of its Affiliates) is in the opinion of Seller\'s counsel compelled to disclose the Proprietary Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or significant penalty, Seller (or its Affiliate) may disclose only so much of the Proprietary Information to the party compelling disclosure as is required by Law. Seller will exercise its (and will cause its Affiliates to exercise their) reasonable commercial efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Proprietary Information.

Notwithstanding anything in this Article 6 to the contrary, (a) in the event that any such Proprietary Information is also subject to a limitation on disclosure or use contained in another written agreement between Buyer and Seller or either of their respective Affiliates that is more restrictive than the limitation contained in this Article 6, then the limitation in 

    such agreement shall supersede this Article 6, and (b) the restrictions on
confidentiality set forth in any Collateral Agreement shall supersede this
Article 6 for the information subject thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may disclose these agreements to its advisors and consultants, to
its lenders and in connection with any merger, sale or similar transaction
provided that any such party agrees to the same confidentiality obligations
applicable to the providing party.

Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any claim or action with respect to any such representations or warranties after such Expiration Date. 

     9.2 General Agreement to Indemnify 

  

 (a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer or employee of such other party or Affiliates thereof (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, amounts paid in settlement, penalties, fines, interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees, court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any failure of any representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party to have been true and correct when made or deemed made as of the Closing Date, or at such different date or period specified for such representation or warranty; or (ii) the breach by such party of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the extent not waived by the other party. 

  

 (b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party of Buyer from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party of Buyer arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any of the Excluded Liabilities; (ii) Seller\'s failure to comply with applicable Bulk Sales Laws notwithstanding the waiver contained in Section 2.9; and (iii) any claims with respect to, or arising out of, any Business Employee in connection with any Benefit Plan or such Business Employee\'s employment or termination thereof with Seller or any of its Affiliates and any Liabilities that are obligations of the Seller or any of its Affiliates under Section 5.4. 

   

 (c) Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party of Seller from and against any Losses incurred or suffered by such Indemnified Party of Seller arising out of, resulting from, or relating to: (i) any of the Assumed Liabilities; (ii) medical, health or disability claims of any Transferred Employee under any benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates; (iii) any Liability of Buyer with respect to FPGA/FPSC Business or the Purchased Assets, solely with regard to conditions or events occurring after the Closing, in each case as conducted or used by Buyer after the Closing; and (iv) any Liabilities of Buyer with respect to, or arising out of, the employment by Buyer or the termination of employment by Buyer of any Transferred Employee after the Closing. 

  

 (d) Amounts payable in respect of the parties\' indemnification obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree to use their reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate in the preparation of a supplemental Asset Acquisition Statement as required by Section 5.3 and Treasury Reg. § 1.1060-1(e)(1)(ii)(B) as a result of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to the preceding sentence. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, both parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith or as provided in Section 5.1. 

   

 (e) The amount of the Indemnifying Party\'s liability under this Agreement shall be net of any applicable insurance proceeds (reduced by the incremental costs of any increase in premiums related to such receipt of proceeds) actually received by, and Tax savings (net of all Tax costs and other effects that would result from any such Tax savings, including the positive and negative effects on any Tax attributes of Buyer), that actually reduce the overall impact of the Losses upon, the Indemnified Party. In computing the amount of any such Tax savings, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence of any payment of any indemnified Loss. Notwithstanding this Section 9.2(e), in no event shall any Indemnified Party be required to take any action, or forebear from exercising any right, with respect to its Taxes or the filing of its Returns. The indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article 9 shall inure to the benefit of each Indemnified Party of the other party hereto on the same terms as are applicable to such other party. 

     (f) The Indemnifying Party\'s liability for all claims made under
Section 9.2(a)(i) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability for such claims until the
aggregate amount of the Losses incurred shall exceed $1,500,000, in which case
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for all Losses starting from the first
dollar of such Losses, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party\'s aggregate liability
for all such claims shall not exceed $100,000,000. Notwithstanding the
above provisions of this Section 9.2(f), the limitations provided in this
Section 9.2(f) shall not apply to (i) any claim for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, or (ii) any claim for breach of any agreement or covenant
contained herein.

  

 (g) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of the covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained herein; _provided, however_ , this exclusive remedy for damages does not preclude a party from (i) bringing an action for specific performance or other equitable remedy for a breach of covenant or agreement under this Agreement, or (ii) pursuing remedies under applicable Law for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential loss or damage (including any loss of revenue or profit) arising out of this Agreement, _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not be construed (i) to preclude recovery by the Indemnified Party in respect of Losses directly incurred from Third Party Claims and (ii) shall not apply to any remedies under applicable Law for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Both parties shall mitigate their damages as may be required by applicable Law. 

  

 (i) The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.2 shall not be subject to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to such Indemnified Party\'s claim for indemnification. 

  

 9.3 General Procedures for Indemnification 

  

 (a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall promptly notify in writing the party against whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by any third party, in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by such failure). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), to assume the defense and control the settlement of such Third-Party Claim (with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) that (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money damages, or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted by the third party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the claims for money damages and, such equitable relief, if reasonably expected to be awarded, would not be reasonably expected to be material to Buyer; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not impair the defense of the Indemnified Party with respect to any claims for equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. Failure by the Indemnifying Party to so notify the Indemnified Party shall be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of its right to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. 

     (b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be,
shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense,
the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided
in this Agreement.

  

 (c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent or agree to a compromise or settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld subject to the next sentence) unless such settlement or judgment relates solely to monetary damages. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified Party\'s prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete written release by such third party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim involving money damages for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense pursuant to this Section 9.3 with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered prejudice by such failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim shall have been incurred. Such notice shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.2, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if it wishes to contest the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss by stating with particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or amount thereof.
