ARTICLE II

  

MERGER

  

  

Section 2.01 Merger. On the Effective Date, as defined in Section 8.01, CFB
will merge with and into SFNC, with SFNC being the surviving corporation
("Surviving Corporation"), pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effects
provided in, the Arkansas Business Corporation Act. At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of SFNC, as the Surviving Corporation,
shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of SFNC as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time; the directors and officers of SFNC
shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation; SFNC shall
continue to possess all of the rights, privileges and franchises possessed by
it and shall become vested with and possess all rights, privileges and
franchises possessed by CFB; and SFNC shall be responsible for all of the
liabilities and obligations of CFB in the same manner as if SFNC had itself
incurred such liabilities or obligations, and the Merger shall not affect or
impair the rights of the creditors or of any persons dealing with SFNC or CFB.

  

  

Section 2.02 Conversion of CFB Common Stock.

  

  

(a) Definitions.

  

  

(i) "Exchange Ratio" shall mean 17.8975 shares of SFNC Stock for each share of
CFB Common Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.03.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

(ii) "Merger Consideration" shall mean the number of whole shares of SFNC
Stock, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of CFB Common Stock so held in accordance with Sections 2.02 and 2.03,
plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of SFNC Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.05, plus any dividends or other distributions
to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(c).

  


 

  

 

(iii) "Average Closing Price" of SFNC Stock shall be the average of the
closing price per share of SFNC Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another
alternative source as chosen by SFNC) for the twenty (20) consecutive trading
days ending on and including the tenth (10th) trading day preceding the
Effective Date.

  

  

(iv) "Minimum Merger Consideration" shall be the product of (x) $28.30
multiplied by (y) the number of shares of SFNC Stock to be issued to CFB
shareholders in exchange for CFB Common Stock in the Merger.

  

  

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.02 and Section 2.03,
upon consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
each share of CFB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting Shares, as defined in Section 2.07)
shall be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of SFNC
Stock as shall equal the Exchange Ratio. All shares of CFB Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate, as defined in Section 2.05,
previously evidencing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. The holders of Certificates previously
evidencing shares of CFB Common Stock, outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
CFB Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by law. Such
Certificates previously evidencing shares of CFB Common Stock shall be
exchanged for (i) certificates evidencing whole shares of SFNC Stock issued in
consideration therefor and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares as set forth
in Section 2.05, upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
the provisions of Section 2.05, without interest. No fractional shares of SFNC
Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made
pursuant to Section 2.05.

  

 

  

(c) Each share of CFB Common Stock held in the treasury of CFB and each share
of CFB Common Stock owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
CFB immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

  

  

 

Section 2.03. Adjustment to Computation of Merger Consideration.

 

  

 

  

(a) The aggregate number of shares of SFNC Stock to be exchanged for each
share of CFB Common Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any
change in the number of shares of SFNC Stock by reason of any stock dividends
or splits, reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with respect to
SFNC Stock, received or to be received by holders of SFNC Stock, when the
record date or payment occurs prior to the Effective Time. No adjustment of
the Exchange Ratio shall occur by reason of issuance of (i) any SFNC Comp.
Shares under the SFNC Stock Comp. Plans, (ii) the issuance of any SFNC stock
in any other merger or other acquisition transaction or (iii) the issuance of
any SFNC Stock for cash in a public offering.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

 

  

(b) The aggregate number of shares of SFNC Stock to be exchanged for each
share of CFB Common Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect any
change in the number of shares of CFB Common Stock by reason of any stock
dividends or splits, reclassification, recapitalization or conversion with
respect to CFB Common Stock, received or to be received by holders of CFB
Common Stock, when the record date or payment occurs prior to the Effective
Time. All outstanding unvested restricted shares of CFB Common Stock, except
CFB Double Trigger Restricted Stock, shall be vested as of the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of the CFB Stock Plan and shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration on the same basis as all other shares of CFB Common
Stock. A reduced number of shares may be accepted under the CFB Stock Plan
with the balance of such shares being exchanged to pay the tax consequences of
the vesting. All outstanding unvested CFB Double Trigger Restricted Stock
shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration on the same basis as all other
shares of CFB Common Stock, but shall not be fully vested until otherwise
vested or forfeited pursuant to the terms similar to the CFB Stock Plan. The
Exchange Ratio set forth in Section 2.02 (a) above is based upon 370,108.017
shares of CFB Common Stock, consisting of 363,918.017 shares of CFB Stock
outstanding and 6,190 shares of unvested restricted stock under the CFB Stock
Plan, all as of the Effective Time. If the number of outstanding shares of CFB
Common Stock or the number if of restricted shares of CFB Common Stock granted
and in effect, as of the Effective Time, differs from the foregoing, then the
Exchange Ratio shall mean the number (computed to four decimal places) that
shall equal the quotient of (A) 6,624,000, divided by (y) the number of shares
of CFB Common Stock outstanding plus the number of restricted shares of CFB
Common Stock granted and in effect, at the Effective Date.

  

  

(c) In the event (i) the Average Closing Price of SFNC Stock shall be less
than $28.30; and (ii) the percentage difference between:

  

 


 

  

(A) $35.37 (the average of the closing price of SFNC Stock for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on and including March 12, 2014) and (B) the
Average Closing Price

  


 

 

  

 

is not equal to at least 80% of the percentage difference between:

 

  

 


 

  

(Y) $38.43 (the average of the closing price of the PowerShares KBW Regional
Banking Portfolio ("KBWR") for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending
on and including March 12, 2014 and (Z) the average of the closing price of
the KBWR (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby,
another alternative source as chosen by SFNC) for the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on and including the tenth (10th) trading day preceding
the Effective Date,

 

  

 


 

  

then CFB may give notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement as provided
in Section 7.01(e) hereof; subject to SFNC's right, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to maintain the Exchange Ratio and opt to pay an amount of cash so
that, as a result of such adjustment, the Merger Consideration, based on the
Average Closing Price, shall be no less than the Minimum Merger Consideration.
If SFNC elects to make the Walkaway Counter Offer (as defined in Section
7.01(e)), it shall give prompt written notice to CFB of such election (the
"Walkaway Counter Offer Notice"). The Walkaway Counter Offer Notice, if given,
shall set forth the amount of the cash to be paid and shall include a
calculation of the adjusted Merger Consideration.

 

  

 


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

(d) Upon the occurrence of any adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.03, any
references in this Agreement to any defined term whose calculation is affected
by such adjustment shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the defined term as
calculated after giving effect to such adjustment.

  

  


 

 

  

Section 2.04 Conversion of CFB Series C Preferred Stock.

  

  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.02, upon consummation of
the Merger at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger each share of CFB
Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive one share of SFNC
Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1,000.00
per share ("SFNC Series A Preferred Stock"). All shares of CFB Series C
Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously
evidencing any such shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive an
equal number of shares the SFNC Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of
certificates previously evidencing shares of CFB Series C Preferred Stock,
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of CFB Series C Preferred Stock except as
otherwise provided herein or by law. Such certificates previously evidencing
shares of CFB Series C Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for (i) certificates
evidencing whole shares of SFNC Series A Preferred Stock issued in
consideration therefor.

  

  

(b) Each share of CFB Series C Preferred Stock held in the treasury of CFB and
each share of CFB Series C Preferred owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of CFB immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

  

  

Section 2.05 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, SFNC shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with Registrar and Transfer Company ("Transfer Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of CFB Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, through the Transfer Agent, (i) certificates
evidencing a number of shares of SFNC Stock equal to the sum of the shares of
SFNC required to be issued as Merger Consideration to the shareholders of CFB,
and (ii) cash in the amount of $20,000.00 ("Fractional Share Fund"). In the
event the initial sum deposited into the Fractional Share Fund is insufficient
to satisfy all payments required to be paid from such fund, then SFNC shall
immediately deposit funds to remedy such deficiency.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, SFNC will instruct the Transfer Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of CFB
Common Stock and each holder of record of "book entry" shares of CFB Common
Stock (such "book entry" shares have been issued to the holder of record
without a certificate) (other than Dissenting Shares) (both certificated
shares of CFB Common Stock and "book entry" shares of CFB Common Stock defined
herein as "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
SFNC may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates evidencing shares
of SFNC Stock, cash or a combination thereof. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that
number of whole shares of SFNC Stock which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the shares of CFB Common Stock formerly evidenced by
such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02, (B) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of SFNC Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02, and (C) any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of CFB Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of CFB, a certificate evidencing the proper number of shares
of SFNC Stock may be issued and cash paid in accordance with this Article II
to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such shares of CFB Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.05, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective
Time with respect to SFNC Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of SFNC Stock evidenced thereby, and no other part of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to any such holder, until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
delivered and paid to the holder of the certificates (i) certificates
evidencing whole shares of SFNC Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, payable to such holder,
including the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share of
SFNC Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(b) and
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of SFNC
Stock, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of SFNC Stock. No interest shall be paid on the Merger
Consideration.

  

  

(d) All shares of SFNC Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of CFB Common Stock.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Fractional Share Fund which remains undistributed to
the holders of CFB Common Stock on the date six months following the Effective
Time shall be delivered to SFNC, upon demand, and any holders of CFB Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter
look directly to SFNC for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

(f) SFNC shall not be liable to any holder of shares of CFB Common Stock for
any Merger Consideration, whether shares of SFNC Stock, cash or dividends or
distributions with respect to SFNC Stock, delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

  

(g) SFNC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of CFB
Common Stock such amounts as SFNC is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by SFNC, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of CFB Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by SFNC.

  

  

Section 2.06 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of CFB shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of CFB Common Stock or CFB Series C Preferred Stock
thereafter on the records of CFB. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates for CFB Common Stock presented to the Transfer Agent or SFNC for
any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration and any
certificates for CFB Series C Preferred Stock presented to the Transfer Agent
or SFNC for any reason shall be converted into an equal number of shares of
SFNC Series A Preferred Stock.

  

  

Section 2.07 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of CFB Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by shareholders who
shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Title 48, Chapter
23 of Tennessee Code Annotated shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be entitled
to receive payment of the fair value of such shares of CFB Common Stock held
by them in accordance with the provisions of such statute, except that all
Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to judicial
determination of the value of the shares of CFB Common Stock under such
statute shall have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of
the Effective Time, for the right to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration, as if such shares of CFB Common Stock, upon
surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.05, of the Certificate or
Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of CFB Common Stock.

  

  

Section 2.08 Lost CFB Common Stock Certificates. In the event any Certificate
for CFB Common Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon receipt
of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft or destruction and to the
ownership of such Certificate by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and the receipt by SFNC of appropriate and customary
indemnification, SFNC will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, a certificate of shares of SFNC Stock and the cash
payment, if any, deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance
with this Article II.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 2.09 Options and Rights. There are no options, warrants or rights
granted by CFB to purchase shares of CFB Common Stock, which are outstanding
and unexercised and there are no outstanding securities issued by CFB, or any
other party, convertible into CFB Common Stock.

party hereto of any representation, warranty or agreement contained herein
which is not cured or not curable within 60 days after written notice of such

required in order for CFB's Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary
duties to CFB's shareholders under applicable law, provided that CFB shall pay
SFNC a fee, in immediately available funds, in the amount of $10,000,000 in
advance of or concurrently with such termination.

  

  

Section 7.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either SFNC or CFB, as provided above, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto or their respective officers or directors, except that any such
termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of any party hereto
arising out of the willful breach by any other party of any covenant or
willful misrepresentation contained herein.

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

  

  

This LOCK-UP AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made as of the ____ day of __________,
2014, by _________________________ ("Holder"), in connection with his or its
ownership of shares of Simmons First National Corporation ("Company"), an
Arkansas corporation.

  

  

RECITALS:

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
May 6, 2014 ("Merger Agreement") with Community First Bancshares, Inc.
("CFB"), a Tennessee corporation, pursuant to which CFB shall first merge with
and into the Company ("Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company has negotiated certain terms of the Merger Agreement,
which require the execution of this Agreement as a condition precedent to
closing of the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Holder is willing to enter into this Agreement in connection with
the Merger on the terms provided herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these presents and for such other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Holder agrees as follows:

  

  

1. Background. (a) Holder is the beneficial owner of _______ shares of the common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company, and this Agreement will apply to 50,000 of such shares ("Shares") and not any shares acquired by Holder hereafter.

  

  

(b) Holder understands that, as a condition to closing the Merger, the Company
has agreed to obtain an agreement from Holder to refrain from selling the
Shares from the date of this Agreement until the second anniversary of the
Effective Time of the Merger ("Restriction Period"), except as specified in
Section 2 below.

  

  

2. Sale Restriction. (a) Holder hereby agrees that during the Restriction Period, Holder will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares. Holder further agrees that the Company is authorized to (x) place a restrictive legend on any certificates issued during the Restriction Period evidencing the Shares, and (y) to place "stop orders" on its books and with its transfer agent to prevent any transfer of Shares of the Company held by Holder in violation of this Agreement. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts not to allow any transaction inconsistent with this Agreement, but in the event of a material adverse change in financial circumstances of the Holder where there may be a liquidity need of the Holder, Company agrees to work with Holder in meeting Holder\'s liquidity needs.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions on transfer, Holder may, at any
time and from time to time during the Restriction Period, transfer all or a
portion of the Shares (i) as bona fide gifts or transfers by will or intestacy
and (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or
the immediate family of the Holder, provided that any such transfer shall not
involve a disposition for value; provided, that, in the case of any gift or
transfer described in clauses (i) and (ii), each donee or transferee agrees in
writing to be bound by the terms and conditions contained herein in the same
manner as such terms and conditions apply to the undersigned.

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

(c) All restrictions under this Agreement will terminate immediately if the
Holder (or another Holder with whom the Holder is affiliated) is a director of
the Company or its subsidiaries, and either (i) the Holder ceases to be a
director as a result of Holder\'s death, disability as defined under the
Company\'s disability insurance plan, or removal as a director by the Company
or its subsidiaries without cause.

  

  

(d) All restrictions under this Agreement will terminate immediately if there
is a merger, acquisition, or other transaction which results in the Company
not being the surviving corporation or in the event that any action is taken
to delist the Shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (except for actions to
list the Shares on a more widely traded platform).

  

  

(e) In the event of any stock dividend, stock split or consolidation of shares
or any like capital adjustment of any of the outstanding securities of the
Company, all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to
which Holder becomes entitled by reason of ownership of the Shares shall be
subject to restriction with the same force and effect as the Shares subject to
restriction immediately before such event.

  

  

3. Miscellaneous. (a) At any time, and from time to time, after the signing of this Agreement, Holder will execute such additional instruments and take such action as may be reasonably requested by the Company to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Arkansas without regard to principles of conflicts of
laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought only in the state
courts of Arkansas or in the federal courts located in the State of Arkansas.
The parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waive any objection to
jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert
any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon forum non
conveniens. The parties executing this Agreement and other agreements referred
to herein or delivered in connection herewith agree to submit to the in
personam jurisdiction of such courts and hereby irrevocably waive trial by
jury. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party
its reasonable attorney\'s fees and costs. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is
invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then
such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict
therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of
law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any
agreement.

  

  

(c) All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals, and other
communications required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and, unless
otherwise specified herein, shall be (i) personally served, (ii) deposited in
the mail, registered or certified, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,

machine, at the address or number designated below (if delivered on a business
day during normal business hours where such notice is to be received), or the
first business day following such delivery (if delivered other than on a

(d) The restrictions on transfer described in this Agreement are in addition
to and cumulative with any other restrictions on transfer otherwise agreed to
by Holder or to which Holder is subject under applicable law.

  

  

(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon Holder, its legal representatives,
successors, and assigns.

  

  

(g) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts each of which shall be
deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument.

  

  

(h) The Company agrees not to take any action or allow any act to be taken
that would be inconsistent with this Agreement.

  

  

(i) Holder acknowledges that this Agreement may not be amended without the
